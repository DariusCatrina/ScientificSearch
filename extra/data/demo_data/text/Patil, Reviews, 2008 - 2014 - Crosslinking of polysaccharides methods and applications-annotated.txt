Polysaccharides are polymers of simple sugar building blocks. Crosslinked polysaccharides are 
having many applicat ions in pharmaceuticals. Different methods are available for crosslinking of 
polysaccharides. Different chemical and physical methods are summarized and discussed. 
Chemical crosslinking of polysaccharide is highly versatile method with good mechanical stab ility. 
However, the crosslinking agents used are not only affects the integrity of substances but are often 
toxic compounds, which have been extracted from gel before they can be applied. Such adverse 
effects are avoided with the use of physically crosslin ked gels. 
Introduction
Polysaccharides are polymers of simple sugar building blocks. Polysaccharides functions as 
thickeners, stabilizers, suspending agents, gelling agents, film formers, aerating agents, flocculants, 
binders, emulsifiers, lubricants, texturing agents and structuring agents1,2. Polysaccharides are 
primarily used to thicken or gel water and are frequently classified into two groups thickeners and 
gelling agents3.Gelling agents are more difficult to use than thickeners and their use is c omplicated 
by the fact each requires its own set of procedure to produce satisfactory gel4. Thus polysaccharides 
are hydrated in an aqueous environment thereby creating the gel structure called hydrogel. Aqueous 
solutions of hydrophilic polymers at low or moderate concentrations, where no substantial 
entanglement of chains occurs, normally show Newtonian behavior. On the other hand, once 
crosslinking between different polymer chains are introduced, the so obtained network shows 
visco -elastic and sometimes p ure elastic behavior. As the term implies, crosslinks have to be 
present to avoid dissolution of hydrophilic polymer chains into aqueous phase5-13. A great variety of 
methods for crosslinking has indeed been used. Since it is advantageous for many applicat ions that 
the hydrogels are biodegradable, labile bonds are frequently introduced in the gel. These bonds can 
be present either in polymer backbone or in the crosslinks used to prepare gel. The labile bonds can 
be broken under physiological conditions eith er enzymatically or chemically; in most of cases by 
hydrolysis13. Crosslinked polysaccharides were used for coating and/or embedding medicinal active 
substances or drug compositions. The invention furthermore relates to a drug which contains an 
active subs tance which acts in the large intestine or an active substance which is broken down on 
passing through the stomach or small intestine could be coated with or embedded in one of the 
crosslinked polysaccharides14. In this review methods of crosslinking of po lysaccharides are 
described and discussed. Chemical and physical methods are used for crosslinking of 
polysaccharides. In physical crosslinking dissolution is prevented by physical interaction which 
exists between different polymer chains. In chemical cros slinking covalent bonds are present 
between different polymer chains. 

Physical crosslinking: 
In recent years there has been increase in interest in physical crosslinking. The main reason is that 
use of crosslinking agents is avoided. These agents cannot only affect the integrity of substances to 
be entrapped e.g. proteins, cells, but these agents are often toxic compounds which have to be 
removed or extracted from the gel before they can be applied. In physical crosslinking, 
polysaccharides forms crosslin ked network with counterion at the surface. High counterion 
concentration would require longer exposure times to achieve complete crosslinking of the 
polysaccharides. For physical crosslinking different methods have been investigated. Crosslinking 
by ionic interaction: Alginate is a well -known example of polysaccharide that can be crosslinked by 
ionic interactions. Alginate is a polysaccharide with mannuronic and glucuronic acid residues can 
be crosslinked by calcium ions15. Crosslinking can be carried out at room temperature and 
physiological pH. Therefore alginates gels can be frequently used as matrix for the encapsulation of 
living cells16and for the release of proteins17. The release of proteins from the alginate 
microparticles obtained by spraying a s olution of sodium alginate into an aqueous solution of 
calcium chloride can be modulated by coating the particles with cationic polysaccharide for 
example chitosan18,19. Polycations can be crosslinked by anions. Chitosan is an amino -
polysaccharide obtained by alkali induced deacetylation of chitin. Chitosan based hydrogels were 
obtained by croslinking with glycerol -phosphate disodium salt20. Interestingly, in presence of this 
salt, chitosan solution remains liquid below room temperature, but quickly gel whe n heated. 
Biological materials, proteins and chondrocytes, were incorporated prior to the injection within the 
thermogelling solution.20Carrageenan a polysaccharide composed of 1,4 -linked -α-D-galactose and 
1, 3 linked -β-D-galactose with a variable portion of sulfate groups, forms a gel with potassium ions, 
but also shows gelation under salt -free conditions. However, gels prepared in the presence of 
metallic ions were substantially stronger than those obtained under salt -free conditions21. Ionically 
crossli nked chitosan hydrogels are formed by complex formation between chitosan and polyanions, 
such as dextran sulfate or polyphosphoric acids22
.Doxorubicin was encapsulated in nanoparticl esof 
the chitosan hydrogels. This particle showed a minimal burst release and retained good in vitro 
cytotoxicity due to released drugs. Alginate was ionically crosslinked by immersing in aqueous 
solution of calcium acetate of different molarities at time . Permeability of acetaminophen in 
hydrated calcium alginate film was studied. Permeability depends upon the concentration of 
calcium acetate solution and immersion time. The highest limiting permeability was observed in 
film prepared using the highest con centration of calcium acetate for greater time. It is suggested 
that this is result of rapid croslinking of sodium alginate at the surface which in turn shows the 
diffusion of calcium ions into the film23. Gellan gum is a linear anionic polysaccharide prod uced by 
the microorganism Pseudomonas elodea24. Hydrophilic drug, propranolol hydrochloride was 
encapsulated in gellan gum beads in an aqueous environment by the ionotropic gelation method. 
Optimal preparation conditions allowed a very high incorporation efficiency (92%). Storage 
conditions (wet or dry state) and the time of storage did not modify the release of the drug25
.Cross -
linked calcium -gellan beads containing diclofenac sodium as model drug, using full 33factorial 
design were prepared. Drug quantity, pH of cross -linking solution, and speed of agitation were 
selected as variables for factorial design. Studies indicate that, in addition to drug:polymer ratio, pH 
of cross -linking solution and speed of agitation also influence the formation and properties of 
calcium -gellan beads26. Thus ionotropic gelation with gellan gum seems to offer new opportunities 
in the field of bioencapsulation and could be useful for the encapsulation of fragile drugs. Also 
crosslinked chitosan and alginat e films are promising for control led drug delivery applications. 
Crosslinking by crystallization: Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water soluble polymer. When 
aqueous solutions of PVA are stored at room temperature they gradually form a gel with, however, 
alow mechanical strength. Interestingly, once aqueous solution of this polymer undergoes freeze -
thawing process a strong and highly elastic gel is formed27. Addition of alginate to the PVA 
solution before freeze -thawing, the gel properties could be modulat ed. With increase in 
concentration of alginate, the mechanical strength of gel increased which was associated with a 
decrease in release of model drug28. Hydrophobised polysaccharides: Examples of polysaccharides 
reported in literature used for preparation of physically crosslinked hydrogels by hydrophobic 
modification are chitosan, dextran, pullulan and carboxy methyl curdlan29-35. This compound forms 
monodisperse hydrogel nanoparticle of 20 -30 nm with high water content upon dialyzing a solution 
from DMSO against PBS buffer. Various proteins such as α chymotrypsin, BSA and insulin have 
been incorporated. As example, the hydrophobic antitumour drug adriamicin (ADR) was taken up 
inside the particles by simply mixing the pullulan suspension with ADR31. Slow r elease was 
observed at pH 7.4, which increases at lower pH of the medium due to increased solubility of drug. 
The stability of the drug was increased, however due to poor cellular uptake of the complexes and / 
or slow release of ADR, the invitro cytotoxici ty against HeLa cells appeared rather low. Rapid 
complexation was also observed for insulin approximately 10 molecules of insulin were taken up 
inside the pullulan particles within 10 minutes after mixing32. The resulting microenvironment 
protected the pro tein effectively against the thermal denaturation aggregation and enzymatic 
degradation. Dissociation of insulin occurred on addition of BSA, which may provide a basis for 
invitro release of the insulin. Indeed the in vivo activity of insulin loaded nanoparticles was similar 
to that free insulin after i.v. injection. By covalent attachment of lactoside or galactoside to the 
pullulan backbone, nanoparticles were obtained which show bind ing to the receptor β -D-galactose -
specific lectin RCA 120, which provides a possibility for a cell -specific targeting. In vitro they were 
more effectively internalized than conventional nanoparticles by cells expressing galactose -specific 
receptors such as rat hepatocytes and HepG2 cells, in contrast to cells which lack such receptors33. 
Moreover, biodistribution studies showed enhanced accumulation in the liver. Self assembled 
hydrogels nanoparticles have also been prepared from carboxy methyl curdlan, a po lysaccharide 
having anti -tumor activity, by substitution with a hydrophobic sulfonyl urea35. Release of the anti -
cancer drug all -trans retinoic acid from these nanoparticles showed first order kinetics. An 
increased drug -loading and degree of hydrophobic m odification resulted in a slower release. Upon 
conjugation of lactobionic acid to the CM -curdlan, specific binding to HepG2 cells was observed in 
vitro. Another example of a hydrophobized polysaccharide is the water soluble glycol chitosan 
substituted with palmitoyl chains. They assemble into unilamellar polymeric vesicles in the 
presence of cholesterol36. These polymeric vesicles are found to be biocompatible and 
haemocompatible and capable of entrapping water -soluble drugs37. Highly porous solid materials
are obtained after freeze drying, which are hydrated without swelling to 20 x its dry weight in 
alkaline buffer38. In contrast to most chitosan based materials, the hydration decreased in acidic 
environment, which was attributed to the higher erosion rate at low pH. Chitosan has been grafted 
with PL(G) by Qu et. al., in which the hydrophobic polyester side chains are responsible for the 
hydrophobic interactions in water39, 40. Reversible water uptake of the materials was observed when 
the pH was switched b etween 2.2 and 7.4, the lowest pH providing the highest swelling due to 
charge repulsion by protonation of the free amine groups on the polymer backbone. The maximum 
water uptake in the protonation form depends on the glycolic acid / lactic acid content. O ther 
chitosan hydrogels that respond to external charges like pH or temperature have been prepared by 
grafting with poly(acrylic acids) (PAAc)41or poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)42In 
addition to chitosan, also carboxy methyl dextran has been grafte d with PNIPAAm chains aming at 
thermosensitive hydrogels43. Cloud point measurements were conducted in this case, indicating a 
phase transition at around 38°C, but no data on hydrogel characteristics have been reported yet. 
Chemical crosslinking:
Chemical crosslinking of polysaccharide is highly versatile method with good mechanical stability. 
During crosslinking counterions diffused into the polymeric and crosslinking agent reacts with 
polysaccharides forming either intermolecular or intramolecula r linkages. Factors which affect 
chemical crosslinking are concentration of crosslinking agent and crosslinking time. The high 
concentration of crosslinking agent induces rapid crosslinking. Like physical crosslinking high 
counterion concentration would re quire longer exposure times to achieve complete crosslinking of 
the polysaccharides44. Chemical crosslinking is carried out by following methods. 
Crosslinking by radical polymerization: 
Chemical crosslinking can be carried out by radical polymerization i n presence of crosslinking 
agent. In particular dextran is used as building block for (degradable) hydrogels. Dextran is a 
bacterial polysaccharide, consists essentially of -1,6 linked D -glucopyranose residues. The low 
molecular weight fractions of dextran (Mw between 40 and 100 kDa) have been used as plasma 
expander45 which has resulted in a good documentation of pharmacological activities and side 
effects of dextran. Dextran has therefore been investigated for the delivery of drugs, proteins and 
imaging a gents46. Moreover, due to presence of dextranase in colon, dextran based gels are under 
investigation as a colon delivery system47. Research on polymerizable dextran was pioneered by 
Edman et al.48who reacted dextran dissolved in water with glycidylacryla te. A hydrogel was 
formed after the addition of an initiator system containing of NNNN tetramethylene -diamine and 
ammonium peroxydisulfate to an aqueous solution of the acryldextran also containing NN 
methylenebisacrylamide. Enzymes were immobilized with a lmost full retention of their activity by 
an emulsion polymerization technique in microspheres of polyacryldextarn.48, 49. A method has 
been developed to synthesize methacrylated dextran. Dextran is dissolved in a suitable aprotic 
solvent (DMSO) after whic h derivatization with glycidylmethacrylate (GMA) catalyzed by 4 -(N-N-
dimethyl amino) pyridine, is carried out. Almost quantitative incorporation of GMA was found and 
the degree of substitution can be fully controlled. A detailed analysis by NMR50and by th e mass 
spectroscopy of the products obtained after enzymatic degradation51revealed that under the 
selected conditions the reaction of GMA and dextran was a transesterification resulting in a dextran 
derivative with the methacyrlate group directly attached to the dextran chain. The synthetic 
procedure developed was also suitable to derivatize other compounds with methacrylate groups, 
among which are inulin52and sucrose53. Meth(acrylate) groups can also be introduced in water -
soluble polymers using (meth)ac ryloyl chloride,54,55methacrylic anhydride,56and by the subsequent 
reaction of dextran with bromoacetyl bromide and sodium acrylate57. Moreover, using enzymes as 
catalyst, (meth) acrylic groups have been introduced in mono and disaccharides, which can be used 
for synthesis of hydrogels58, 59, 60. The synthesis is carried out in anhydrous pyridine and products 
are normally obtained in a high yield. In contrast to chemical methods, enzymatic synthesis results 
in a very good regeoselectivity. A polymerizable dextran derivative was obtained by reaction of 
dextran with maleic anhydride. These dextran derivatives can be converted into a hydrogel by UV -
induced polymerization of the vinyl groups. The gels were not degradable under physiological 
conditions. They di d, however, exhibit a strong pH dependant swelling behavior due to the 
presence of carboxylic acid groups in the network61. In synthesis of methacrylated dextran 
derivatives the polymerizable groups are connected via a) hydrolytically sensitive group(s) to a 
dextran backbone. The hydrolysable groups are either a carbonated ester or lactic acid groups. After 
polymerization these derivatives the gel degraded under physiological conditions due to the 
presence of (carbonate) ester groups in the crosslinks, yiel ding dextran, lactic acid and short 
fragments of Poly(2 hydroxy ethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) as degradation products62. Chitosan 
undergoes crosslinking by radical induced polymerization in presence of potassium persulfate at 
60°C, leading to extensive crosslinking of fragmented chains on subsequent cooling at 4°C. As a 
result a possible conformation change leading to higher crystallinity, as evidenced by IR, X -ray and 
CNMRwas observed. Chitosan crosslinking leads to formation of permanently covalent ne twork, 
which may allow the free diffusion of water/bioactive material and also enhance the mechanical 
properties. Chemical crosslinks are formed by irreversible covalent links as in covalently 
crosslinked chitosan. Thus allow drug delivery to be efficientl y controlled63. 
Crosslinking by aldehyde: 
In order to establish crosslinking, rather drastic conditions have to be applied (low pH, high 
temperature etc.). This has especially been investigated for the preparation of crosslinked amine 
containing polysaccharides64. Because glutaraldehyde is a toxic compound that even at low 
concentration shows cell growth inhibition, alternatives has been developed. Crosslinking of gelatin 
using polyaldehydes obtained by partial oxidation of dextr an has been reported65. These gels were 
designed for application in wound treatment and epidermal growth factor (EGF) was incorporated 
to promote wound healing. The release rate of EFC decreased with increase in storage time which 
was ascribed to the ongoi ng processes of both chemical crosslinking and physical structuring of the 
hydrogel matrix. Poly(aldehydeguloronate) obtained by oxidation with periodate of partially 
depolymerized alginate, can be crosslinked with adipic acid dihydrazide and converted int o a 
hydrogel. The swelling and degradation of the gel could be controlled by the amount of adipic acid 
dihydrazide66. These hydrogel films have therefore potential to act as a delivery matrix for 
sustained release of drug at wound sites67. The procedure fo r the preparation of crosslinked chitosan 
microspheres coated with polysaccharides or lipid for intelligent drug delivery system is reported. 
The microspheres were prepared with an inverse emulsion of 5 -FU or its derivative solution of 
hydrochloric acid of chitosan in toluene containing SPAN 80. Chitosan was crosslinked with 
Schiff’s salt formation by adding glutaraldehyde toluene solution. At the same time, the amino 
derivatives of 5 -FU were immobilized, obviously resulting in an increase in the amount of drug 
within the microspheres. The microspheres were coated with anionic polysaccharides (e. g. 
carboxymethylchitin, etc.) through a polyion complex formation reaction. The results revealed that 
the coating layers of microspheres were effective barriers to 5-FU release68. 
Crosslinking by addition reaction:
Polysaccharides can be crosslinked with 1,6 -hexa -methylenediisocyanate or 1,6 -hexanedibromide 
and many other reagents. The network properties can be easily tailored by the concentration of the 
dissolved p olysaccharide and the amount of crosslinking agent. The crosslinking reactions are 
preferably carried out in organic solvents, because water can also react with the crosslinking agent. 
Further, since the crosslinking agents are generally speaking very toxi c, the gels have to be 
extracted extensively to remove traces of unreacted agents. Once these matrices are aimed for the 
release of pharmaceutically active agent, they have to be loaded after the gel formation and 
extraction process. This means that protei n molecules can be loaded in meshes of the gels which are 
larger than the protein and these systems therefore show typically first -order release. This often 
results in a limited duration of the release. Finally, between the polymer chains, linkages are 
established which are stable. This means that degradation only occurs once the polymer backbone 
is degraded by enzymes69, 70, 71. 
Crosslinking by condensation reaction:
A very efficient reagent to crosslink polysaccharides with amide bonds is NN-(3-
dimethyla minopropyl) -N-ethyl carbodiimide. In order to obtain alginate gels with better mechanical 
properties than the ionically crosslinked gels, Mooney et al. developed a method to a covalently 
crosslink this polymer. Alginate and PEG -diamines were crosslinked us ing N-ethyl carbodiimide. 
The mechanical properties could be controlled by the amount of PEG -diamine in the gel and 
molecular weight of PEG72. 
Characterization of crosslinked polysaccharides: 
Characterization of crosslinked polysaccharides were done by i nfrared spectroscopy, X -ray 
diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and by water uptake methods44, 63.
