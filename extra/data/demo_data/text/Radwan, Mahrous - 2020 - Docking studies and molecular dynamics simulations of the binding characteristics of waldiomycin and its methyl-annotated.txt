Abstract
Bacterial histidine kinases (HKs) areconsidered attractive drug targets because oftheir abil-
itytogovern adaptive responses coupled withtheir ubiquity. There areseveral classes of
HKinhibitors; however, theysuffer from drug resistance, poor bioavailability, andalackof
selectivity. The3Dstructure ofStaphylococcus aureus HKwasnotisolated inhigh-resolu-
tioncoordinates, precluding further disclosure ofstructure-depen dent binding tothespecific
antibiotics. Toelucidate structure-depen dent binding, the3Dstructure ofthecatalytic
domain WalK ofS.aureus HKwasconstructed using homology modeling toinvestigate the
WalK–ligand binding mechanisms through molecular docking studies andmolecular dynam-
icssimulations. Thebinding freeenergies ofthewaldiomycin anditsmethyl ester analog
were calculated using molecular mechanics/ generalized born surface area scoring. Thekey
residues forprotein–ligand binding were postulated. Thestructural divergence responsible
forthe7.4-fold higher potency ofwaldiomycin than thatofitsester analog wasclearly
observed. Theoptimized 3Dmacromolecule –ligand binding modes shed lightontheS.
aureus HK/WalK–ligand interactions thatafford ameans toassess binding affinity todesign
newHK/WalK inhibitors.
Introduction
Protein kinases (PKs) catalyze thephosphorylation ofother proteins and thus play crucial
roles notonly incellregulation butalso insignal transduction. Cell dysregulation isoften asso-
ciated with adisease. Thus, PKs areconsidered asimportant targets indrug discovery pro-
grams that seek toalter their function [1,2]. Particularly, histidine kinases (HKs) are
responsible forsensing conditions that allow microbes toadopt apathogenic lifestyle through
theexpression ofvirulence factors. Thus, theinhibition offactors that aredistinctly unique to
thebacterial celland express virulence ofpathogenic bacteria offers achance forspecific inter-
ference from thehost biochemical processes. Nowadays, itisclear that virulence isanadaptive
genetic response involving thegenes encoding theinduction ofvirulence factors [3,4]. This

response implies that pathogenic microbes cansense when itisinaninvasion state. Sensing of
environmental stimuli occurs through two-component signaling (TCS) systems that appears
almost ubiquitously inbacteria. Bacteria respond toextracellular changes through TCS path-
ways, which aremediated byHKs and areabsent inhumans [5].The adaptive and response
ability ofbacteria isvital forsurvival insevere environments that they encounter [6].
TheStaphylococcus aureus bacteria TCS system comprises HKprotein, containing amem-
brane-bound sensor histidine kinase (WalK), and aresponse regulator (RR) protein, contain-
ingaconserved DNA-binding domain (WalR) [7].WalK isamembrane-linked HKthat
consists oftwodomains. One domain isacatalytic orATP-binding domain and thesecond is
adimerization domain that includes aconserved phosphorylated histidine residue.
HKs areactivated asaresult oftheinteraction ofexternal stimuli with itsextracellular sig-
naling domain. The activated HKs bind ATP atitscatalytic domain WalK, which catalyzes the
transfer ofthea-phosphate group ofATP toaconserved histidine residue ontheHKdimeriza-
tion and histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain. The phosphoryl group transfers from the
conserved phosphorylated histidine onaHKtoaspartic acid conserved inanRRdomain pro-
tein, theHK’s associated signaling partner. The RRproteins harbor both theRRdomain and
theDNA-binding domain. The phosphorylation ofRRresults initsactivation and subse-
quently triggers ittobind toDNA and stimulate gene transcription, producing aresponse to
theextracellular stimulus (Fig 1)[5,8]. Antibacterial activity canbeafforded byinhibiting the
microbial HKusing ATP competitive inhibitors [9,10].
The TCS-WalK/WalR system that isunique togram-positive bacteria, including S.aureus
[11],Bacillussubtilis [12], andEnterococcus faecalis [13], iscrucial forsurvival and isattracting
growing interest asanovel target ofantibacterial agents [14]. Representative inhibitors, RWJ-
49815, closantel, and tetrachlorosalicylanilide, have been reported asactive inhibitors against
several bacterial TCS transduction systems [15–17]. Unfortunately, fewTCS inhibitors have
been reported againstS.aureus, amajor pathogen with ahigh virulence factor. The amino acid
sequence oftheWalK/WalR TCS transduction histidine protein kinase ofS.aureus (strain
Mu50/ATCC 700699) ARLS_STAAM (Q7A2R7) [18] iswell defined; however, the3Dstruc-
ture isunavailable intheprotein databank (PDB) (https://www.rcsb.org/).
Forcase inwhich theatomic structures ofenzyme macromolecules areabsent, homology
modeling isapowerful tool tounderstand thegeneral fold oftheenzyme, catalytic site, and
conserved residues, inaddition tothesubstrate and inhibitor binding sites. This information
iscrucial forstructure-based drug design approaches forthedevelopment ofpotential enzyme
inhibitors fortherapeutic application [19]. Inaddition, waldiomycin and itsmethyl ester ana-
log,produced byStreptomyces sp.,were reported asinhibitors ofS.aureus HKwith IC50values
of10.2 and 75.8μM, respectively, and areeffective asantibacterial agents againstS.aureus spe-
cies[20]. This information isalso helpful fortheligand-based drug discovery ofnovel lead
compounds with potential activity againstS.aureus bacteria.
Inthisstudy, weperformed insilico modeling toexplore themode ofinhibition oftheS.
aureus HK/WalK enzyme bywaldiomycin and itsmethyl ester analog. The study includes
homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and molecu-
larmechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations. The calculations were
performed ontheS.aureus kinase structure (WalK catalytic domain) toinvestigate themacro-
molecule–ligand complex and predict the3Dstructure ofS.aureus HK/WalK. TheS.aureus
HK/WalK conformation changes persuaded intheMD simulations and theligand binding
free energies ofwaldiomycin and itsester analog, ascalculated using theMM/GBSA method,
confirm thedependencies ofsiteactivity ontheligands’ electrostatic and hydrophobic proper-
ties. Lys100 wasfound tobeacrucial residue forthe7.4-fold higher potency ofwaldiomycin
than that ofitsester analog againstS.aureus HK/WalK.

aureus kinase 3Dstructure wasbuilt bymeans ofhomology modeling followed bystructure
optimization using anMD simulation. The optimized macromolecule structure wasthen used
fordocking analyses. Because oftheir almost similar structures and thelarge difference in
their potencies asS.aureus HK/WalK inhibitors, waldiomycin and itsester analog [20] were
selected and their 3Dstructures were also built, optimized, and then docked into thehomol-
ogy-built and optimized S.aureus HK/WalK structure. TheS.aureus HK/WalK–ligand com-
plexes were further subjected tooptimization viaMD simulations. Lately, theMD simulation
trajectories were used asinputs fortheMM/GBSA calculation ofbinding free energies ofthe
ligands and investigation oftheir binding mechanism.
Homology modeling
The homology modeling ofS.aureus HK/WalK secondary structure wasperformed todevelop
theinitial structure needed fortheMD simulation study. Briefly, theBLAST sequence database
search module wasutilized toobtain theX-ray structures similar tothetarget sequence Q7A2R7
[22] andsort them according tosimilarity percent. Using theMODELLER program, thetop-
scoring PDB entry wassuggested asatemplate foralignment ofthetarget Q7A2R7 tobuild the
homolog model. During themodeling process, theposition ofthecrystallized ligand waskept in
itsoriginal position forrebuilding thebinding cavity. The obtained homology model was
checked formissing atoms and/or residues using thePROCHECK program [23]. Gaps andmiss-
ingcoordinates were repaired using theMODELLER program [24] andtheresulting structure
wasused astheinitial structure inthenext MD simulation optimization process.
Protein preparation
The AMBER18 program [25] wasutilized toperform thestructural minimization and MD
simulations using theff14SB force field amino acid parameters. The tleap module ofAmber-
Tools18 wasused toaddthecomplementary hydrogen atoms that could notbedetected byX-
raycrystallography. The protein molecule wasexplicitly solvated with water molecules and
sodium counter-ions were also added toobtain aneutral system. Awater boxwith 10Åthick-
ness wascreated using theTIP3P water solvent model tocompletely surround theprotein mol-
ecule. Simulation wasperformed using aperiodic boundary condition. Long-range
electrostatic interactions were processed using theparticle–mesh Ewald protocol [26] and a
cut-off value of8Åwasused fornon-bonding interactions. Initial minimization ofthewater
molecules and counter-ions wasperformed using 1000-cycle minimizations; subsequently, the
whole system wasminimized using 1000-cycle minimizations. Then, asystem temperature
increase to298.15 Kwasperformed and MD simulations at298.15 Kwere executed with the
fixed protein coordinates. The equilibrations were performed under theconstant normal tem-
perature and pressure (NPT) ensemble for170ps.Inthefirst 20ps,thewaters and counter-
ions were equilibrated, while thesolutes were restrained. Inthenext 50ps,theside chains of
theprotein amino acids were relaxed, then alltherestraints were removed inthelast100ps.
Lastly, MD simulations of10nswere processed at1atm and 298.15 Kunder theNPT ensem-
blewith atime step oftwofemtoseconds (fs). The covalent bonds with hydrogen atoms were
constrained bytheuseoftheSHAKE algorithm [27] and Langevin dynamics were used tocon-
trolthesystem temperature. Throughout theMD simulations, alloftheatom coordinates of
thesystem were saved every 1ps.
Ligand preparation
Waldiomycin and itsmethyl ester 1,2were reported asinhibitors ofS.aureus HKwith IC50
values of10.2 and 75.8μM, respectively [20]. The chemical structures and compound names

aregiven inFig3.The antechamber module [28,29] intheAmberTools18 program wasused
togenerate theforce field parameters oftheligands. The general AMBER force field was
applied totheligands, and theLeap program wasused togenerate thetopology and parameter
files.
Docking study
The docking procedure wasperformed using theDock6.4 program [30] onanubunto
14.2-supported Dell 5000 workstation (Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)i7-5500U CPU @
2.40GHz with a64-bit operating system,×64-based processor, memory of7.7GiB). The dock-
ingmethod wasvalidated using 5C93 proteins and co-crystalized ligand ACP using thedefault
parameters, except with asphere of10Ådiameter around thebinding sitecenter. The co-crys-
tallized ligand ACP wasdocked intheoriginal binding pocket oftheprotein structure. The
docking protocol wasvalidated according totheroot-mean-square deviation (RMSD) ofthe
docking pose relative totheACP X-ray structure.
The refined tertiary structures ofS.aureus HK/WalK and HK/WalK inhibitor compounds
1,2were prepared intheir physiological protonation states. Compounds 1and 2were docked
using thesame settings forthevalidation process ofthedocking program. The resulting solu-
tions were clustered based ontheheavy atom RMSD values (1Å).Finally, thetop-scoring
binding pose wastaken into consideration forligand–receptor interactions and wasselected
forfurther refinement using MD simulations.
MD simulations ofcomplexes
MD simulations were performed fortheHK–ligand complexes obtained viadocking using the
same procedure explained intheMD optimization described above, including system minimi-
zation, heating, and equilibration. MD simulations were performed foratime period of35ns
foreach macromolecule–ligand complex. The atom coordinates inthecomplex system were
saved at1-ps time intervals throughout thesimulations. Using theinitial structures oftheMD
simulation asthereference structures, theCPPTRAJ module ofAmberTools18 wasused for
determining RMSDs tovalidate theconvergence oftheMD simulation processes. Structural
flexibilities oftheprotein were estimated bycalculating root-mean-square fluctuations
(RMSFs). The trajectories during last20nsofequilibration MD simulations were used forcal-
culating theRMSF values, whereas theaverage structures ofthefinal 20nstrajectories were
used asthereference structures.
Hydrogen bond analysis. The CPPTRAJ module inAmber18 wasused toanalyze hydro-
genbonding between theligand and thesurrounding amino acid residues. Hydrogen bonds
with high occupancy were observed during thelast8.0nsofthesimulations forthetwoligand
complex systems.
Pairwise per-residue free energy decomposition. Molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltz-
mann surface area (MM/PBSA) pairwise decomposition wasused tocalculate theinteraction
energy oftheresidues involved inhigh-occupancy hydrogen bonding totheligand during the
last8nsofthesimulation.
Binding free energy calculation
The MM/GBSA method [31] wasused tocalculate thebinding free energy (ΔGbinding), Eq
(1)forreceptor–binder complex systems. One thousand snapshots were taken at20–30 ns
time intervals throughout theMD simulation trajectory tocompute theMM/GBSA free
energy difference. Foreach snapshot, Eq(1)wasused tocalculate thebinding free energy of

Results anddiscussion
Structure optimization
With anidentity of36%, thesequence ofS.aureus UID-Q7A2R7 [18] hasthehighest-ranked
homology intheBLAST search forE.colihistidine kinase, 5C93 [34], onproteins inthePDB.
Generally, itisassumed that twoproteins topologies areusually similar once their sequences
share about 30% identity [35]. Moreover, Dimitrii etal.[36] developed structures ofaverage
quality (RMSD<4.0Å)based ontarget-template sequence identity�20%. The crystal struc-
ture of5C93 wasrecently obtained ataresolution of2.52Å[34]. Therefore, the3Dstructure
ofS.aureus HK, built through ahomology model tothe5C93 template structure, should be
appropriate formodeling S.aureus HKprotein binding data. The initial alignment ofQ7A2R7
with thetemplate sequence 5C93 wasobtained using ClustalW. The final alignment (36%
identity) used inthehomology modeling and inthesecondary structure prediction isshown
inFig4.The initial homology models ofS.aureus HKwere built using MODELLER and used
forfurther optimization.
MD simulation isusually practiced toimprove homology models [37]. Using MD simula-
tion, theinitial 3Dstructure ofS.aureus HK/WalK, obtained from homology modeling, was
optimized inasolvent tosimulate therealphysiological environments. During theMD simula-
tion, thestability ofthestructure wascalculated byitsdeviance from thestarting conformation
inRMSD terms. Fig5Ashows theRMSD values ofS.aureus HK/WalK protein structure
through thewhole MD simulation trajectory. After 7ns,the3Dstructures ofHK/WalK
reached astable state where theRMSDs oftheprotein backbone atoms and ofallatoms con-
verged to1.25Åand 2.25Å,respectively. Fig5Bshows thecalculated RMSFs oftheS.aureus
HK/WalK structure generated during theMD simulation, which characterizes themobility of
individual residues. The Ramachandran plot oftheoptimized S.aureus HK/WalK structure
showed that 100% ofresidues were located intheallowable regions (S1Fig), higher than that
oftheinitial homology modeled 3DS.aureus HK(S2Fig), which showed 93.4% ofresidues in
theallowed region, indicating thehigher stability oftheoptimized S.aureus HKstructure.
Binding modes generated bymolecular docking
Redocking oftheACP X-ray structure initsoriginal binding siteresulted inasolution pose
with 0.704Åand RMSD value S3Fig.
Toshed light onthepossible binding modes ofcompounds 1and 2,alarge boxwasdefined
toinclude allpotential binding sites. Hence, thetwoligands adopted themost favorable bind-
ingposes that were searched and ranked according totheir docking scores. The conformation
with thelowermost score, suggesting themost probable binding mode ofaligand, wassug-
gested foradditional analysis.
The twobinders were efficiently docked inside thebinding siteoftheHK/WalK structure.

with thedifference intheir experimental inhibition ofS.aureus HK/WalK, with IC50values of
10.2 and 75.8μM, respectively. The top-scoring binding poses ofthetwobinders were selected
forfurther investigations using MD simulation.
Although docking studies have been successfully used incalculating thebinding poses of
ligands formany proteins, they failed inassessing ligand binding affinity [38]. The treatment
ofproteins as“rigid” molecules does notconsider their conformational changes during the
docking ofsome ligands [39]. Conformational changes during protein–ligand interactions
could bestudied during MD simulations. The conformation changes inprotein–ligand inter-
actions have been broadly studied through MD simulation methods [40]. Considering both
protein structure flexibility and protein–ligand electrostatic interactions, MD simulations

were deemed necessary tojustify the7.4-fold potency difference inanti-S.aureus HK/WalK
activity between waldiomycin and itsester analog and torefine theunderstanding ofwaldio-
mycin (ester)-HK/WalK binding modes obtained from molecular docking. Ligand (waldiomy-
cinoritsmethyl ester) conformation changes were observed through alltheMD simulation
time frames. MD simulation wasinitiated from thedocked minimized complex and continued
forover 35ns.Using RMSD changes during theMD simulations, thedynamic stabilities ofthe
twocomplex systems were calculated and areplotted inFig7Aand 7B.
Forthecomplexes ofS.aureus HK/WalK bound with waldiomycin, Fig7A,both thewal-
diomycin and theprotein structures were equilibrated with unobvious RMSD fluctuations
through the35nstime frames. Interestingly, trajectory analysis revealed that thecarboxyl
group ofwaldiomycin isengaged instable hydrogen bond with Lys100. The presence ofa
hydrogen bond between theLys100 residue ofHK/WalK and waldiomycin (active anti-HK)
and itsabsence with thewaldiomycin methyl ester (inactive anti-HK) suggests that Lys100 isa
crucial residue forS.aureus HKactivity.
The complexes ofS.aureus HK/WalK bound with waldiomycin methyl ester (Fig 7B)
showed unobvious RMSD fluctuations over thefirst 11ns,then agradual increase from 11–14
ns,followed byarapid increase from 14to14.5 ns,and convergence from 14.5 to35ns.The
large RMSD fluctuations suggest alarge conformational change and repositioning ofthewal-
diomycin ester inside thebinding siteresulting infour conformational changes (Fig 7B;beige
color): holds for0–11 ns,(7b; cyan color), holds during the11–14 ns,(Fig 7B;pink color),
holds during the14–14.5 ns(Fig 7B;green color), and continues over thelast14.5–35 ns.
Remarkably, trajectory analysis revealed that theester group ofthewaldiomycin methyl ester
exited thebinding pocket after 14.5 ns;thisconformational instability during MD simulation
isunsurprising since aweak binding affinity wasreported forthisbinder.
The superimposition ofbinding conformation from thefinal snapshots oftheMD simula-
tions isshown inFig8(waldiomycin: gray; waldiomycin methyl ester: cyan) and reveals differ-
entligand binding conformations, though theMD simulations started from docking poses
with similar orientations.
The CPPTRAJ hydrogen bond analyses arelisted inTable 1and show thehydrogen bonds
with high occupancy forthetwosimulation systems. The table shows twodifferent hydrogen
bond setsforthetwocomplex systems. Forthewaldiomycin-HK/WalK complex, theamino
acid residues Lys63, Ser98, Lys100, Gln128, Asp135, Lys139, and Val184 showed ahydrogen
bond with theligand. Forthewaldiomycin ester-HK/WalK complex, theamino acid residues,
Lys63, Leu102, and His103 showed ahydrogen bond with theligand. The hydrogen bond pat-
tern difference between thetwosimulation systems isanindication ofthetwodifferent bind-
ingconformations ofwaldiomycin and itsester analog (Fig 8).
The MM/PBSA-pairwise decomposition [41] ofresidue interaction energies developed an
insight into theinteractions between thebinders and their binding sites forHK/WalK. The
results demonstrated that theamino acid residues Lys100, Asp135, Lys139, and Val140 play a
crucial role ineffective binding interactions with waldiomycin and showed absolute decom-
posed energy intherange of–2.722 to–4.371 kcal mol-1(Table 1).
Although theMM/GBSA approach does notconsider theentropy associated with thebind-
ing, itisanefficient and powerful tool forthecorrect ranking ofligands. Although theinclu-
sion oftheconformational entropy iscrucial forcalculating theabsolute free energies of
binding, itisnotnecessary forranking thebinding affinities ofsimilar inhibitors [42].
The binding free energies ofthetwoligands were calculated using MM/GBSA methods
according totheMD simulation trajectories from 25to35ns.The total binding free energy

between waldiomycin and thekeyresidue Lys100 wasrecognized and postulated tobetherea-
sonforthe7.4-fold higher potency ofwaldiomycin than that ofitsester analog.
Conclusions
Inarecent study, aninhibitors ofS.aureus HK/WalK enzyme, waldiomycin, wasreported to
have 7.4-fold higher potency than itsother inhibitor, waldiomycin ester. The twoinhibitors
have thesame structures butdiffer with regard toonly onepharmacophore. Knowledge ofthe
compounds’ binding free energies iscrucial toevaluate itspotential antibacterial activity. The
tertiary structures ofS.aureus HK/WalK arecrucial tounderstanding HK/WalK–ligand inter-
actions forevaluating potential anti-S.aureus activity. The amino acid residue Lys100 wascru-
cialforhydrogen bonding with waldiomycin atthebinding siteand possibly played an
essential role intheenzyme activity. The results ofourwork onbinding interactions between
theligands andS.aureus HK/WalK would beuseful forfurther studies, including thedesign-
ingofmore efficient antibacterial agents that targetS.aureus HK/WalK.
