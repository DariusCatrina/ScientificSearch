Introduction  
3 1.1. Starch and the products of its hydrolysis  
Starch, the main energy storage component in plants, is present in the form of 
granules. These granules are highly organized semi -spherical structures that, depending 
on the plant source, present different morphology and composition. The differences in 
the granules stem from the proportions and packaging of amylose and amylopectin - the 
two types of glucose polymers bound by glycosidic bonds. These two components of 
starch also differ in structure and their properties.  
Amylose is a nearly linear polymer of  glucose units joined with α -(1,4) -glycosidic 
bonds, with only 0.2 -0.8% of branches formed by α -(1,6) -glycosidic bonds (Maningat et 
al. 2009 ). In wheat starch nearly 25% of the glucose units are present in the form of 
amylose (Swinkels 1985 ). The remaining 75% cons titute the branched molecules of 
amylopectin. Around 5% of the glucose units in wheat amylopectin are bound by α(1,6) -
glycosidic linkages (Maningat et al. 2009 ). Amylopectin branches have different lengths, 
characteristic of the source of starch and the position within the macromolecule. The 
chain length distributions are a form of characterizing amylopectin, by distinguishing 
three main types of chains ( Figure 1.1 ). The A chains are the outer chains linked by α -
(1,6) -glycosidic bonds to the inner chains of amylopectin. The B chains form the main 
part of the clusters and carry A chains and other B chains. The C chain is the sole carrier 
of a red ucing glucose unit (Hizukuri and Maehara 1990 ). The exact arrangement of these 
types of chains in amylopectin is still being investigated, as the older cluster model 
(Hizukuri 1986 ) and the alternative building block model (Bertoft 2013 ) are still 
debated in literature.  
 
Figure  1.1 A scheme representing the branched structure of amylopectin, following the cl assical cluster 
model. The A, B and C chains are indicated.  
The most common modification of starch on industrial scale is the enzymatic 
hydrolysis. During hydrolysis, enzymes break the long chains of amylose and 

Chapter 1  
4 amylopectin into shorter molecules. Dependin g on the enzyme’s mode of action, the 
most common final products of starch hydrolysis can be maltodextrins, glucose, fructose 
or maltose.  
The hydrolysis of starch is generally preceded by gelatinization. Gelatinization is 
a term that includes all events o ccurring as starch is heated in water: absorption of 
water by the starch granules, increase of the apparent viscosity of the solution, breakage 
of granules and exposure of amylose and amylopectin. The exposure of the substrate 
increases the rate of the enz ymatic reaction by providing an easier access for the 
enzyme.  
Conventionally, the hydrolysis of starch by α -amylase is referred to as 
liquefaction, because α -amylases lower the viscosity of the gelatinized starch (liquefy) 
by reducing the length of amylose  and amylopectin. The products of starch liquefaction 
are called maltodextrins. Maltodextrin is a mixture of poly - and oligosaccharides with a 
broad molecular weight distribution. This mixture includes maltose, malto -
oligosaccharides and linear and branche d dextrins. The composition of maltodextrins 
depends on both the source of the enzyme and the source of starch. The final product 
composition will be influenced by both the intrinsic enzyme characteristics (e.g., activity 
and stability at different tempera tures and pH values) and extrinsic characteristics, 
attributed to the substrate, including degree of gelatinization and amylose -amylopectin 
ratio ( Marchal et al. (1999) , Murthy et al. (2011) ). Maltodextrins can be used as carriers, 
bulking agents, crystallization inhibitors, coatings, flavour car riers, fat replacers or 
texturisers ( Kennedy et al. (1988) , Marchal et al. (1999) , White et al. (2003) ).  
If desired, maltodextrins can be further hydrolysed, e.g., by glucoamylases in a 
process called saccharification. The goal of saccharification is produci ng glucose syrups 
by decomposing starch to its monomer - glucose. Glucose syrups depending on their 
degree of hydrolysis, are used in food production (e.g., jams, soft drinks), frozen 
desserts, confectionery, brewing and fermentation (Kennedy et al. 1988 ).  
Dextrose equivalent (DE) values are used to characterize starch hydrolysates. 
The dextrose equivalent expresses the extent of s tarch hydrolysis. It is a measure of the 
total reducing power of the sugars in relation to glucose and on a dry mass basis (van 
der Maarel et al. 2002 ). The  higher the value of dextrose equivalent the greater the 
extent of hydrolysis and the lower the average molecular mass of the oligomeric 
Introduction  
5 products. DE is an average value, and as such provides only an indication of the extent of 
hydrolysis. Mixtures with th e same average DE value often contain different proportions 
of saccharides.  
1.2. Starch degrading enzymes and their mechanisms  
Four main types of starch -converting enzymes are known: endoamylases, 
exoamylases, debranching enzymes and transferases (van der Maarel et al. 2002 ). The 
enzymes used in this thesis belong to the endo - and exoamylases and will be discussed 
in more detail.  
1.2.1.  Bacillus licheniformis α -amylase (BLA)  
α-Amylases [E.C. 3.2.1.1] are endo -hydrolases that randomly cleave α -(1,4) -
glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides containing three or more α -(1,4) -linked glucose 
units (Dona et al. 2010 ). The term 'alpha' refers to the α -anomeric configuration of the 
liberated sugar and not to the configuration of the hydrolysed linkage. Endo -acting 
bacterial α -amylases produce larger oligosaccharides than their mammalian 
counterparts, mainly because hydrolysis of α -(1,4) linkages close to the non -reducing 
end of the su bstrate is difficult for these enzymes (MacGregor et al. 2001 ). 
α-Amylases commonly require calcium ions to be present during the reaction in 
order to maintain their structural integrity (Machius et al. 1995 ). The three calcium ions 
bound by the Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase (BLA) molecule (Figure 1.2 A), along with 
the calcium ions added to the solution , facilitate the stability of the enzyme, even at 
elevated temperatures (Nazmi et al. 2008 ).  
The part of the protein where substrates, in this case glucose units of starch, 
interact with the enzyme and can undergo a chemical reaction is referred to as the active 
site of the enzyme. The active site of BLA is located in a cleft ( Figure 1.2 B), at the point 
of junction between domain A and B ( Figure 1.2 A; Nagano et al. (2001) ). The subsite 
theory assumes that the active site of an enzyme consists of a number of subsites, each 
able to interact with a monomeric residue of the substrate. Even though each subsite 
interacts with on ly one glucose unit, a multipoint linkage at several binding sites is 
created with the whole oligosaccharide. This linkage allows for a correct arrangement of 
the long molecules of substrate in the active site (Synowiecki 2007 ). The subsites are 
formed by amino acid residues that interact (e.g., form hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic 
Chapter 1  
6 interactions (Hiromi et al. 1973 ) with the glucose units ( Figure 1. 2 B). Theoretically the 
energies of the interactions between the amino acids and the monomers of the substrate 
(the binding energies) can be quantified.  
    
Figure  1.2 The model structure of Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase. (A) The three domains A, B and C of 
BLA are shown along with bound calcium and sodium ions (Muñoz et al. 2011 ) (B) Molecular model of the 
active site of BLA with a bound substrate (DP 8). The red colour indicates the residues of the active site 
(Tran et al. 2014a ).  
The binding energies of the subsites of an enzyme can be displayed in the form of 
a subsite map ( Figure 1. 3). In the subsite map , the cleavage site (the location in which 
the bond between two molecules will be hydrolysed) is located between subsite +1 a nd -
1. Conventionally, subsites located to the right from the cleavage site (aglycone subsites) 
are assigned positive numbers and interact with the reducing end -side of the molecule. 
Subsites to the left (glycone subsites) are given negative numbers and ar e positioned 
towards the non -reducing end of the polymer.

oligosaccharide (DP 9). The reducing end glucose unit is coloured. The arrow indicates where the bond 
cleavage occurs.

Introduction  
7 The binding energy values assigned to the subsites can be both negative and 
positive. The more negative the energy values, the stronger the attraction betwee n the 
subsite and the monomeric residue. Positive binding energies signify a weaker 
interaction, implying  repulsion. A positive binding energy has been assigned to a barrier 
site in subsite map of BLA (subsite +4). The barrier site enforces the often obser ved dual 
specificity of BLA , and without it a more equal distribution of products is observed 
(Kandra et al. 2002 ). Subsites with a high positive energy play a role in positioning the 
substrate in the active site and removing the products after hydrolysis.  
The composition of products after starch hydrolysis depends on the number of 
subsites in the active site and the  binding energy values assigned to these subsites 
(MacGregor et al. 2001 ). BLA contains nine subsites (Kandra et al. 2002 ), but new 
evidence from molecular modelling suggest that another subsite, subsite -6, might be 
present in BLA (Tran et al. 2014b ). According to Kandra et al. (2006)  the values of 
binding energies of BLA subsites depend on the temperature. The authors describe the 
bindi ng of substrates at 80°C as more favourable and stronger than at 50°C.  
Formation of the enzyme -substrate complex allows several possible binding 
modes, of which only those that overlap the catalytic site can become productive. The 
binding mode is productiv e when the glycosidic bond is hydrolysed. If the glucose units 
are bound by other subsites, but do not cover the catalytic site or cover the catalytic site 
but are not hydrolysed, the enzyme -substrate complexes are non -productive. The 
subsite maps of α -amy lases are developed with experiments using short, linear 
substrates. However, enzymes like BLA, which can bind macromolecules, are able to 
bind small molecules in many different ways. There can be numerous non -productive 
bindings between the enzyme and the  substrate s that are not observed in the kinetics.  
Bacillus licheniformis α -amylase (BLA) is commonly used in the industry as a 
liquefying enzyme. BLA is suitable for industrial use, because of its ability to remain 
active for several hours at temperature s over 90°C ( Fitter et al. (20 01), Declerck et al. 
(2003) ). BLA is a stable enzyme. Not only is it active at high temperatures, but it rema ins 
stable at these temperatures for a long time (Fitter et al. 2001 ). The thermostability of 
enzymes is an evolutionary property – the enzymes must be active at their 
physiologically relevant temperature, but lower their catalytic efficiency when 
temperature drastically changes ( Jaenicke (2000) , Arnold et al. (2001) ). The strategies 
Chapter 1  
8 used by en zymes to achieve thermostability are not fully understood, but most likely 
they are not the direct result of the amino acid composition (Jaenicke 2000 ). All weak 
interactions that can contribute to the (thermo)stability of enzymes, e.g., hydrogen 
bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ion and metal binding, are affected by temperature to 
different degrees ( Fontana et al. (1998) , Jaenicke (2000) , Arnold et al.  (2001) ).  
1.2.2.  Glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger  
Glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.3.) belongs to a family of exo -hydrolases. It hydrolyses 
the terminal α -1,4-glycosydic bonds of glucose from the non -reducing ends of amylose 
and amylopectin and releases glucose in b eta-configuration. Unlike most α -amylases, 
glucoamylases can cleave the α -1,6-glycosydic bonds. The hydrolysis rate of the branch 
points is however 30 -50 times slower than that of α -1,4-glycosydic bonds (Dona et al. 
2010 ).  
Aspergillus niger  has been used for commercial production of glucoamylase 
(Pandey 1995 ). Fungal glucoamylases are usually glycoproteins consisting of more than 
one isoform, with the one from A. niger  having two: GA I  and GA II (James and Lee 1997 ). 
The GA I iso form consists of a catalytic site region, a highly glycosylated linker and a 
starch binding domain ( Figure 1.4 A) . A lower molecular weight due to the lack of the 
starch binding domain is what distinguishes the GA II isoform from GA I (Wong 1995 ). 
The active sites of the two enzyme forms do not differ in kinetic properties and subsite 
structure ( Figure 1.4 B ). Even their subsite maps are not significantly different (Ermer et 
al. 1993 ).  
The purpose of the starch binding domain is to anchor the enzyme to the chain of 
the substrate (Juge et al. 2002 ), even though the absence of this domain does not impair 
the activity of glucoamylase towards soluble starch. After the enzyme is attached to the 
substrate, the non -reducing end enters the catalytic domain and hydrolysis can occur. As 
glucose is removed fr om the catalytic site, glucoamylase can dissociate from the 
substrate (James and Lee 1997 ).

Paetzel 2011 ). The glycosylation of the protein by mannose ( top) and NAG oligosaccharides ( on the left ) is 
shown.  
The subsite theory for glucoamylases was described by Hiromi (1970 ; 1973 ). 
Different glucoamylases were assigned a common subsite arrangement: seven subsites 
present in the active si te, with the catalytic site located between subsite -1 and +1. 
Glucoamylases contain only one glycone subsite, subsite -1 (Ermer et al. 1993 ). The 
affinity of the interaction between a glucose unit and a subsite corresponds to the 
decrease in the binding free energy (Ermer et al. 1993 ).  
Glucoamylases are generally more stable at acidic pH and their optimum 
temperatures r ange from 40 -60°C. The optimum experimental conditions of A. niger  
glucoamylase are pH 4.2 -5 and temperature of 60°C ( Crabb and Mitchinson (1997) , 
James and Lee (1997) ). The presence of metal ions is not required for the action of GA. 
Glucoamylases are primarily used to produce high glucose syrups, which can then be 
converted into crystalline dextrose, high fructose syrups or fermented in the production 
of ethanol, amino acids or organic acids (Crabb and Mitchinson 1997 ). 
1.3. Models of starch hydrolysis  
Empirical models are mathematical models that are fitted to the experimental 
data without the support of a chemical, phy sical or biological theory. The models that do 
use an underlying theory are referred to as mechanistic models. Models can be either 
deterministic, where as long as the input remains the same the output will not change, 
or stochastic, where the outcome diff ers with each simulation (van Boekel 2008 ).

Chapter 1  
10 The difficulties in modelling of starch hydrolysis stem from the complexity of 
defining the stru cture of the substrate,  still debated and source dependent, and the 
action modes of enzymes. Predicting the outcomes of star ch hydrolysis is complex, as 
two polymers of different molecular weight distributions and two types of linkages are 
hydrolysed at different rates. The hydrolysis of numerous linear and branched 
substrates occurs simultaneously and the action patterns of pr oducts additionally 
depend on the source and the type of used enzyme.  
Murthy et al. (2011)  describes three approaches to the modelling of starch hydrolysis:  
 empirical modelling of the sugar concentrations by curve fitting to experimental 
data (Paolucci -Jeanjean et al. 2000 ),  
 using differential equations (dynamic models) where reaction rate is described 
with expressions used for enzyme kinetics ( Marc et al. (1983) , Henderson and 
Teague (1988) ),  
 modelling of hydrolysis by describing the  structure of starch and simulation of its 
hydrolysis (mechanistic models; Park an d Rollings (1994) , Marchal et al. (2003) , 
Wojciechowski et al. (2001) , Besselink et al. (2008) ). 
Many models have been developed to describe elements of starch hydrolysis 
reaction. They vary in both the approach used for modelling, and in th e purpose of the 
model. Some models focus on finding the best set of reaction conditions ( Åkerber g et al. 
(2000) , Henderson and Teague (1988) ), others try to predic t the extent of hydrolysis 
(DE), the decrease of substrate concentration or the increase in product concentrations 
during the hydrolysis ( Komolprasert and Ofoli (1991) , Wojciechowski et al. (2001) , 
Paolucci -Jeanjean et al. (2000) , Åkerberg et al. (2000) , Park and Rollings (1995) , Park 
and Rollings (1994) , Murthy et al. (2011) , Besselink et al. (2008) , Marchal et al. (2 003) , 
Bryjak et al. (2000) ). There are models that define starch as a substrate (Murthy et al. 
2011 ), and those that focus on either amylose or amylopectin (Marchal et al. 2003 ) or 
even smaller, well defined oligosaccharides. Many use isolated starch, some follow the 
reaction wi th less purified substrates, e.g., during mashing ( Marc et al. (1983) ,  Koljonen 
et al. (1995) ). Overall models, just as the experimental conditions, differ in: pH, 
temperature, presence or lack of buffers, enzyme dosage, substrate concentration, 
enzyme type and source, starch source etc.  
Introduction  
11 The three ty pes of models described by Murthy et al. (2011)  are used to follow 
elements of liquefaction and saccharification. In each of the categories models can be 
found that aim at: describing the inhibition, the inactivation of enzymes or the enzyme 
activity ( Beschkov et al. (1984) , Zanin and De Moraes (1996) , González -Tello et al. 
(1996) , Cepeda et al. (2001) , Polakovič and Bryjak (2002) , Apar and Ozbek (2004) , 
Bryjak et al. (2004) , Baks et al. (2006) , Brandam et al. (2003) ), the reversed reactions 
(Beschkov et al. (1984) , Zanin and De Moraes (1996) , Nikolov et al. (1989) , Matsuno et 
al. (1978) ), predicting the hydrolysis rate ( González -Tello et al. (1996) , Bryjak et  al. 
(2000) ), the DE ( Hende rson and Teague (1988) ), the conversion of substrate (Rodriguez 
et al. 2006 ), the concentration of selected products ( Rollings and Thompson (1984) , 
Koljonen et al. (1995) , Lee et al. (1992) , MacGregor an d MacGregor (1985) , Nagy et al. 
(1992) , (Vidal et al. 2009 ), Morales et al. (2008) , Bryjak et al. (2000) , Åkerberg et al. 
(2000) , Paolucci -Jeanjean et al. (2000) , Polakovič and Bryjak (2004) , Marchal et al. 
(2003) , Wojciechowski et al. (2001) , van der V een et al. (2005) , Besselink et al. (2008) , 
Murthy et al. (2011) , Nakatani (1996) ),  or kinetic parameters ( Allen and Thoma (1976) , 
Kandra et al. (2002) , Gyémánt et al. (2002) , Hiromi et al. (1983) ).  
It has been hypothesized that t he assumptions of the subsite theory can be used 
to theoretically predict product distribution during the time course of hydrolysis 
(Hiromi et al. 1983 ; Torgerson et al. 1979 ). Subsite mapping is a method to calculate the 
values of apparent binding energies of a substrate to the subsites of enzymes. Subsite 
mapping can be performed by analysing the bond -cleavage frequencies (BCF) of 
maltooligosaccharides of known degree of poly merization (DP) and high purity, often 
labelled with a chromophore. Bond cleavage frequencies are defined as relative rates of 
formation of every hydrolysis product (Kandra et al. 2002 ). To minimize 
transglycosylation and condensation  that can complicate the estima tions, the substrate 
concentration has to be low and the reaction products need to be analysed at the init ial 
reaction time (<10% conversion; Kandra et al. (2006) ). The effect of the label attached to 
the substrate is uncertain and even the authors of the papers investigating the action 
patterns confirm that the labels might interact with the enzymes’ subsites and influence 
the bindin g modes (Ermer et al. 1993 ).  
The subsite maps of enzymes are established, so that they can be used to predict 
the composition of hydrolysis products during the hydrolysis of a particular substrate by 
Chapter 1  
12 a particular enzyme. This has been done by Marchal et al. (2003)  and Besselink et al. 
(2008)  for amylases of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  on potato amylopectin, and Bacillus 
amyloliquefaciens  and Bacillus licheniformis  on wheat starch. The authors did not  
consider how temperature might affect the product composition and focused only on 
small carbohydrates and low concentrations of the substrates. However, Marchal et al. 
(2003)  expected that extending the model towards larger carbohydrates will not be an 
issue, as the mechanistic model allows for predictions outside the experimentally 
evaluated range of data.  
1.4. Intensifications of starch hydrolysis - low water conditions  
In the industry the gelatinization and liquefaction processes take place at 30 -35% 
solids (van der Maarel et al. 2002 ). In a 35 w/w% starch -water mixture, 5 % of the initial 
water concentrations is used for chemical gain (van der Veen et al. 2005 ). That said, 
starch processing in the industry uses around 5 times the minimal required water 
content ( Figure 1.5) . The excess of water is necessary for easier gelatinization and 
mixing (van der Veen et al. 2006 ).   
 
Figure  1.5 A scheme of the mass fl ow of water and dry matter in the current process of starch hydrolysis 
(top ) and in a theoretical process at high dry matter content  (bottom) . Scheme adapted from (van der 
Veen 2005 ). 
The benefits of increasing the dry matter contents during starch processing are 
connected with better use of equipment, lower water consumption and waste 

Introduction  
13 production ( Figure 1.5) , and even energy savings. Condensation and evaporation steps 
can be shortened or even omitted when working in a concentrated system.  
However, intensifying starch processing is not an easy task. When increasing the 
concentration of dry matter, the difficulties begin already at the stage of gelatinization. 
The degree of gelatinization depends on temperature, pressure, starch concentration  
and treatment time (Baks et al. 2008 ). The temperature required for complete 
gelatinization increases with increasing concentration of starch (Baks et al. 2008 ), as 
limited availability of water prevents the granules from swelling. If no mechanical force 
is applied during gelatinization at low moisture content, complete gelatinization cannot 
be reached at temperatu res below 100°C ( Baks et al. (2007) , van der Veen et al. (2006) ).  
The gel atinization and liquefaction process should be separated at low moisture 
contents (van der V een et al. 2006 ). Even thermostable enzymes, which can withstand 
the high processing temperatures, will undergo inactivation when high shear is applied. 
Additionally, the presence of enzymes hinders the gelatinization process (van der Veen 
et al. 2006 ).  
At elevated substrate concentrations the enzyme dosage will always remain the 
limiting factor during hydrolysis. A high enzyme to substrate ratio will decrease the time 
required for hydrolysis, but using high conc entrations of enzymes is not economically 
feasible. One of the advantages of lowering the moisture content is the stabilizing effe ct 
the substrate has on the enzyme (BLA).  
A major issue during the saccharification process is the reversed reaction. At high 
product concentrations glucoamylase starts producing maltose and isomaltose at the 
expense of glucose, which decreases the conver sion degree. The right enzyme dosage, 
temperature and reaction time are crucial to avoid the unwanted reaction products 
(Crabb and Mitchinson 1997 ). As the concentration of glucose increases in the process 
the risk of glucose crystallization also increases, solidifying the contents of the reactor 
and hamp ering mixing. This effect will become more pronounced as the moisture 
content is reduced.  
  
Chapter 1  
14 1.5. Aim of the thesis  
The goal of our research was to extend our insight in the enzymatic liquefaction 
and saccharification of starch by establishing mechanistic models  that allow for 
prediction of all the products present in the reaction mixtures during hydrolysis. Since 
α-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis  and glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger  are 
industrially relevant enzymes in starch processing, we choose these e nzyme to collect 
experimental data and validate the predictions of the model. For this reason, we 
explored the mechanisms of both enzymes, the factors affecting the final product 
composition and the differences between the enzymatic hydrolysis process cond ucted at 
low and at high dry solid contents  and different temperatures .   
1.6. Outline of the thesis  
This thesis describes the enzymatic hydrolysis and kinetic modelling of 
liquefaction and saccharification of wheat starch. In chapter 2  we describe a model 
pred icting the outcome of wheat starch liquefaction by α -amylase from Bacillus 
licheniformis at 50°C. We demonstrate the ability of the model to predict starch 
hydrolysis products considerably larger than the oligosaccharides considered in the 
existing models.  The model in its extended version follows all the products of wheat 
starch hydrolysis by BLA separately and despite the quantitative differences, the 
qualitative predictions are satisfactory. We also show that the difference between the 
experimental and c omputed data might stem from the inaccuracy of the subsite map.  
In chapter 3  and 4 the model from chapter 2 is adapted to find a better 
description of the hydrolysis data at two temperatures (50°C and 80°C), by varying the 
energy values of the subsite map and evaluating the inhibition. We hypothesize that a 
subsite map that is based on the cleavage patterns of linear, short molecules does not 
account for the complexity of hydrolysis of amylopectin. The branched structure of 
amylopectin molecules influences the composition of the hydrolysis products by 
restricting the access to some of th e bonds. The presence of branches creates steric 
obstacles for the enzyme. The used α -amylase has difficulties hydrolysing and 
accommodating α -(1,6) -glycosidic bonds, which imposes on the hydrolysis of the α -
(1,4) -glycosidic bonds located in its proximity.  On this basis, we analyse the subsite 
maps in detail and suggest which of the subsites are crucial when making predictions 
Introduction  
15 about the product composition of starch hydrolysates. On top of that we propose new 
subsite maps that allow a quantitative descripti on of the experimental data.  
In chapter 5  we increase the dry matter content during wheat starch hydrolysis. 
We follow both the liquefaction by BLA and the saccharification process by 
glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger  at low moisture content. The same li quefaction 
model as in chapters 2, 3 and 4 is used to predict all of the products of wheat starch 
hydrolysis at higher dry matter contents (30 -60 w/w%). The liquefaction model also 
creates the substrate matrices representing maltodextrins to be used in the  
saccharification model. The saccharification of liquefacts to glucose is followed with a 
new mechanistic model, also using the assumptions of the subsite theory. The 
saccharification model predicts all of the reaction products using the subsite maps of 
glucoamylase available in literature.  
Finally, chapter 6  contains  the general discussion. We start the chapter by 
demonstrating how the parameters of the liquefaction model at low moisture contents 
were chosen. The outcomes of the model are also compared wi th the experimental data 
at 30 -60 w/w%. Next, we test our liquefaction model with starch hydrolysis data at 5 
and 60 w/w% taken from literature, to verify both the approach we used and the 
validity of the parameters we obtained in chapters 3 and 4. The met hod used to improve 
the subsite maps is also tested on another enzyme, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  α-amylase. 
After discussing the factors that influence saccharification at high dry matter contents, 
we conclude the chapter with describing the potential of stochastic modelling and its 
practical use.

22 Abstract  
A stochastic model of starch hydrolysis was extended to predict the dextrose 
equivalent (DE) and the complete composition of carbohydrates produced by Bacillus 
licheniformis  α-amylase (BLA) during wheat starch hydrolysis. The model can predict all 
the products of the hydrolysis reaction provided a subsite map of the enzyme is 
available. The model’s predictions were compared with experimental data (50°C) 
analysed by using HPLC -SEC. The gradual hydrolysis of starch revealed that BLA does 
not hydrolyse starch in a random manner.  
The absolute values predicted by the model initially are different from the actual 
concentrations of the carbohydrates in the experimental data. Changin g the value of one 
of the subsites improves the fit for the smaller oligosaccharides, but is not enough to 
account for all the differences. However, by being able to make these changes, we show 
that our model can be used not only for predicting carbohydrat e composition, but also 
for verifying the accuracy of experimentally obtained subsite maps.  
  
Describing the full extent of wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA - studies on a stochastic model  
23 2.1. Introduction  
Starch is one of the most abundant polysaccharides in the world. It can be easily 
extracted from plants and used in its native form, but it can also be transformed 
allowing numerous other applications. One of the methods of transforming starch is its 
hydro lysis. Starch is hydrolysed, e.g., in breweries or alcohol distilleries, where the 
produced glucose is fermented to ethanol. Since starch hydrolysis is so commonly used 
on industrial scale, it has been studied extensively and in a variety of manners.  
Seve ral models of starch hydrolysis have already been discussed in the literature. 
Most of them focus on predicting the concentrations of small carbohydrates (with the 
degree of polymerization (DP) of up to 10 glucose units) or the dextrose equivalent (DE). 
Those models, although useful, are unable to characterize the complete hydrolysis 
process.  
The stochastic model of  Besselink et al. (2008)  describes starch hydroly sis by 
predicting both the average dextrose equivalent and the concentrations of small 
carbohydrates (DP < 8) during hydrolysis of wheat starch. This model can be further 
developed to predict the concentrations of all hydrolysis products. The model of 
Besselink et al. (2008)  is based on the subsite theory for depolymerizing enzymes (Allen 
and Thoma 1976 ). The subsite theory provides the information about the affinities of 
the individual ‘docking stations’ in the active center  of the enzyme towards the 
substrate. In this model the subsite affinities are combined with information on the 
structure and ratio of amylose to amylopectin in wheat starch. Monte Carlo simulation is 
then implemented in the synthesis and the hydrolysis of  starch. Besselink et al. (2008)  
fitted their model to the experimental data obtained from  starch  hydrolysis conducted 
with α -amylase derived from Bacillus licheni formis  (BLA).  
In this chapter  we report the results of wheat starch hydrolysis by Bacillus 
licheniformis  α-amylase at 50°C and describe the trends that all the hydrolysis products 
follow over time. The data we collected are then compared with the extended  hydrolysis 
model to predict over time the concentrations of all carbohydrates present during wheat 
starch hydrolysis.

24 2.2. Materials  
Unmodified wheat starch (S5127) was purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (Steinheim, 
Germany). Starch samples contained 13.7 ±  0.2% of moisture, which was taken into 
account while preparing solutions. Bacterial thermostable α -amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) Type 
XII-A from Bacillus licheniformis  was purchased from Sigma (Thermamyl 120®, a 
product of Novozyme Corp.). The enzyme concentration  was expressed as grams of 
enzyme stock solution per 100 grams of total reaction mixture (w/w%). Sodium 
hydroxide (Merck, Germany) and calcium chloride di -hydrate (Merck, Germany) were at 
least analytical grade. MilliQ water was used for preparation of all  the solutions. 
Carbohydrate standards for HPLC calibration (glucose, maltose, maltotriose, 
maltotetraose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose and maltoheptaose, all minimum 90% 
purity) and dextran analytical standards for gel permeation chromatography (5, 12, 25 
and 50 kDa) were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich, Germany.  
2.3. Methods  
2.3.1. Starch hydrolysis  
The method used for gelatinization and enzymatic starch hydrolysis was based 
on the method described by Besselink et al. (2008) . All gelatinization and hydrolysis 
experiments were conducted in a temperature -controlled glass batch reactor (200 ml 
volume). The reactor was filled with a suspension of wheat starch in demineralized 
water (10 w/w%) with 5 mM CaCl 2·2H 2O. This suspension w as heated to 90°C at the 
start of the starch gelatinization process. To ensure that the solution was properly 
mixed, a stainless steel anchor stirrer was used (300 rpm). The pH was not adjusted (pH 
5.6, measured at 50°C), but remained unchanged during the course of the reaction.  
After one hour, the temperature of the gelatinized mixture was lowered to 50°C 
(± 1°C) before the hydrolysis reaction. When the solution reached the desired 
temperature, 0.01 w/w% of α -amylase from Bacillus licheniformis was added and 6 
hours were allowed for hydrolysis. During the reaction hydrolysed starch was pipetted 
into Eppendorf tubes and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen to stop the hydrolysis. 
Samples were stored in a freezer ( -80°C) until further analysis.

25 2.3.2. Determ ination of carbohydrate composition  
The crushed frozen samples (0.3 g) were transferred into a new tube. To increase 
the pH value and to stop the enzyme, 90 µl of 2 M NaOH and 1,110 μl of demineralized 
water were added to each sample. All samples were cent rifuged for 10 minutes at 2,400 
× g and 4°C to separate the undissolved remains. The remaining supernatant was 
filtered using syringes and Minisart single use filters into glass HPLC bottles. The 
carbohydrate composition was measured by using size exclusio n chromatography 
(HPLC -SEC). The Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system was equipped with a Shodex Sugar 
KS-803 column with KS -G guard and a RI -detector. The column was operated at 80°C 
and used MilliQ water as eluent at a flow -rate of 0.3 ml·min-1.  
Table  2.1 Groups of carbohydrates and the retention times used to divide the chromatograms of 
hydrolysed starch samples.  
  
Every chromatogram obtained from the analysed hydrolysis samples was divided 
into 12 groups. Each group contained either a single carbohydrate  (if the peak was 
distinguishable) or a range of carbohydrates ( Table 2.1 ). To calculate the retention times 
at which these groups of sugars were eluting from the column, we calibrated the HPLC 
system. The calibration plot was prepared based on the elution  times of 11 standards of 
known molecular weight ( Mw). Using the equation from the calibration curve and the 
average molecular weight of each group, we estimated elution times. The 
Group content Average M w Retention time

Maltose (DP 2) 342 31.1 - 32.3

the degree of polymerization j (DP j), C0 [g·l-1] is the initial carbohydrate concentration in 
the reaction mixture and Mw,w  is the molar mass of water (18.02 g ·mol-1).  
2.3.3. Model  
For each model simulation a new substrate was built. The substrate consisted of 
around 100,000 glucose units, distributed between amylose (26%) and amylopectin 
(74%). The use of Monte Carlo method provided a variation in the starch structure. The 
positions  of the branches along the amylopectin molecule were randomized in the model 
and based on probability, preventing molecules from being identical in every simulation. 
The subsite map of Kandra et al. (2006)  for BLA was used unchanged, just as the 
inhibition constants (b I = 0.1; b II = 0.2; b III = 0.4) proposed by Marchal et al. (2003) . 
Matlab 2012a (7.14) was u sed to perform all of the simulations.  
A number of modifications was made compared to the model of Besselink et al. 
(2008) . First, the model was extended to quan tify all carbohydrates present in the 
hydrolysed matrix; the carbohydrates with the same numbers of glucose units, both 
branched and linear, were added together using their overall mass fractions  (Xi): 
𝑋𝑖=𝑛𝑖∙(𝑖∙𝑀𝑤,𝑔+𝑀𝑤,𝑤)
𝑚𝑡𝑜𝑡         (2) 
Whe re i is the degree of polymerization of the molecule for which the Xi is 
calculated, ni is the number of moles of i in the matrix, Mw,g is the molar weight of a 
glucose unit (162,14 g·mol-1), Mw,w is the molar weight of water (18,02 g·mol-1) and mtot 
is the total mass of the starch matrix in grams, including the mass of water added after 
each hydrolysis event. The carbohydrates were then grouped based on their degree of 
polymerization into 12 groups corresponding to the groups of the collected 
experim ental data.  
Describing the full extent of wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA - studies on a stochastic model  
27 The second modification enhanced the time resolution (timespan of the model). 
The model by Besselink et al. (2008)  was limited to only 8 time steps of the set timespan 
in order to save computation time and data storage space. We used a larger number of 
time steps: 1001 time steps were stored out of around 3 million discrete hydrolysis 
events. At each of the time steps, all molecules present in the hydrol ysed substrate 
matrix were quantified and stored. This higher resolution ensured a better comparison 
of the model with the experimental results.  
Finally, we changed the fitting procedure in the model. Comparing the model to 
the data required translating t he model time (i.e. discreet hydrolysis events) into 
physical time values. In this model the physical time was calculated by fitting the 
modelled DE values to the experimental DE. Besselink et al. (2008)  used only the linear 
part of the curve of their experimental DE data to fit the model DE to the corresponding 
experimental values. We decided that it was more accurate to use all the data points 
from the experiment s for the fitting. Each model simulation was performed five times 
and then averaged, before the fitting procedure took place. We always used the full set of 
the experimental DE values for the non -linear fitting of the model DE. The experimental 
DE values w ere calculated from the mass fractions of the oligosaccharides (DP 1 -6) as 
described by Baks et al. (2007) , while the DE values from the model were calculated as 
described by Besselink et al. (2008) .  
2.4. Results and Discussion  
2.4.1. Starch hydrolysis  
The chromatograms of all carbohydrates as shown in Figure 2.1  depict different 
stages of enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat starch by Bacillus licheniformis α -amylase 
(BLA) at 50°C. The five chromatogram s present the progress of starch hydrolysis after 0, 
15, 60, 90, 180 and 360 minutes. A clear order in which the starch molecules were 
hydrolysed can be observed. In the beginning of the hydrolysis, just after the enzyme 
was added (time 0), hardly any carb ohydrates present in the sample were smaller than 
DP 150 (below M w of 25,000). The measurements correspond with the sizes known for 
wheat amylose (number -average DP of around 1200, spread over a wider range of DP 
200-3,000 (Hanashiro and Takeda 1998 )) and amylopectin (mole cular weight in the 
range of 107 (Manners 1989 )). It is not possible to distinguish between amylose and 
Chapter 2   
28 amylopectin molecules in this type of analysis. The first peak at time 0 (retention time 
16-19 minutes) represents the largest and the entangled soluble molecules that elute 
the fastest. Based on the observat ions of Park and Rollings (1994)  these molecules 
correspond to high molecular w eight amylopectin. The tall peak at time 0 (retention 
time 21 minutes) contained carbohydrates with apparent M w of 40,000 to more than 
100,000, built from roughly 200 to 650 glucose units based on the calibration.  
 
Figure 2.1. The chromatograms of wheat starch samples hydrolysed by BLA (50°C) at six different times t 
[minutes] during the reaction. The dotted plot represents the logarithm of molecular weight at the 
indicated retention times.   
Hydrolysis of starch by α -amylases i s not entirely random and the product 
distribution can be, at least partially, explained based on the highly ordered structure of 
amylopectin and the structure of the enzyme. The high molecular weight amylopectin 
(peak below the RT of 20 minutes) was degra ded during the reaction’s first 15 minutes 
and simultaneously the concentrations of all molecules larger than maltotetraose (DP4) 
started to increase. The majority of the products after the first 15 minutes of reaction 
were within the range of the large mo lecules (DP 250 -900, average apparent M w of 
70,000), as a result of the attack of the enzyme on the accessible linear fragments of high 
molecular weight amylopectin. The α -amylase has a higher affinity for these linear 
fragments because they are more expos ed (Park and Rollings 1994 ). The products of 
hydrolysis of the high molecular weight amylopect in will then be groups of clusters 
(domains) or single clusters. Simultaneously with amylopectin also amylose molecules 

Describing the full extent of wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA - studies on a stochastic model  
29 were digested. At this early stage of the reaction (15 min), the hydrolysis of amylose can 
be the source of the intermediate size carboh ydrates (DP 40 -150), since the molecular 
weight of amylose rapidly shifts to lower values due to the more random endo -action of 
α-amylase.  
Despite the higher affinity of the enzyme for amylopectin, the rate of hydrolysis 
of amylose is overall higher (Park et al. 1988 ). This difference in the hydrolysis rate is a 
result of two factors, the first being the simpler structure of amylose, with less 
branching. Branch points and clusters of branches slow down the initially h igh reaction 
rate of amylopectin hydrolysis. The second factor is the different spatial conformation of 
the two polymers in solution. Park and Rollings (1994)  reported that, at least in water -
DMSO solutions, amylose conformation is that of a helix, whereas amylopectin forms a 
random coil. The enzyme can bind the exposed fragments of the more flexible 
amylopectin molecules easier, than the rigid amylose molecules. This leads to the higher 
preference of the enzyme towards hydrolysis of amylopectin. Additionally, the affinity of 
the enzyme for linear regions of amylopectin is based not s o much on the structure of 
the polymer, but rather on the structure of the enzyme itself (Bertoft 2013 ). The 
reaction proceeded faster when all subsites of an enzyme are filled with glucose 
residues, which happens easier in the longer, linear regions of amylopectin.  
Our observations for wheat starch and BLA are in line with those  of Park and 
Rollings (1994) , who observed chromatograms similar to ours after analysing a 50 -50% 
mixture of isolated amylose and amylopectin degraded by BLA. Their figures presented 
a wide, tailing peak at the beginning of the reaction followed by a tall heading peak few 
minutes later. In the hydrolysis of waxy maize amylopectin by Bacillus subtilis α -
amylase similar stages of hydrolysis were observed (Bertoft 1986 ).  
In the following stages of the reaction, up until the 180th minute hydrolysis time, 
the enzymatic attack was mostly directed at the carbohydrates comprising the largest 
peak (at 21 minutes retention time). While the amount of these large carbohydrates 
continued to decrease, a group of intermediate size (shoulder a t 22 -23 minute) started 
to appear. An attack on the linear segments of amylopectin would quickly reduce the 
size of the molecules and produce smaller units - a cluster domain or a cluster.  
Two main theories about the amylopectin structure are being debated  in 
literature, the traditional cluster model (Hizukuri 1986 ) and the building block and the 
Chapter 2   
30 backbone concept (Bertoft 2013 ). These theories, along with the research on chain 
length distributions of amylopectin enable estimating the sizes of clusters.  
 
Figure  2.2. Structure of amylopectin fragments according to two models described in literature. (a) 
Traditional model with clusters. Three clusters are shown along with two possible points of the initial 
enzymatic attack (arrows). The sizes of the clusters are between DP of 220 and 270. A chains are 
presented in white, an exemplary B1 , B2 and B3  chain s and the C chain are indicated. The reducing end is 
shown in dark grey on the right -hand side of the figure. (b) Model described by Bertoft (2013) . Only one 
cluster is shown (DP of 243 or 260, depending on the point of hydrolysis). A chains are shown in white, 
the first glucose unit of each branch is depicted in grey a nd the reducing end is shown in dark grey on the 
right -hand side of the figure. The IB are the inter -block segments, the double -arrows point out the inter -
cluster (IC) segments. The small arrows show the possible point of enzymatic attack.  
Cluster model.  Based on the traditional model ( Figure 2.2 A), Takeda and 
Hanashiro (2003)  found that wheat amylopectin clusters contain on avera ge 13 chains. 
The short chains (A and B1) build up the clusters, whereas the long chains (B2 and B3) 
connect them. When combining the information on the length of the isolated side chains 
of wheat amylopectin, the amount of A chains per B1 chain, and the m ol% of the A, B and 
C chains ( Hanashiro et al. (2002) ; Hizukuri and Maehara (1990) ) one can calculate the 
size of a cluster. Based on this literature data, an average cluster in terms of degree of 
polymerization would be equal to approximately 240 glucose un its (M w of ~40,000). 
When taking into account the data collected by Hanashiro et al. (1996) , a cluster of 13 
chains would contain around 320 glucose units (M w around 53,000). Of course, values 
chosen here are average and only used as an approximati on. The produced clusters vary 

Describing the full extent of wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA - studies on a stochastic model  
31 in size, depending on the number of chains present per isolated cluster and the length of 
the chains.  
Backbone model.  In the second model, the amylopectin unit corresponding to a 
cluster in the traditional model has a differ ent structure ( Figure 2.2 B). The model 
described by Bertoft (2 013)  involves a backbone with small, branched units named 
building blocks. The building blocks are the smallest units of amylopectin (contrary to 
the clusters in the traditional model) that can be isolated from ‘clusters’ by extensive 
hydrolysis. For ce reals, Bertoft and co -workers describe large clusters (on average 12 
chains per cluster), with fewer long chains and a higher proportion of small chains, 
containing six to eight building blocks that are within a short distance from each other. 
The building  blocks are occasionally separated by longer segments between the blocks – 
inter -cluster segments of more than nine glucose residues. These segments are thought 
to be the parts of the amylopectin molecule attacked first by the α -amylase to release the 
‘clusters’. We can make an estimation of the size of an exemplary cluster, based on the 
assumptions of Bertoft (2013)  and the side -chain lengths following Hanashiro et al. 
(1996) . Depending on the point of cleavage (e.g. indicated by one of the two arrows in 
Figure 2.2  B) and the number and lengths of side -chai ns, an average cluster could have 
the DP in the range from 240 (M w ~39,000) to 260 (M w ~42,000).  
Regardless of the theory used and the average literature values of chain lengths, 
we arrive at the same explanation – the peak at roughly 23 minutes constitut es the 
clusters that are slowly degraded in the next stages of hydrolysis. This means that both 
of the models can be used to explain the hydrolysis profiles we obtained, therefore we 
do not exclude either of them.  
The preference of the enzyme for the longer fragments of amylopectin not 
carrying branches, explains why the molecules constituting the tall peak (21 min) are 
being degraded rather slowly and through molecules that form the wider peak at 22 -23 
minutes (mol ecular weight ~25,000 to 50,000; DP ~150 -300). The glycosidic bonds 
located outside of clusters, are easier accessible to the enzyme and are cleaved first. 
Therefore, in the first, most rapid stage of hydrolysis the domains containing various 
numbers of cl usters are produced. That stage is followed by still quite fast hydrolysis of 
the domains into isolated clusters. After the clusters are separated, the bonds within the 
cluster become the main target of the enzyme. That reaction progresses slowly because 
Chapter 2   
32 of the more spatial structure of the cluster, formed by the large number of branches. The 
linkages between the glucose molecules inside the cluster are less accessible than in the 
regions linking clusters. The structure of the substrate and the preference o f the enzyme 
explain why the hydrolysis of amylopectin into clusters is a faster process than cleaving 
the shorter chains within the clusters (Bertoft 2013 ; Nielsen et al. 2008 ). Therefore, the 
hydrolysis of bonds in amylopectin cannot be described as entirely r andom.  
The distribution of the smaller hydrolysis products throughout the hydrolysis is 
not entirely random either. Our data show clearly that the concentrations of 
carbohydrates of intermediate sizes (approximately DP 40 – 150 eluting between 24 and 
27 m inutes) remain at a steady level – they do not increase or decrease from 30th to 
180-240th minute. We expect that this is the result of the non -random hydrolysis based 
on the structure of amylopectin clusters. The oligosaccharides are initially the product  of 
the hydrolysis of amylose and the easier accessible outer chains of the clusters (Bertoft 
1986 ). Eventually, also the inner chains of amylopectin clusters are degraded into 
oligosaccharides. The large enzyme molecules cannot easily penetrate the highly 
branched regions of clusters, this explains the lower r ate of hydrolysis of the chains 
inside the highly branched clusters ( Park and Roll ings (1994) ; Park et al. (1988) ). Based 
on the average chain lengths of the A and B chains of amylopectin, one can then expect 
more carbohydrates of smaller sizes, shorter than the A and B chains. Sin ce the rate of 
hydrolysis of the α -1,6 bonds by BLA is low, the A and B chains will only be hydrolysed a 
few bonds away from the branch point. The clear pattern in the proportions of the 
oligosaccharides is a result of the characteristics of the enzyme (i. e. subsite map).  
When the reaction reached 180 minutes, nearly all carbohydrates larger than DP 
300 were digested. From that moment on only the concentrations of carbohydrates with 
around 16 or less glucose units continued to increase. With the largest mol ecules gone, 
the intermediate size carbohydrates of DP 30 to 300 were slowly hydrolysed. The slow 
hydrolysis of these molecules might suggest they are the branched remains that are left 
after cutting of the side -chains (A and B chains) of the clusters.  
2.4.2. Model development  
The model designed by Besselink et al. (2008)  was used to predict the 
concentrations of the small carbohydrates (DP 1 -7) and the dextrose equivalent over 
time. During the development of that model, the authors decided to focus on only small 
Describing the full extent of wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA - studies on a stochastic model  
33 carbohydrates for two reasons. First, running the model for all carbohydrates was 
computationally intensive and second, because they did not analyse the larger 
carbohydrates in their experiments. Due to increase in computational power available, 
the first was no longer a limitation, and thus we focused on the latter.  
The model of Besselink et al. (2008)  could be used to perform the calculations for 
carbohydrates of all sizes, predict their concentrations and even distinguish between the 
branched and the linear carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the currently available methods 
of analysis of starch do not provi de such detailed separation. The methods that have a 
resolution of 1 glucose unit fail to analyse molecules larger than DP of 40 -50 (e.g., 
capillary electrophoresis). Other methods, which can analyse the whole range of 
molecular weights, such as the HPSEC chosen here, struggle with lower resolution.  
To partially compensate for the poor resolution of HPSEC the measured 
carbohydrates were divided into groups ( Table 2.1 ). These groups are based on the 
shapes and trends in the chromatograms. The smallest carbo hydrates (DP 1 -4) were 
considered individually, while the larger ones were grouped together based on the 
retention times from the calibration. The groups were given strict DP borders, but one 
should bear in mind that this is only an approximation, especial ly for the larger 
carbohydrates.  
The hydrolysis experiments were repeated four times. The differences between 
the four data sets and the model were minor (an average square root of the residual sum 
of squares (SRSS) of 639.5 with a 0.25% difference betwee n the highest and the lowest 
SRSS value), therefore we randomly chose to depict only one of the experimental data 
sets in the graphs of this chapter . 
After applying all of the initial modifications to the model, the first new version of 
the model was used to make predictions for one of the experimental data sets ( Figure 
2.3) using the same initial values of parameters as Besselink et al. (2008) . As presented 
in Figure 2.3  A the fit of the modelled DE to the DE calculated from the experimental 
data is good; better than that of Besselink et al. (2008) . This better fit is the result of 
lower DE values in our results (less extensive hydrolysis, resulting in lower 
concentrations of the oligosaccharides) and a more accurate fitting procedure.

(black squares/solid line), 181 -350 (red triangles/dashed line), 351 -450 (blue dot s/dotted line) and 451 -
700 (green diamonds/dash -dot line).  
Despite the good fit of the DE, the predictions of the concentrations of 
carbohydrate groups were less accurate. The shapes of the curves representing the 
model showed qualitative similarities to t he trends in the experimental data, but the 
actual values of concentrations were either over - or underestimated. A clear example 
was maltotriose, for which after 360 minutes of hydrolysis the model predicted a 
concentration of nearly 25 w/w%, which was hig her by 10 w/w% than in the 
experimental data.  
The model also overestimated the production of molecules belonging to the 
groups DP 9 -15, DP 16 -35, DP 36 -80 ( Figure 2.3  C) and DP 81 -180 ( Figure 2.3  D). In the 

Describing the full extent of wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA - studies on a stochastic model  
35 beginning of the hydrolysis, the concentrations of these groups increased too rapidly, 
which would suggest that the hydrolysis in the model was not as restricted as in the 
actual reaction. Simultaneously the largest molecules in the model ( Figure 2.3  D) were 
hydrolysed too fast. The concentrations of gr oups DP 351 -450 and DP 451 -700 were not 
only largely underestimated in the model, but their values also declined too rapidly. 
Similarly, groups DP 81 -180 and DP 181 -350 of the model were also hydrolysed too fast. 
In the experiments these groups were steadi ly hydrolysed over the whole duration of 
the reaction, whereas in the model they were no longer present after 120 (DP 181 -350) 
or 240 minutes (DP 81 -180). The fast hydrolysis of the largest molecules ( Figure 2.3  D) 
lead to overestimating the concentrations  of molecules of intermediate size ( Figure 2.3  
C). Thus, the model might not have had enough constraints set for the enzyme, and lack 
of those boundaries allowed for all the bonds to quickly be cleaved.  
2.4.3. Subsite map changes  
One of the causes of the i naccuracies in the predictions may be the assumed 
values of the subsite map. The differences in the binding energy of the subsites within a 
subsite map of an enzyme are responsible for the slightly different product distributions 
after enzymatic starch hyd rolysis (Macgregor et al. 1994 ). Besselink et al. (2008)  already 
pointed out that the subsite  map developed by Kandra et al. (2006)  had its 
shortc omings.  
First, the enzyme can interact differently with the substrate used to create the 
subsite map than it would with the starch molecules. The presence of an aromatic ring 
(2-chloro -4-nitrophenyl) at the end of the substrate -analogue molecules could hav e 
influenced the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate. The pNPG aromatic 
ring can act as a glucose unit and thus interacts with the subsites of the enzyme. It was 
indeed shown to interact more favourably with some subsites, and less favourably with 
others (Macgregor et al. 1994 ).  
Second, the analogue molecules Kandra et al. (2006)  used were much smaller 
than a true starch molecule. Using linear maltodecaose, an analogue which does not 
reflect the complex structure of starch amyl opectin, could have been overly simplistic 
and might have caused the calculated energy values to differ from the actual energy 
values for starch. Differences in the values of binding energies can cause significant 
discrepancies when they are used for predi cting the yields of starch hydrolysis products.  
Chapter 2   
36 Besselink et al. (2008)  already observed that the model seemed to under - or 
overestimate the production of certain small carbohydrates. A change in the energy 
value of the subsite map (subsite +3 was changed from -5.8 to 0 kJ·mol-1) resulted in an 
improved fit of the model. To ve rify the findings of Besselink et al. (2008)  we also 
changed the value of subsite +3 to 0 kJ·mol-1 (Figure 2.4 ).  
 
Figure  2.4 The model representing starch hydrol ysis in time (lines) fitted to the experimental values 
(points). The value of subsite +3 was changed to 0 kJ·mol -1 in the model. ( A) Dextrose equivalent; ( B) 
Glucose (black squares/solid line), maltose (red triangles/dashed line), maltotriose (blue dots/do tted

(red triangles/dashed line), 351 -450 (blue dots/dotted line) and 451 -700 (green diamonds/dash -dot 
line).  
As a result of removing the influence of subsite +3, the fit of maltotriose and 
glucose generally i mproved ( Figure 2.4  B), however the predictions for other 
carbohydrate groups remained the same or deviated even more from experiments as 
compared with the original model. The predicted concentration of e.g. maltose ( Figure 

Describing the full extent of wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA - studies on a stochastic model  
37 2.4 B) increased nearly three -fold, and was almost two times higher than in our 
experiments. The change in the value of subsite +3 did not influence maltotetraose, but 
caused some deviation in the DP 5 -8 group. The remaining groups of carbohydrates 
seemed to have been barely influenced b y the change made to the subsite map.  
When Besselink et al. (2008)  changed the energy of subsite +3 to 0 they showed 
an improvement in the fit for glucose and DP 2, 3 and 5, as well as for the DE. The same 
action in our case improved the fit for only glucose and maltotriose. Our experimental 
anal yses showed slightly different concentrations of carbohydrates compared to those 
found by Besselink et al. (2008) . This discrepancy was most probably caused by th e 
differences in the analysis method (e.g., different HPLC column).  
Table  2.2 The residuals (SRSS) calculated for the model with unchanged subsite map and the model with 
the value of subsite +3 changed in the subsite map.  
  
Aside from the visual comparison of model and data, we used the residuals to put 
a value on how the changes in the model affect the predictions. These residuals were 
calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of residuals (SRSS) per group of 
carbohydrates and as a tota l for each model version ( Table 2.2 ). Small differences in the 
residuals between the two versions of the model can be the effect of the Monte Carlo 
method that introduces randomness into both the synthesis and the hydrolysis in the 
model. That is especiall y true for the high molecular weight molecules, where a variation

38 within around 15% is normal. It thus seems that the concentrations of the large 
molecules are less dependent on the interactions within the catalytic site. More 
pronounced differences, such as for maltotriose and DP 5 -8, are the effect of the change 
made to the subsite +3. Comparing the values of the residuals per group makes it easier 
to draw conclusions about the improvement of the fit, since some groups show clear 
improvement of the fit, w hile the fit of other groups  become s less accurate. Overall, the 
values of the SRSS confirm what can be observed in the plots of data versus the model 
when the value of subsite +3 is changed to 0: the improvement of fit for glucose and 
maltotriose, and the  decline of fit for maltotetraose and DP 5 -8.  
Analysing the values of the individual subsites might bring more insight on how 
the energy values of subsite maps influence the hydrolysis products. Small changes 
made to the values of the subsite map in our m odel might show how detailed the 
calculations of subsite energy should be. Changing the values of subsite map to 0, might 
on the other hand help in confirming the theoretical deliberations about which groups of 
carbohydrates will be affected by a particula r subsite. With a model like ours, where the 
subsite map values are used for making predictions about carbohydrate concentrations, 
a subsite map can be tested for its sensitivity and accuracy.  
2.5. Conclusions  
The products of wheat starch hydrolysis by Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase at 
50°C show a pattern. This proves the enzyme does not attack the starch molecules 
randomly. This pattern can be explained based on the theories describing the structure 
of amylopectin and the subsite theory. The conclusio ns from our experiments can be 
used to further improve the structure of the substrate in the model.  
An extended version of the model as proposed by Besselink et al. (2008) , 
describes the hydrolysis of starch (both amylopectin and amylose) as a function of time. 
In contrast to these authors, we include not only the small oligosaccharides, but nearly 
all carbohydrates present in the reaction.  
While the comparison of experimental values with the original model shows an 
acceptable fit, there is still a discrepancy: larger carbohydrates hydrolyse too fast, while 
smaller ones accumulate too fast. This may be due to inaccurate values of the subsite 
map. We showed that a ch ange of the subsites will specifically modify the formation of 
Describing the full extent of wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA - studies on a stochastic model  
39 smaller carbohydrates, but did not yet explain the faster hydrolysis of the larger chains. 
Therefore, the model still needs to be adapted in different ways to make the prediction 
of the hydroly sis of the larg er carbohydrates more accurate.

44 Abstract  
All of the starch hydrolysis products can be predicted using a stochastic model 
provided the subsite map of the enzyme used for hydrolysis is known. A subsite map 
reported in  literature for Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase at 50°C was tested in the 
model, resulting in a poor fit between the model and the experimental data. Therefore, 
the apparent binding energy values of each subsite in the subsite map were varied. The 
effect of these changes on the composition of the hydrolysis products was reported, 
along with a proposal of a new subsite map. The changes in the subsite map merely 
influenced the formation of the small oligosaccharides (DP 1 -8). The predictions of the 
larger pr oducts also needed adjustments, therefore we investigated another element of 
the model – the inhibition. Our analyses show that rather high inhibition is necessary at 
50°C to slow down the reaction in the model enough to reflect the experimental data. 
With  a simple model we are able to near quantitatively predict the composition of wheat 
starch hydrolysis products.  
  
An improved stochastic model for predictions of enzymatic starch hydrolysis  
45 3.1. Introduction  
During enzymatic starch hydrolysis a complex mixture of products is being 
formed, which has a profound influence on the ultimate product. Modelling of the 
hydrolysis process can be helpful in anticipating the product composition and can even 
replace a cost ly empirical analysis. With polymers like starch, describing the hydrolysis 
reaction using merely a simple Michaelis -Menten equation is not sufficient. Detailed 
modelling becomes possible when the mechanism of the catalysis and the action pattern 
of the en zyme are known. If a subsite map, which is a characteristic trait of an enzyme, is 
known, hydrolysis products of a particular enzyme can be predicted ( Suganuma et al. 
(1978) , Torgerson et al. (1979) , Kondo et al. (1980) ).  
Most of the available models describing starch hydrolysis focus only on a fraction 
of the hydrolysis products ( Presečki et al. (2013) , Murthy et al. (2011) , Besselink et al. 
(2008) , Marchal et al. (2003) , Wojciechowski et al. (2001) , Åkerberg et al. (2000) , 
Paol ucci -Jeanjean et al. (2000) , Torgerson et al. (1979) ). To our knowledge the only 
model that simultaneously studies all the separate products and substrates of the starch 
hydrolysis reaction and predicts the complete product composition  and dextrose 
equivalent (DE) of starch liquefied by Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase (BLA) over time, 
is that described in chapter 2.  
The predictions of that model did not yet provide satisfactory results for neither 
the small, nor the large carbohydrate s. The concentrations of the individual groups of 
carbohydrates were predicted qualitatively, but not quantitatively (chapter 2). The 
largest products were predicted to be hydrolysed much faster than was seen in the 
experiments.  
The differences in the con centrations of glucose and the oligosaccharides were 
most likely influenced by the energy values in the subsite map that was used. This 
subsite map (Kandra et al. 2006 ) was developed using only small substrate analogues 
(DP 10) and thus its use for starch is in fact an extrapolation. We expect th at the subsite 
map containing nine subsites will especially influence the concentrations of molecules 
that contain up to five glucose units.  
On the other hand, the fast disappearance of larger molecules led us to believe 
that additional inhibition or cons traints are needed in the model to slow down this rapid 
hydrolysis. What is more, we could not exclude the possibility that the discrepancies in 
Chapter 3   
46 the concentrations of the largest molecules might be attributed to the structure and 
chain length distribution (CLD) of the substrate that was used in the model.  
In this chapter we investigate the different elements constituting the model for a 
better description of the experimental data by the extended model of starch hydrolysis. 
Our aim was to develop a new subs ite map, based on the hydrolysis of starch, instead of 
the hydrolysis of substrate analogues that have relatively low molecular weight. We also 
investigated the influence of the inhibition caused by the proximity of a branch in 
amylopectin molecules. The i nhibition caused by a branch point occurs when the model 
chooses a glucose unit joined by an α -1,6-glycosidic bond or a glucose unit in close 
proximity of a branch point. The search for the best fitting subsite map was coupled with 
the description of the e ffect of inhibition in the model on the products of the reaction 
and the rate of their hydrolysis.  
3.2. Materials  
Unmodified wheat starch (S5127) with 13.68 ± 0.24% of moisture was purchased 
from Sigma -Aldrich (Steinheim , Germany). Bacterial thermostable α -amylase (EC 
3.2.1.1) Type XII -A from Bacillus licheniformis  was purchased from Sigma (Thermamyl 
120®, a product of Novozyme Corp.). Sodium hydroxide and calcium chloride di -hydrate 
(Merck, Germany) were at least analyti cal grade. MilliQ water was used for preparation 
of all the solutions. Carbohydrate standards for HPLC calibration (glucose, maltose, 
maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose and maltoheptaose, all 
minimum 90% purity) and dextran analytical standards for gel permeation 
chromatography (5, 12, 25 and 50 kDa) were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich, Germany.  
3.3. Methods  
3.3.1. Starch hydrolysis  
The method used for gelatinization and enzymatic starch hydrolysis was as 
described in chapter 2. A glass batch reactor (200 ml volume) was filled with a 
suspension of wheat starch in demineralized water (10 w/w%) with 5 mM CaCl 2·2H 2O. 
The suspension was heated to 90°C and mixed (300 rpm) to gelatinize the starch. After 
one hour, the temperature of the gelatin ized mixture was lowered to 50°C (± 1°C) and 
0.01 w/w% of α -amylase from Bacillus licheniformis  was added. During the reaction, 1.5 
An improved stochastic model for predictions of enzymatic starch hydrolysis  
47 ml samples of hydrolysed starch mixture were pipetted into Eppendorf tubes and 
directly frozen in liquid nitrogen to stop th e hydrolysis.  
3.3.2. Determination of the carbohydrate composition  
To 0.3 g of the frozen starch samples, 90 µl of 2 M NaOH and 1,110 μl of 
demineralized water were added. The samples were then dissolved and centrifuged for 
10 minutes at 2,400 g and 4°C a nd the remaining supernatant was filtered using 
syringes and Minisart single use filters.  
The carbohydrate composition was analysed by using size exclusion 
chromatography (HPLC -SEC). A Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system was equipped with 
a Shodex Sugar KS -803 column with KS -G guard and an RI -detector. The column was 
operated at 80°C and used MilliQ water as eluent at a flow -rate of 0.3 ml· min-1.  
Using the equation from the calibration curve prepared with standards of known 
molecular weight and the average mo lecular weight of each group of carbohydrates, we 
estimated the elution times. The mass fractions of the carbohydrates were calculated as 
described in  chapter 2.    
The hydrolysis experiments were performed four times and the resulting data 
were compared wi th the model. We randomly chose one set of data for all of the 
analyses in this chapter, as the differences between the data sets were small and 
insignificant (data not shown).  
3.3.3. Model  
The model was used with the earlier described adaptations (chapte r 2). For each 
model simulation a new substrate matrix was built. The experimental DE values were 
calculated from the mass fractions of the small carbohydrates (DP 1 -6) as described by 
Baks et al. (2007) , while the DE values from the model were calculated as described by 
Besselink et al. (2008) . All presented model outputs were the average values based on 
five repetitions with the same set of parameters. Matlab 2012a (7.14) was used to 
perform all simulations.  
Two inherent parts of the model were analysed in detail: the  subsite map and the 
inhibition.  
 
Chapter 3   
48 3.3.3.1.   Improvement of the subsite map  
The subsite theory used in the model describes the catalytic site of amylases as 
composed of several subsites, each interacting with one glucose residue of the substrate. 
The energy of the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate at each site can be 
quantified ( Hiromi (1970) , Thoma et al. (1970) , Kandra et al. (2006) ) and used to follow 
the hyd rolysis of the substrate into various products over time ( Allen and Thoma 
(1976) , Suganuma et al. (1978) ).  
In our model the subsite map is used for calculating the association constants 
(Kr,n) for each binding mode of the enzyme -substrate complex ( Figure 3.1 ), both 
productive (resulting in bond cleavage) and non -productive (not resulting in bond 
cleavage). The association constant for a particular complex is based on the sum of the 
binding energies of the subsites occupied by the substrate. The chance  of hydrolysis ( p) 
is equal to 1 when the sum of the binding energies has the lowest possible value, 
resulting in the highest value of the association constant ( Kmax). For more details about 
the model we refer to Besselink et al. (2008) .  
During the simulations the energy values of each subsite were first changed to 0, 
thereby removing the effect of the subsite completely. This change demonstrated which 
subsites aff ected the predicted concentrations of which carbohydrates. The energies 
assigned to the subsites were also varied within a specific range, to simplify determining 
of the apparent binding energy of each subsite. The relative quality of the fit between the 
prediction and the experiment was quantified using the square root of the sum of 
squares (SRSS) of the differences between the model and data.

3.3.3.2.   Improvement of the model inhibition  
In the discussed model inhibition is based on the inability of the enzyme to 
hydrolyse α -1,6-glycosidic bonds (branch points), which makes the α -1,4-glycosidic

50 bonds around these branch points less accessible for the enzymes to hydrolyse. If the 
model choo ses a glucose unit that is affected by the proximity of an α -1,6-glycosidic 
bond, the chance of hydrolysis ( p) of that unit’s α -1,4 bond is multiplied by (1−𝑘𝑏𝑟_𝑖𝑛). 
The inhibition factor (𝑘𝑏𝑟_𝑖𝑛) is calculated with the following equation:  
𝑘𝑏𝑟_𝑖𝑛=2−𝑒𝑏𝑇𝑦 
with bT a branch factor that indicates the type of inhibition (location of the bond to be 
cleaved in the starch molecule relative to the br anch point, as shown in Figure 3.1 ) and y 
is the number of glucose units between the cleavage site and  the branch point (Marchal 
et al. 2003 ). The equation  describes the decrease of the inhibition as the distance from 
the branch point increases. An inhibition factor (kbr_in) of 0 or below 0 is equivalent to no 
inhibition, whereas a value of 1 would indicate complete inhibition and impossibility of 
hydrolysis  (Marchal et al. 2003 ).  
Marchal et al. (2003)  introduced three branch factors bI, bII and bIII, each 
corresponding to an α -1,4-bonds located in a di fferent position with  respect to the 
branch point (Figure 3.1). When the substrate is bound by the enzyme, the α -1,6 linked 
glucose unit can be located either on the non -reducing end side ( bIII) or on the reducing 
end side of the catalytic site (‘before’ o r ‘after’ the cleavage site). If the latter is true, the 
enzymatic attack can take place either at the chain containing the α -1,4,6 -linked glucose 
unit ( bII) or at the chain with the α -1,6-linked glucose unit ( bI) – the branch. Besselink et 
al. (2008)  used the values 𝑏𝐼=0.1, 𝑏𝐼𝐼=0.2 and 𝑏𝐼𝐼𝐼=0.4, which influenced the 
hydrolysis only when the branch point was less than 6, 3 and 1 g lucose units away from 
the cleavage site, respectively. To demonstrate to what extent the predictions are 
affected by this type of inhibition, the inhibition was either removed from the model or 
stronger as compared to the original values chosen by Besselink et al. (2008)  and 
Marchal et al. (2003) . 
3.4. Results and discussion  
3.4.1. Inhibition  
The inhibition around branches was implemented in the model of Besselink et al. 
(2008) , although its accuracy was not tested or discussed by the authors. We first used 
the same set of branch factors (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4) as Besselink et al. (2008)  and Marchal et 
al. (2003) . Figure 3.2  A-D show s that the model qualitatively resembled the trends of the 
An improved stochastic model for predictions of enzymatic starch hydrolysis  
51 experimental data, but there was considerable quantitative discrepancy, as is also 
indicated by the large square root of the residual sum of squares (SRSS = 652).  
We verified the extent of the influence of the branch factors (𝑏𝑇) on the 
predictions of our model by removing the inhibition completely from the model or by 
changing the values of all inhibition factors to 0.1.  
Removing the inhibition from the model resu lted in a worse prediction of the 
concentrations of all groups of carbohydrates above DP 8 ( Figure 3.2  E-H). Thus the 
inhibition mostly influences the hydrolysis rate of the larger starch molecules and has 
less effect on the concentrations of the mono -, di- and oligosaccharides (DP 1 -8). 
Removal of the inhibition leads to the largest polysaccharides ( Figure 3.2 H ) being 
entirely hydrolysed within 90 minutes of the modelled reaction. The products of the 
intermediate size ( Figure 3.2 G , except for DP 5 -8) are  then overestimated by nearly a 
factor of three at the early stages, and follow a different trend than the experimental 
data do. DP 1 -4 are almost unaffected by the removal of inhibition, while DP 5 -8 are only 
moderately influenced, mostly because of the c hange in concentrations of DP 6 -8. These 
observations confirm that without any inhibition, the model cannot predict the 
experimental results correctly.  
Changing the values of all the branch factors to 0.1 improves the predictions 
(Figure 3.2 I -L), with a significant decrease of the total SRSS from 652 (for the original 
set of factors ) to 542. The lower value of the branch factors implies inhibition over 
larger distances from a branch point. With a 𝑏𝑇 value of 0.1, glucose units up to 6 bonds 
away from th e branch point were affected by the inhibition. Again, the smallest 
carbohydrates ( Figure 3.2 J ) were mostly unaffected by the change of the inhibition 
factors, but improvements were visible for all the groups containing larger molecules 
(Figure 3.2 K -L).  
Overall the model predictions were especially better for the concentrations of 
molecules with DP from 9 to 350. It is reasonable that larger molecules are more 
strongly affected by this type of inhibition, as they contain more branches. The 
hydrolysis of linear molecules is not influenced by the inhibition factors. The predictions 
of the model with inhibition now better resemble the experimental data, which implies 
that the inhibition constraints are essential in the model.

Next, we optimized the branch factors, without distinguishing between them. The 
improvement of the predictions was verified by comparing the graphs ( Figure 3.2 ) and 
the residuals ( Table 3.1 ) of the original model with those using the new sets of branch

53 factors. The following set  of branch factors: bI = 0.03, bII = 0.03 and bIII = 0.03 was chosen 
as optimal based on the values of the SRSS.  
However, there are only minor differences between bT = 0.03 and the one where 
all branch factors were set to 0.02, 0.04 or 0.05. When comparin g the graphs visually, 
the differences between the predictions using these values of branch factors were not as 
pronounced, even if the SRSS values differed. As shown in Table 3.1 , if all bT were equal 
to 0.03 or equal to 0.05 the divergence in the SRSS wa s mostly caused by a worse fit of 
DP 16 -35, 36 -80 and 451 -700 and a better fit for 181 -350 of the bT 0.05 and only these 
differences were noticeable in the graphs.

the inhibition due to the variation of branch factors. The average of 5 computations is presented for each 
change. The inhibition factors are either removed (‘Without inhibition’), taken from literature or all  of 
them are set to one value.  
 
The r esults show that a rather high inhibition around the branches is necessary, 
for a reasonable prediction of the concentrations of the large molecules. The effect of 
inhibition would not be as visible if only the small hydrolysis products (DP < 8) were 
analy sed and modelled, as it was the case in the study by Besselink et al. (2008) . 
Additionally, we altered the values of only one factor while keeping the 
remaining two constant. When the value of bI was lowered while the others remained at 
0.1, the improvement of  the fit based on SRSS was attained by better predictions of all

54 carbohyd rates above DP 5 (data not shown). When bII was lowered, no difference was 
observed, but lowering bIII led to a lower total SRSS mostly due to a better fit of DP 
groups 9 -15 and 16 -35 (data not shown).  
Branch factors bI and bIII thus have the biggest impa ct on the outcomes of the 
model. Branch factor bI influences the hydrolysis of the bonds in the outer branches of 
amylopectin. Decreasing the values of inhibition factors bII and bIII increases the 
inhibition of cleaving the α -(1,4) bonds located in the sa me chain as the α -(1,4,6) linked 
glucose unit, with the branched glucose unit on the reducing end side ( bII) or the non -
reducing end ( bIII) of the cleavage site.   
It is reasonable that the inhibition for the inner chains (B and C chains) of the 
amylopecti n molecule should be larger, since the glycosidic bonds in those chains are 
less accessible to the enzyme than the bonds of the outer branches (the A chains). Both 
factors bI and bIII are relevant in the binding modes affecting the outer parts of the 
amylo pectin molecule. As the outer chains of the substrate are more accessible to the 
enzyme, the binding influenced by inhibition constants bI and bIII will be more likely to 
occur, therefore these two factors will have a larger influence on the outputs.  
The description of the inhibition used in our model solely acts on the ability of 
the enzyme to hydrolyse the α -1,6-glycosidic bonds and the α -1,4-glycosidic bonds 
adjacent to the branches. In the actual hydrolysis experiments more factors affect the 
performan ce of the enzyme. Our model does not take into account transglycosylation 
and condensation reactions, enzyme inactivation, product inhibition or multiple attack. 
Each of these factors may still help improving the fit of the model, albeit at the cost of 
significantly increasing the number of parameters of the model. Since these factors are 
not included in the current model, the increased inhibition caused by the presence of 
branches might partially compensate for these other effects.  
3.4.2. Subsite map  
The bond cleavage frequencies used for the calculations of the subsite map are 
determined using analogous substrates, at low substrate concentrations and only at the 
early stages of hydrolysis. This approach allows avoiding other reactions, e.g. 
transglycosyl ation, condensation - mechanisms that can affect product distribution 
(Suganuma et al. (1978) ; Kandra et al. (2002) ; Kandra et al. (2006) ).  
An improved stochastic model for predictions of enzymatic starch hydrolysis  
55 In our experiments, due to the different substrate and time scale, we cannot 
exclude that these mechanisms influenced the final results. The differences between our 
analyses and those of Kandra et al. (2006)  may stem from us following the reaction over 
a longer period of time. Thus, our data include  the effects of the subsequent enzymatic 
attacks. Our model is meant to predict the results of the actual enzymatic hydrolysis 
experiments, on a natural substrate - starch. As we demonstrated before (chapter 2), the 
subsite map in its current state ( Kandra et al. (2002) ; Kandra et al. (2006) , also given in 
Figure 3.1 ) does not accurately describe the carbohydrate profiles obtained in our starch 
hydrolysis experiments. Therefore, we followed a step -wise analysis of the subsite map 
energy values and of their influence on the composition of the hydrolysis products.  
Analysing the binding energy values assigned to subsites gives insight into which 
hydrolysis products are favoured. Macgregor et al. (1994)  pointed out that the 
hydrolysis of substrates long enough to cover all subsites is mainly de termined by the 
two outer subsites on each side ( -5, -4 and +3, +4). The large positive value of free 
energy at subsite +4 (8.0 kJ·mol-1) suggests an unfavourable interaction between a 
glucose unit and that subsite. A repulsion at +4 causes the amylase to show preference 
for binding a reducing -end glucose residue at subsite +3 instead of at subsite +4. 
Hydrolysis of molecules bound in that way would cause more maltotriose to be formed 
from the reducing end side, and that is indeed what we observed in the co ncentrations 
of DP 3 predicted by the model using the original subsite map values – nearly 10 w/w% 
more maltotriose at 360 min compared to the experimental values.  
Assigning a 0 kJ·mol-1 binding energy value to each subsite illustrates the effect of 
that s ubsite on the product composition. Combining the graphical outputs ( Figure 3.3 ) 
with the SRSS values ( Table 3.2 ) allows us to draw conclusions on the role of a particular 
subsite in over - or underestimating the predicted carbohydrate concentrations. The 
changes in subsites +1 and -1 are unnecessary, because for a bond cleavage to occur 
these subsites always have to  be occupied. The yields of the carbohydrates are 
independent of binding energies of these subsites as long as their values remain 
constant.  
Removing the effect of subsite +4 in the model by changing its value from +8 
kJ·mol-1 to 0, influences the predict ed concentrations of all of the oligosaccharides. The 
concentrations of maltotriose and maltotetraose become similar ( Figure 3.3  C). For both 
Chapter 3   
56 components the predicted concentrations correspond better with the experimental ones 
than those predicted with the  unchanged subsite map.  
Table  3.2 Differences expressed as SRSS between the data and the predictions (average of 5 
computations) for each subsite individually changed to 0 and the original subsite map. The branch factors 
(bT) were set to 0.05 for all the computations. One subsite was changed at a time. The extreme values of 
SRSS for each carbohydrate group are shown in bold. Underlined values are more than 15% higher or 
lower than in the original model, indicating the change is caused entirely by the chang e in the energy value 
of the subsite.  
 
When the energy of subsite +4 is removed, it becomes equally possible for a 
reducing end to bind at subsite +4 and at subsite +3, as the total energy of binding for 
both of the binding modes is the same. This causes a more equal distribution of DP 3 and 
4. The concentrations of maltose and glucose are nearly unaffected by the change in 
subsite +4. On the other hand, the amounts of predicted DP 5 -8 increase quite 
substantially - after 90 minutes the concentration of ea ch of these carbohydrates is 
almost 5 w/w% higher, as compared with the output using the original value of subsite 
+4 (shown in the  Figure  A3 in the Appendix).

Figure 3.3 . The influence of changing the binding energy of the subsites to 0 on the model pr edictions of 
DP 1 -8. For each pair of graphs the binding energy of one subsite was changed to 0: (AB) subsite +3 to 0; 
(CD) subsite +4 to 0; (EF) subsite -4 to 0; (GH) subsite -5 to 0.  
With the lack of the boundary at subsite +4, long molecules have more freedom in 
binding with the enzyme. These molecules will be free to overlap the whole subsite map 
in a different way. There will no longer be a preference of binding the reducing end at 

Chapter 3   
58 subsite +3, and thus a lower amount of smaller molecules will be produ ced, since the 
hydrolysis events that produce molecules of larger sizes (>DP3) will be more common. 
The lack of the barrier at subsite +4 results therefore in a completely different pattern of 
products.  
When the energy of subsite +3 is reduced from -5.8 t o 0 kJ·mol-1, the binding of a 
reducing end glucose at subsite +2 becomes more favorable. The mode of binding in 
which subsites from +2 to -5 are occupied will now be favored, which causes an increase 
in the concentration of maltose ( Figure 3.3  A). However , the binding that includes 
subsite +3, now 0 kJ·mol-1, will result in the same amount of total energy of binding as 
the binding mode that does not include subsite +3. This is why changing the energy of 
subsite +3 leads to similar concentrations of predict ed maltose and maltotriose. The 
“lack” of subsite +3 causes only small changes in the concentrations of DP 5 and 6, but 
visibly decreases the concentration of DP 7.  
Subsite -5 on the other end of the subsite map was given a high negative binding 
energy value ( -11.1 kJ·mol-1). Because of that, the non -reducing end glucose moiety will 
preferably bind with the subsite -5 and a large amount of DP 5 is expected. Also the 
quantities of DP 6 and 7 were expected to be quite high. In the model, changing the value 
of subsite -5 to 0 kJ·mol-1 significantly decreased the concentration s of DP 5, 6 and 7, and 
lead  to a much higher production of DP 4 and DP 3 ( Figure 3.3  G and H). The increase of 
the concentration  of DP 4, was a result of the increased amount of binding over subsites 
-4 to +3 due to the low total energy of that interaction. Since subsite -4 had a rather low 
negative value assigned to it, the total energy of binding ov er subsites -3 to +3 would 
also become more common. This form of binding would further increase the production 
of maltotriose, at the expense of DP 5 and higher.  
For subsites -2, -3 and -4 a change to 0 kJ·mol-1 had no effect on any of the 
modelled carbohydrates. The joined effects of these subsites (not shown) were tested in 
groups of two ( -2 and -3, -3 and -4, -2 and -4) or all three simultaneously ( -2, -3, -4). As 
long as the remaining subsites were assigned t heir original values, changing the values 
of energies of subsites -2, -3 and -4 to 0 gave minimal or no improvement of the fit 
between the model and the data as compared to the original subsite map used. Subsite -
5 had a large negative binding energy that caused preference for binding modes 
including this subsite and diminished the effects subsites -2, -3 and -4 had on the 
An improved stochastic model for predictions of enzymatic starch hydrolysis  
59 predictions. However, if the value of subsite -5 became less negative, the energy value of 
subsite -4 would become more relevant and wou ld affect the product composition.  
Changing the value of subsite +2 to 0 (Figure A1 in the Appendix) did not have a 
major effect on the concentrations of the carbohydrates, except for increasing the 
production of glucose in the model. When the energies of  subsites -2, -3, -4 and +2 were 
changed to 0, only small differences in the concentrations of glucose and DP 5, 6 and 7 
were observed  (not shown) . The outer subsites of this endo -acting amylase clearly 
impact the product profiles more than the inner subsi tes. This illustrated what also 
Macgregor et al. (1994)  suggested - for the subsite map of  BLA at 50°C only the outer 
subsites ( -5, +3, +4) determine the distribution of the hydrolysis products.  
Our model uses Monte Carlo simulation to increase the randomness of the events 
and by that simulates the random choice of the bond to be hydrolysed in the reaction. 
Because of that, variation of up to 15% in the SRSS’s of the high molecular weight 
molecules is expected within the repetitions using the same set of parameters. Taking 
this into account, we assume that the difference in SRSS of more than 15%  signifies an 
effect solely caused by the changes made to the model, e.g., different energy value of a 
subsite.  
A number of subsites ( -5, +4 and +3) specifically affect the predictions of the 
carbohydrates larger than DP 8. These subsites caused dramatic changes in the 
carbohydrate composition that in turn affect the value of the DE. Thus, by influencing the 
DE values predicted by the model, changes made to these subsites can influence the 
fitting procedure. The differences in the SRSS of the large carbohy drates will not be 
directly affected by the change in the subsite energy, but rather by the fitting of the 
model to the data, influenced by the change in the DE value.  
Aside from changing the subsites individually we also tested the sensitivity of the 
subs ite map. Many subsite maps are calculated within an accuracy of 0.1 kJ·mol-1. To 
assess whether that is necessary we rounded the values of the subsite map to integers. 
The model with the integer subsite map resulted in no other distribution of 
carbohydrate s, showing that small changes are not enough to affect the model 
predictions.

Finally, we combined the results of all optimizations in the subsite map ( Table 
3.3). Most of the small carbohydrates were affected by the ch anges made to three or 
more subsites. As an example, the concentration of DP 4 predicted by the model may be 
increased by either reducing the energy of subsite +4 (lowering the energy from +8  
kJ·mol-1  towards 0) or increasing that of subsite -5. The conce ntration of DP4 predicted 
by the model, may be increased by increasing the value of subsite +3 (from -5.8 kJ·mol-1 
towards 0). Maltooctaose (DP 8) was the only carbohydrate that was affected by one 
subsite (+4), but it was also influenced by the inhibition . A combination of properly 
chosen parameters was thus necessary for a correct prediction.

(an increase or a decrease) in the concentration of a par ticular saccharide are shown. Subsites in bold

Based on the rules we described, we started to look for a subsite map that could 
better describe the data we collected from our experiments. We varied the energy values 
of subsites -5, +3 and +4 in a wide range because these subsites had a major influence on 
the outputs. The graphs in Figure 3.4  show how changing the energy of a subsite can 
influence the model’s predictions. The energy values of subsite +4 were varied from -1 
to 10 kJ·mol-1, while the energies of the other subsites remained unchanged ( Figure 3.4  
A). At high and low binding energy values the fit for maltotriose (DP3) and DP 5 -8 
became worse. Low binding energy of subsite +4 had a positive influence on the fit of DP 
4, whereas at high energy values DP 9 -15 fitted better. As the binding en ergy values

Figure 3.4. The changes in SRSS values of the different carbohydrates groups (DP 1 -15) as the binding 
energies of subsites +4, +3 and -5 are varied in a range of values. (A) Energy of subsite +4 varied from -1 to 
10 kJ·mol-1; (B) Energy  of subsite +3 varied from -5.5 to +1 kJ·mol-1; (C) Energy of subsite -5 varied from -
13 to +1 kJ·mol-1. The remaining subsites were assigned the original energy values from the subsite map at 
50°C (Kandra et al. 2006 ). The lower the SRSS values were, the more accurate predictions were obtained. 
The legend to all the plots is given above the figure, the lines in the plots were added to guide the eye. Note 
the differences in the scale between the plots (x and y axes).  
approached 5 and 6 kJ·mol-1 the fit improved as shown by the overall lower SRSS values. 
Similar steps have been taken for subsites -5 (Figure 3.4  C) and +3 ( Figure 3.4  B). Our 
observations led us to believe that subsite -5 should be assigned a relatively high 
negative value, as energies from -8 to -13 kJ·mol-1 lead to a better overall  fit. DP 4 was 
the only carbohydrate that showed an opposite trend, fitting less accurately as the value

After comparing several combinations of subsite changes, a subsite map was 
defined that fitted our experimental data ( Table  3.4). The new binding energy values 
improved the residuals from 413 (for only bT  = 0.03) to 326 ( bT = 0.03 and the subsite 
map as in Table 3.4 ) by improving the fit of DP 1 -8. Changes made to energies of subsites 
+3, +4 and -5 were sufficient to obtain a good fit of DP 1, 2, 3 and 5 -8, but in order to 
improve the fit of DP 4 also changes to subsite -4 needed to be made.

An improved stochastic model for predictions of enzymatic starch hydrolysis  
63 3.5. Conclusions  
The complete hydrolysis process of starch by α-amylase from B. licheniformis  was 
modelled with a stochastic model. The model uses a combination of a subsite map with 
nine binding sites in the  active centre of the enzyme and inhibition due to the proximity 
of an α -(1,6) -branching point in amylopectin. Our model is different from other models 
discussed in literature, as it follows all the products of starch hydrolysis over the whole 
course of th e reaction and allows accurate predictions of their concentrations.  
This model is also used to test and verify the accuracy of a subsite map, for 
predicting the composition of starch (both amylose and amylopectin) hydrolysis 
products. This is different fr om earlier approaches in which only hydrolysis of model 
oligosaccharides with DP up to 10 was considered for finding the binding energies of the 
subsite map.  
Using a rational data -driven fitting procedure, we propose a subsite map that 
most accurately pre dicts the composition of our data set. For optimal results, especially 
if different analytical procedures are employed, further tuning of the subsite map might 
be required. However, we demonstrated that it is sufficient to vary values of subsites -5, 
+3 an d +4 and, if necessary, the inhibition factor.  
Changing the values of the apparent binding energies of the subsites mostly 
influences the composition of small carbohydrates (DP < 8). The concentrations of the 
large molecules (DP 9 -181) over time were most ly affected by the inhibition factor. The 
structure of starch that is designed in the model most likely influences the initial 
concentrations of the largest carbohydrates (DP 350 -700).  
The inhibition factors do not significantly affect the concentrations of small 
oligosaccharides. Therefore, models that do not take into account carbohydrates larger 
than DP 5 cannot correctly estimate the actual values of the three inhibition factors. In 
those models the inhibition due to the presence of branches in amylope ctin is not 
necessarily as important.  
Transglycosylation and condensation can influence the composition of starch 
hydrolysis products. However, even without taking into account these mechanisms, our 
relatively uncomplicated model can quantitatively predic t the product composition 
during starch hydrolysis by BLA, and may thus be used to predict the product quality as 
Chapter 3   
64 function of the reaction conditions. Additionally, when hydrolysis data are available, this 
model can also be used to test the subsite maps of  other enzymes.

70 Abstract  
A stochastic model based on subsite theory, predicting the products of enzymatic 
wheat starch hydrolysis, was verified experimentally using data from starch hydrolysis 
at 80°C with Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase (BL A). The changes in the concentrations 
of all hydrolysis products were followed over time and analysed using size -exclusion 
chromatography  (HPLC -SEC) . The results from the hydrolysis at 80°C were first 
compared with previous results at 50°C to identify the effects of temperature on the 
product composition, and were subsequently used to verify the model predictions. Two 
parameters of the model, the inhibition and the subsite map, were analysed in more 
detail. The inhibition is important for correct estimation  of the concentrations of the 
high molecular weight hydrolysis products. The subsite map of BLA at 80°C that was 
taken from literature was not accurate enough to obtain the correct prediction of the 
small hydrolysis products. A new subsite map was proposed  using a step -wise 
procedure. Our procedure also led to identifying which subsites are important in 
determining the product composition. Contrary to what the literature data suggests, the 
binding energy values of the subsite maps at 50°C and at 80° were si milar.  
  
The effect of temperature on the parameters of a stochastic model  
71 4.1. Introduction  
With various factors influencing enzymatic hydrolysis it is not trivial to point out 
those that determine the distribution of hydrolysis products. The temperature and pH 
do not influence the mechanism of the reaction, but do inf luence the product 
composition. The structure of starch affects the final concentrations of the products. The 
branches in amylopectin, characterized by chain length distribution, along with the 
inability of the enzyme to cleave branches, force the enzyme t o hydrolyse amylopectin in 
a different manner than it cleaves the linear substrates.  
Changes in temperature influence enzymatic reactions by affecting the stability of 
the enzymes, competing reactions, affinity of the enzymes for activators, inhibitors an d 
for the substrate, and the rate of substrate to product conversion (Whitaker 1993 ). 
Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase (BLA) is a thermostable hydrolase that reaches its 
highest activity around its optimum temperature of 90 -95°C (Fitter et al. 2001 ). An 
enzyme is called thermostable when it has a high melting temperature (thermodynamic 
stability) or a long half -life of denaturation at a selected high temperature (kinetic 
stability) (Radestock and Gohlke 2008 ). The theories generally ascribe the differences in 
activity of thermos table enzymes at low and high temperatures to the flexibility of the 
protein ( Vihinen (1987 ), Závodszky et al. (1998 ), Panasik Jr et al. (2000 )). Enzymatic 
activity and conformational flexibility are indeed closely correlated (Závodszky et al. 
1998 ). At high temperatures, with more collisions per unit of time, the increased 
mobility of the enzyme loosens up weak bonds and allows for more flexibility in some 
regions of the molecule , while still preserving its overall 3D structure. The active site 
may have different stability than the overall protein – a local reduction in the flexibility 
of the active site is the main feature in thermophilic amylases (D'Amico et al. 2003 ). 
The active sites of hydrolases con tain  a number of binding sites that can hold the 
substrate. In case of amylases each subsite can bind one  glucose unit of the starch chain. 
The final alignment of large molecules in the catalytic site is determined by the sum of 
the interactions over a number of glucose units and their binding sites. The specificity of 
the enzyme, the degree of polymerization  of oligosaccharides produced during 
hydrolysis and the final carbohydrate profiles are determined by the number of subsites 
and the position and activity of the catalytic site (Synowie cki 2007 ). 
Chapter 4  
72 In this chapter , we present the results of a study on the thermostable α -amylase 
from Bacillus licheniformis  (BLA) and its action on wheat starch. One can use activity 
measurements to compare the action of an enzyme at different temperatures.  These 
measurements are based on the overall composition of the reaction mixture, and show 
that reaction proceeds faster or slower, but do not give a detailed description of the 
products. We investigated the changes in product distribution during hydrolysi s at 80°C 
and compared this distribution with previously described results (chapter 2) at a lower 
temperature (50°C). The data from starch hydrolysis at 80°C were then compared with 
simulations of a model that predicts the composition of starch hydrolysate s over time 
(chapters 2 and 3). The model was based on the subsite theory, and its outcomes were 
mainly determined by the affinities of the subsites, and by the inhibition in the model. 
We describe the optimization of these parameters, such that the model reliably predicts 
the hydrolysis, and discuss their individual influence on the composition of wheat starch 
hydrolysates at 80°C.  
4.2. Materials  
Unmodified wheat starch (S5127) with 13.68 ± 0.24% of moisture (Sigma -
Aldrich, Germany) was hydrolyzed with t he thermostable α -amylase from Bacillus 
licheniformis  (Sigma, Thermamyl 120®, a product of Novozyme  Corp.). All chemicals 
(sodium hydroxide, calcium chloride di -hydrate (Merck, Germany)), carbohydrate 
standards for HPLC calibration (glucose, maltose, maltotriose, maltotetrose, 
maltopentose, maltohexose and maltoheptose, all minimum 90% purity, Sigma -Aldrich, 
Germany) and dextran analytical standards for gel permeation chromatography (5, 12, 
25 and 50 kDa) were at least analytical grade. MilliQ water was used for the preparation 
of all solutions.  
4.3. Methods  
4.3.1. Starch hydrolysis  
The method used for gelatinization and enzymatic starch hydrolysis followed the 
same protocol as described in chapter 2 with the exception of using a higher 
temperature (80°C) during hydrolysis. In summary, a suspension of wheat starch in 
demineralized water (10 w/w%) with 5 mM CaCl 2·2H 2O was heated to 90°C and mixed 
The effect of temperature on the parameters of a stochastic model  
73 (300 rpm) to gelatinize the starch for 1 hour. The temperature of the gelatinized mixture 
was then lowered to 80°C (± 1°C) and 0.01 w/w% of α -amylase from Bacillus 
licheniformis  was added. During the reaction, sam ples of hydrolyzed starch mixture 
were pipetted into Eppendorf tubes and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen to stop the 
hydrolysis.  
4.3.2. Determination of carbohydrate composition  
A fraction of the frozen starch samples (0.3 g) was diluted with 90 µl of 2 M NaOH 
and 1,110 μl of demineralized water and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2,400 × g and 
4°C. The supernatant was filtered using syringes and Minisart single use filters.  
The carbohydrate composition was measured by using size exclusion 
chromatography (HPLC -SEC). The Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system was equipped 
with a Shodex Sugar KS -803 column with KS -G guard and an RI -detector. The column 
was operated at 80°C and used MilliQ water as eluent at a flow -rate of 0.3 ml·min-1.  
Using the equation from the  calibration curve, prepared with standards of known 
molecular weight, and the average molecular weight of each group of carbohydrates, we 
estimated the elution times. The mass fractions of carbohydrates within each group 
were calculated as described in ch apter 2.  
Hydrolysis experiments were performed in triplicate and the resulting data were 
compared with the model. We randomly chose one set of data for the comparison of the 
experiments with the model, as the differences between the individual data sets we re 
small and insignificant. All data sets are shown in Figure A 1 in the Appendix.  
4.3.3. Model  
The model described in chapter 2 was used with small adaptations. The model 
was adjusted for the increased temperature of the reaction (80°C) and consequently the 
subsite map that is available for Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase at 80°C was used 
(Kandra et al. (2006 )).  
All presented model outpu ts are the average values based on three repetitions 
with the same set of parameters. Since the model is stochastic in nature, the three runs 
do not give exactly equal results. However, the differences between the results were an 
indication of the reliabil ity of the result s, which was high. Matlab 2012a (7.14) was used 
Chapter 4  
74 to perform all simulations. Two parameter sets of the model were analysed in detail: the 
subsite map and the branch factors. For more details on these parameters we refer to 
chapter 3 and Marchal et al. (2003 ). 
The distribution of the hydrolysis products is affected by the values of apparent 
binding energies within  the subsite map. The binding energy values of the original 
subsite map (Kandra et al. 2006 ) were treated as initial values. During the simulations 
one by one the energy of each subsite was set to 0, thereby removing the effect of that 
subsite completely. This procedure demonstrated which groups of saccharides were 
especially affected by a particular subsite. After changing the binding energies of a 
subsite within a range of values and comparing how the outcomes of the model differ, it 
becomes possible to choose the approximate binding energy of each subsite. The 
optimi zation of the subsite map was confirmed using the square root of the sum of 
squares of the differences between the model and the data (SRSS).  
As demonstrated previously (chapter 3), inhibition had an effect on the 
concentrations of the high molecular weig ht products. Three different branch factors 
(Marchal et al. 2003 ) were necessary for a correct description of the inhibition. During 
the simulations of the subsite map these branch factors were set to: bI = 0.1, bII = 0.1 and 
bIII = 0.1. These values were subsequently varied until the best -fitting set of branch 
factors was obtained.  
4.4. Results and discussion  
4.4.1. Experimenta l results of starch hydrolysis at different temperatures  
The product profiles of starch hydrolysis by BLA at 80°C (Figure  4.1) are 
qualitatively simila r to profiles during hydrolysis at lower temperature (50°C) (chapter 
2). Within the first minutes of the reaction the high molecular weight molecules (eluting 
at retention time 17 -20 min) are hydrolysed. In the following 60 minutes the enzyme 
attacks mainl y the largest molecules present in the solution, represented by the tall peak 
at 21 minutes (DP > 300). As these molecules are degraded to cluster -sized smaller 
structures (DP 150 -300), also the quantities of the oligosaccharides begin to increase. 
The int ermediate size molecules (DP 20 -150) remain on a steady level for as long as 
cluster -size molecules are available for the enzyme. Starting from the 120th minute, 
these intermediate size molecules become the enzyme’s main target. As only the 
The effect of temperature on the parameters of a stochastic model  
75 quantities of maltose, glucose and DP 9 -15 increase during that period, these 
intermediate size molecules seem to be hydrolysed by cleaving off small units (glucose, 
maltose). The branched structures that are left (DP < 20) can only be hydrolysed with 
difficulty. In the  final stages of the reaction all molecules of DP > 20 are hydrolysed, and 
finally mostly mono -, di- and oligosaccharides remain.

during six stages of the reaction. The dotted plot represents the logarithm of average apparent molecular 
weight of the standards at the indicated retention times.  
A com parison of the hydrolysis results shows that the reaction proceeds faster at 
80°C than it does at 50°C ( Figure 4.2  A-C). Up until the 120th minute of the reaction the 
concentrations of DP1 -8 increase linearly for both temperatures. At 80°C, the slope of DE  
vs. time is larger, reflecting a 1.5 times higher product formation rate than at 50°C. In the 
advanced stages of hydrolysis the increased probability of non -productive bindings 
contributes to the decrease in the rate of reaction (Synowiecki 2007 ). The high  
molecular weight molecules are digested much more rapidly in the beginning of the 
reaction and at the higher temperature. At 80°C, these large molecules have been 
hydrolysed after 180 minutes.

or vs the dextrose equivalent (DE).  
The increased reaction rate is not the only difference between the two sets of 
data. The relative concentrations of the oligosaccharides are also different at different 
temperatures. At 80°C the quantities of DP 5 -8 are somewhat lower, and more 
maltotriose, maltose and glucose are produced, compared to the reaction at 50°C. 
However, when the d ata are plotted as a function of the dextrose equivalent (the degree 
of conversion), the differences become smaller. The concentrations of maltose (at DE 10 -
20), DP 9 -15 and 16 -35 (at DE 5 -20) are slightly higher at 80 °C, whereas the 
concentrations of DP 5 -8 (at DE 15 -20) keep increasing at 50°C, when at 80°C they begin 
to decrease ( Figure 4.2 D-F). This shows that the hydrolysis temperature does not 
substantially affect the product composition after all.  
A more flexible binding between the enzyme and the s ubstrate in the active site 
at high temperatures may render an increased number of productive complexes 
between the enzyme and substrate, that leads to an increased reaction rate. However, 
this larger flexibility in binding of the substrate could also lead  to decreased specificity 

The effect of temperature on the parameters of a stochastic model  
77 of the enzyme at high temperatures, which indeed has been reported ( Marchal et al. 
(1999 ), Nakakuki et al. (1984 ), Saito (1973 )). 
Marchal et al. (1999 ) observed differences in product composition (DP 1 -10) at 
different temperatures (50, 70 and 90°C) during the hydrolysis of a mylopectin from 
potato with B. licheniformis  α-amylase. The changes in temperature especially affected 
the final concentrations of maltose and maltopentose. The authors speculated that the 
differences could stem either from amylopectin molecules being more  rigid at lower 
temperatures or the different capability of the enzyme to hydrolyse DP 5 and 6 at 
different temperatures. In addition, differences in product composition may result from 
increased transglycosylation. Some of these factors may affect the com position of our 
samples as well, but we see much smaller differences between 50°C and 80°C . The larger 
differences in the oligosaccharides concentrations in the samples of Marchal et al. 
(1999 ) as compared to our samples may also stem from the use of a different source of 
substrate (pot ato vs. wheat) and/or the lack of amylose.  
The differences in the energy values of the subsite maps at 50 and 80°C ( Kandra 
et al. (2006 ), summarized in Figure 4.6) imply that the composition of products differs at 
a higher temperature. In the subsite map for 80°C the barrier site (subsite +4) has a 
lowe r energy value (+4.1 kJ·mol-1) than the same subsite at 50°C (+8 kJ·mol-1). This 
smaller barrier allows for a more uniform distribution of the products, e.g. more DP 4 is 
produced at higher temperatures. In fact, nearly all subsites (with the exception of -5 
and +2) are assigned much lower energy values at 80°C.  
4.4.2. Predicting the product composition  
BLA hydrolysis of starch at 80°C yields a higher final dextrose equivalent (DE 30) 
in the same amount of time as at 50°C. The higher DE is the result of a rapid 
accumulation of the small hydrolysis products. In our simulations, the DE, along with the 
number of formed enzyme -substrate complexes , are used to fit the model data to the 
experimental results. The model DE needs to be at least as high as in the exp eriments for 
a good description of the experimental results. With the same number of hydrolysis 
events occurring during the simulation (timespan), as chosen for the 50°C model (3·106 
events), it was not possible to reach the DE of 30 when using the origina l subsite map at 
80°C. The timespan was therefore extended to 2·107 events, or in some cases even to 
Chapter 4  
78 4·107 hydrolysis events. The intervals, at which the hydrolysis events were saved, were 
kept constant to make the comparisons possible, even if the total n umber of events was 
larger.  
4.4.2.1.   The subsite map  
The overall fit of the model and data was not satisfactory with the original values 
of the subsite map at 80°C found in literature (Kandra et al. 2006 ). The subsite map 
influences the composition of oligosaccharides, but does not have a major effect on the 
molecul es with a degree of polymerization (DP) larger than 8 (chapter 3). Figure 4.3 
shows that the predicted concentrations of e.g. maltose and maltotetrose should be 
higher and the concentrations of maltotriose and DP 5 -8 need to be lower.  
 
Figure 4.3. Predictions of the model (lines) with the original subsite map for 80°C (see Figure 4.6) 
compared with the experimental data (symbols) from wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA at the same 
temperature. Inhibition factors were set to 0.1.  
We thus wish to improv e the subsite map following similar steps as described 
previously (chapter 3). First, the values of energy assigned to every subsite were 
changed to 0, to assess the influence of each subsite on the composition of the products 
(Figure 4.4 and Table A1  in the Appendix). Three of the changes necessary for better 
predictions in Figure 4.3 B and C (DP 2, 3 and 5 -8) already follow with the value of 
subsite +3 set to 0. Subsite -2 did not influence the composition when its energy was 
changed to 0: the simulation yielded the same outcome as with the original subsite map. 
Changing subsite -3 had only marginal effect on the product composition. However, 
varying the value of subsite +3 with simultaneous adjustment of the values of subsites 
+4 and -5 was most relevant for more accurate prediction of the hydrolysis products.

Table 4.1 summarizes the information about the influence of subsites on the 
concentration  of a particular oligosaccharide, based on the results shown in Figure 4 .4 
and the SRSS values given in Table A1 . The change of the energy of a subsite either 
caused an increase in the concentration of a carbohydrate, a decrease or had no 
influence at all.  Subsites that appear most often in Table 4.1 influence the concentrations 
of numerous oligosaccharides in a substantial way.

all nine subsites, onl y those that influence (increase or decrease) the concentration of a saccharide are

The energy values of the outer subsites are more important when it comes to 
predicting the product composition. The composition of small hydrolysis products is 
especially affected by subsites -5, +2 and +3. Therefore, the binding energies of these 
subsites  were varied in a range of values, to converge to more accurate energy values 
and thus improve the predictions. The results for two of the subsites are shown in 
Figure 4.5. By assigning different energy values to a subsite we were able to limit the 
apparent binding energy values to those resulting in an improved fit of the model and 
the data.  
 
The effect of temperature on the parameters of a stochastic model

Figure 4.5. The changes in SRSS values as (A) the binding energy of subsite +3 is varied from 0 to -7.2 
kJ·mol-1 and (B) the binding energy of subsite -5 is varied from 0 to 11.2 kJ·mol-1. The remaining subsites 
were assigned the original energy values from the subsi te map at 80°C (Kandra et al. 2006 ). The lower the 
SRSS values a re, the more accurate predictions are obtained. The legend is given above the figure, the lines 
in the plots are added to guide the eye.  
Subsite +2 was omitted from Figure 4.5, because the variation of this subsite 
between -3 and -7 kJ·mol-1 gave no change s, as long as the other subsites had their 
original values. We therefore chose to keep the original value ( -5.6 kJ·mol-1) of subsite 
+2, as we found no reas on to change it. Only completely removing  the subsite by 
assigning it a value of 0, caused a visible  change in the concentrations of 
oligosaccharides.  
The binding energy values of subsite +3 were varied between 0 and -7.2 kJ·mol-1 
(Figure 4.5 A). For subsite +3 the analysis of the residuals is not entirely 
straightforward, since we observed better agreem ent with some oligosaccharides  and 
poorer with others, as the energy was changed. The energy of subsite +3 must be high 
enough (0 or -1 kJ·mol-1) for an optimal fit of maltose (DP 2) and yet low enough to 
facilitate a good fit of maltotriose (DP 3) and mal totetraose (DP 4).  
Subsite -5 influences the concentrations of most of the oligosaccharides. The 
energy values of subsite -5 were varied from 0 to -11.2 kJ·mol-1 (Figure 4.5 B). When the 
energy value assigned to subsite -5 is close to 0 the fit of the mod el is poor for the 
oligosaccharides, but not for the DP 9 -15 group. As demonstrated by the SRSS values in 
Figure 4.5 B, the predictions correspond better with the data when subsite -5 is assigned

kJ·mol-1).  
Overall, the model results at 80°C are more sensitive to changes in the subsite 
map than the outputs at 50°C. Changes to subsites -2, -3, -4 and +2 had little influence on 
the prediction of the hydrolysis products at 50°C (chapter 3). At 80°C, only subsites -2 
and -3 seem to have no effect on the predictions ( Figure 4 .4 EF and GH). Energy changes 
in all of the remaining subsites lead to significant changes in the concentrations of the 
oligosaccharides. As at 80°C the h ydrolysis was more extensive and yielded higher 
quantities of products within the same amount of time, the energy changes of more than 
just the three subsites could have actually influenced the model predictions.  
The final predictions of the model, just as  in the experimental hydrolysis, depend 
on the combination of the binding energies of multiple subsites. The optimal binding 
energy of each subsite is based not only on obtaining the best value of that subsite, but 
also the right energy values assigned to the subsites around it. The energy value of each 
subsite (e.g., subsite +3) can therefore be found only after it has been varied together 
with the energies assigned to other subsites (e.g., +2, +4 and -5).  
 
Figure 4.6. The binding energies [kJ·mol-1] of subsites of Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase (BLA) at  50 and 
80°C  as given by Kandra et al. (2006 ) and the new subsite maps at 50 °C (from Chapter 3)  and at 80 °C 
developed in this chapter  based on the data from wheat starch hydrolysis .  
Our step -wise analysis of the subsite map can be compiled into a  new subsite 
map ( Figure 4.6). T his new subsite map allows accurate predictions of the 
concentrations of the oligosaccharides obtained during hydrolysis of wheat starch at 
80°C by BLA. Compared to the original subsite map, the most important changes were 
made in the energies of subsites +3 and -5. Lowering the energy of subsite +3 to -1 
kJ·mol-1 and the energy of subsite -5 to -7 kJ·mol-1 was already enough to substantially 

The effect of temperature on the parameters of a stochastic model  
83 improve the fit of the model. The total SRSS value reduced from 430 (out of which DP  1-
8 was 161) for the original subsite map to 360 (74 for DP 1 -8) for the new one, because 
of more accurate predictions of DP 2, 3, 4 and 5 -8. Subsequent changes made to the 
energy values of subsites +4, -4, and -3 facilitated an improved fit of DP 2 and D P 5-8 and 
improved the shape of the model curves (total SRSS 365, out of which DP 1 -8 was 68).  
 
Figure 4.7 The outputs of the model (lines) simulating hydro lysis with the new subsite map (Figure 4.6) 
fitted with the experimental data (symbols) from wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA at 80°C.  
The new subsite map gives more accurate predictions and the lowest SRSS values 
with DP 1 -8. However, in the process of choosing the best subsite map several other 
combinations resulted in a similar outcome ( Figure A2  in th e supplementary material). 
Marchal et al. (2003 ) used a different approach for optimizing the subsite map of the α -
amylase fr om Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  for hydrolysis of potato amylopectin (50°C), but 
also noticed that more than one subsite map can lead to nearly the same model 
predictions with only small differences in SRSS values. In their most accurate four final 
subsite m aps the energy values of subsites -6, -5, +2, +3 and +4 barely changed. The 
largest differences in the energy values were seen for the inner subsites -4, -3 and -2. We 
thus hypothesize that the values of the outer subsites are more important and therefore 
must remain stable (conserved subsites) for accurate predictions, whereas the energies 
assigned to the inner subsites had only minor effect on the final outcome of the model 
regardless of their values, and therefore could be changed without consequences.  
When comparing the new subsite map with the one we obtained for BLA at 50°C, 
we notice that the energy values of the individual subsites are more similar than in the 
maps of Kandra et al. (2006 ). It is unclear whether the reason for the differences 
between our and the previously reported subsite maps lay s in the different substrates 
(starch vs tagged maltooligosaccharides) or in the much longer time given for the 

Chapter 4  
84 hydrolysis in our case. However, it is known that liquefying enzymes preferably degrade 
substrates with more than 15 glucose units (Synowiecki 2007 ), and therefore shorter 
substrates are expected to form different enzyme -substrate interaction. When Ermer et 
al. (1993 ) used two slightly different substrates in subsite mapping of glu coamylase 
from A. niger , p-nitrophenyl -α-maltooligosaccharides and maltooligosaccharides , they 
found that the subsite affinities differed substantially for these two short linear 
substrates. The difference in the structure between such substrates and starch will also 
result in different subsite maps. Neither our method, nor the one used by Kandra et al. 
(2006 ) are a direct measurement of th e energy of binding within a subsite map, and thus 
it is difficult to draw absolute conclusions from either of these.  
Studies on thermostable enzymes show that at room temperature most of these 
enzymes have low catalytic activity ( Fitter et al. (2001 ), Rad estock and Gohlke (2011 )). 
The activity of thermostable enzymes increases with increasing temperature, reaching 
the highest point near the optimum temperature. The active site or the regions around it 
are more rigid at lower temperatures (so -called over ly stable structure), and become 
more flexible only when the temperature increases towards the optimum value 
(Závodszky et al. (1998 ), Radestock and Gohlke (2011 )). At high temperatures, the 
enzyme maintains its native structure by remaining rigid enough to avoid denaturation 
and flexible enough to remain active ( Fontana et al. (1998 )). However, the ‘loosening’ of 
the active site would suggest that the subsite binding would be weaker at higher 
temperatures. While the subsite map by Kandra et al. (2006 ) at 80°C  shows overall 
stronger binding compared to the one at 50°C  (all negative binding energies toge ther 
shift from -36.3 to -45.3 kJ·mol-1), in the new subsite maps the overall binding energies 
are reduced at higher temperatures (all negative binding energies shift from -35.7 to -
32.9 kJ·mol-1). This aligns better with the general idea of the ‘loosening’ of the active 
centre.  
Thermostable enzymes can have multiple conformations at low temperatures 
that render them dysfunctional (Panasik Jr et al. 2000 ). Certain conformations of the 
enzyme prevent the substrate from fitting in the subsite or active site in the same way. 
The active site of BLA at temperatures  below 60°C is rather rigid (Fitter et al. 2001 ), 
which can be one cause for lower activity at mesophilic temperatures. BLA has a 
relatively low activation energy measured in the range  between 50 and 90°C and it 
The effect of temperature on the parameters of a stochastic model  
85 shows a strong increase in reactivity with temperature, as the relative activity of the 
enzyme nearly doubles within this temperature range (Fitter et al. 2001 ). The low 
activation energy also implies that binding energies at these temperatures will be high. 
The binding energies will then dictate the further course of the process, into cleavage 
and desorption of the reaction products.  
4.4.2.2.   Inhibition  
While the subsite map is most important for correct prediction of the small 
oligosaccharides, the inhibition is a major determinant in the predictions of the larger 
carbohydrates. Endo -acting α -amylases yield larger oligosaccharides as products of 
starch d egradation, mainly because hydrolysis of α -1,4-linkages close to the non -
reducing end of a substrate molecule is slower for these enzymes (MacGregor et al. 
2001 ). Lowering the values of the branch factors ( bT) increases the inhibition of 
hydrolysing α -1,4-bonds in the proximity of branches (glucose units with an α -1,4,6 -
bonds) (chapter 3). An increased inhibition in the model results in a higher number of 
non-productive complexes formed, by allowing more possi bilities for non -productive 
binding. The higher the inhibition, the more hydrolysis events are required to reach the 
same DE value, which has impact on both the absolute rate of hydrolysis and on the 
relative concentrations of the reaction products.  
In th e model of starch hydrolysis at 50°C it was necessary to use low values of the 
branch factors (0.05 or 0.03), because at the lower temperature the hydrolysis rate was 
overall lower (Figure 4.2). At 80°C the active centre is more flexible, which is expected  to 
lead to lower inhibition, and therefore the values of the branch factors are higher than 
those chosen in the model at 50°C.  
The subsite map (80°C) was optimized with all three branch factors set to 0.1 
(total SRSS of 365). Increasing the values of inh ibition factors above 0.1 led to worse 
predictions and a higher SRSS value in all cases (examples are given in Table A2  in the 
supplementary material). With the proposed subsite map ( Figure 4.6) and the branch 
factors set to 0.09 the fit of the model impro ved (total SRSS 336). The lower values of the 
branch factors resulted in lower SRSS values of all groups starting from DP 36 -180 till 
DP 450 -700.  

Chapter 4  
86 Lowering the branch factors below 0.09 did not result in a lower SRSS value of 
the model in all but one case (Table A2 ). Decreasing the branch factors below 0.09 
especially affected the predictions of DP 5 -8, causing a decline in the concentration of 
this group as the inhibition in the model increased. With branch factors set to 0.09 the 
inhibition extended up to  8 bonds away from the branch point, weakening with 
increasing distance from the α -1,6-linkage. With branch factors set to values lower than 
0.09 the extent and distance of the inhibition increased, which lowered the chance of 
detaching products that fall in the group of DP 5 -8. 
At any lower values of the branch factors the inhibition was nearly irrelevant to 
the fit of large carbohydrates and did not affect their concentrations. The only lower 
total SRSS (323) appeared when the branch factors were set to 0.06, but we deemed the 
resulting poor fit of the group DP 5 -8 to be unacceptable. Other improvements became 
insufficient to make up for it. Since we could not realise further improvement using 
different sets of branch factors ( Table A2 ), we assumed that t he minimum value was 
reached. We concluded that as long as the branch factors were set to 0.1 or just below, 
the best possible fit between the model and the data was accomplished.  
The flexibility of the active site along with the higher collision rates at  higher 
temperatures contribute to faster hydrolysis of the largest molecules present in the 
solution. One may expect that a reduced specificity in the binding between enzyme and 
substrates also translates in less hindrance due to the proximity of branches . Therefore 
the inhibition should decay faster with the distance from an α -1,6-bond branch point, 
and thus the values of branch factors should become higher at higher temperatures. We 
speculate that in the extreme, this might even lead to the hydrolysis of  α-1,6-bonds at 
higher temperatures. MacGregor et al. (2001 ) states that an α -1,4-linked glucose and an 
α-1,6-linked glucose cannot be bound the same way in the active site. The amylase 
capable of cleaving both α -1,4- and α -1,6- linkages needs to be quite flexib le in the active 
site, especially at subsite +1. Since the flexibility of thermostable proteins increases at 
high temperatures ( Panasik Jr et al. (2000 ), Závodszky et al. (1998 ), Vihinen (1987 )), we 
cannot exclude that the chance increases that some of the α -1,6-bound glucose units 
might also be hydrolysed. It should be clear that this is not c overed by our current 
model.

87 4.5. Conclusions  
Hydrolysis of wheat starch by Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase (BLA) at different 
temperatures does not result in drastically different product composition.  
The model discussed in this chapter  can describe th e distribution of all products 
during the course of wheat starch hydrolysis by Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase (BLA) 
at different temperatures. The predictions of the model at 80°C are accurate with a 
newly developed subsite map of BLA, based on the compo sition of products from starch 
hydrolysis. The binding energies in the new maps are less divergent than in the existing 
ones, and the differences in the binding energies between 50°C  and 80°C  are in 
accordance with the proposed mechanism of ‘loosening’ of the active centre.  
Based on the data we collected, more than one subsite map can be accurate 
enough to predict the composition of oligosaccharides present in the product mixture. 
The energies of some subsites influence the reaction strongly and are therefo re 
conserved (especially -5, +3 and +4), while the energy values of other sites do not have a 
major impact, and thus can differ considerably (e.g. subsite -2 or -3). 
At 80°C the inhibition is lower than at 50°C. We expect that to be a result of 
higher flex ibility of the enzyme at elevated temperatures, described for thermostable 
enzymes.   
Both the intrinsic factors (properties of the enzyme) and the extrinsic ones 
(dependent on the substrate characteristics) influence the final composition of products 
duri ng starch hydrolysis by α -amylase, and have to be taken into account when 
modelling enzymatic hydrolysis reactions.

at high substrate concentrations

Chapter 5  
94 Abstract  
Complete hydrolysis of wheat starch was simulated using a liquefaction model 
and a sacch arification model  that are based on subsite theory and use the sub site maps 
of the enzymes to predict the hydrolysis products. The liquefaction model was also used 
to create the substrate matrices for the saccharification model. Available subsite maps of 
glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger  (GA) were tested in the sacchar ification model to 
identify the best subsite map to describe the product composition of the hydrolysed 
samples. The experimental data were collected during a three -step process. Starch 
gelatinization in a shearing device preceded the two -step enzymatic hyd rolysis reaction. 
The liquefaction of wheat starch by Bacillus licheniformis  α-amylase (BLA) at 80°C and 
subsequent saccharification by glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger  at 60°C were 
followed over time at high substrate concentrations (30 -60 w/w%). All o f the hydrolysis 
products were then analysed by using HPLC -SEC. The composition of the hydrolysis 
products in the experiments and the products predicted by the models were compared 
and the quality of the predictions was evaluated. We demonstrated that the models can 
predict the outcome of starch hydrolysis at different conditions (e.g., different substrate 
concentrations) and for different types of enzymes.  
  
Modelling liquefact ion and saccharification at high substrate concentrations  
95 5.1. Introduction  
Intensification of starch hydrolysis by reducing the water content can increase 
the volumetric productivity (van der Veen et al. 2006 ), and the stability of enzymes ( de 
Cordt et al. (1994) , Rosendal et al. (1979) ), while lowering the energy costs during 
heating or evaporation ( van der Veen et al. (2006) , Grafelman and Meagher (1995) ). 
However, these benefits come at a price, as increasing the concentration of starch leads 
to increased viscosity of the solution t hat impairs mixing, transport in convectional jet 
cookers (Grafelman and Meagher 1995 ) and also imposes mass transfer limitations 
(Baks et al. (2008) , Sanromán et al. (1996) ). On top of those effects, pH and temperature 
control, inhomogeneity (Curic et al. 1998 ), and longer reaction times add to the 
complexity of lo w moisture systems.  
From a chemical standpoint, starch is merely a homopolymer of glucose. 
Unfortunately, when forming a solution in water starch exhibits complex physical 
properties. At high concentrations (>50%), starch slurries start to resemble 
pseudo plastic fluids and their apparent viscosity increases with increasing shear rate 
(Miranda et al. (1991) , Sanromán et al. (1996) ). This shear -thickening behaviour impairs 
mixing at increased dry matter concentrations.  
Melting of starch granules is a requirement for complete hydrolysis of starch. 
However, gelatinization of starch becomes more difficult as the moisture content 
decreases. According to Baks et al. (2007) , complete thermal gelatinization of 60 w/w% 
starch s lurry is possible only when temperatures above 120°C are applied (45 minute -
long treatment). For comparison, at 10 w/w% of starch, complete gelatinization can 
already be reached at 70°C ( Baks et al. (2007) ). However, both Baks et al. (2008)  using 
an extruder and van der Veen et al. (2006)  using a shearing device demonstrated that if 
during gelatinization of starch a mechanical and a thermal treatment are combined, 
complete gelatinization of starch can be achieved, even at low moisture contents and at 
lower temperatures. The mechanical stress (e.g., shear stress) facilitates the breakdown 
of starch granules and the loss of order of the granular structure which, just as 
gelatinization, increases the surface area of the substrate (Baks et al. 2008 ). Shearing 
also facilitates the homogeneity of the sample, contrary to samples obtained in a batch 
reactor (preliminary tests) or in an extruder (Curic et al. 1998 ). 
Chapter 5  
96 When the starch concentration increases, the branched structure of a mylopectin 
imposes steric hindrance that can decrease the rate of the reaction (Sanromán et al. 
1996 ). While mass transfer limitations are decreasing when depolymerisation of starch  
occurs during hydrolysis, especially during liquefaction (Sanromán et al. 1996 ), most of 
the other effects remain. During saccharification, additionally  the occurrence of the 
rever sed reaction, product inhibition by glucose (Cepeda et al. 2001 ) and crystallization 
add to the complexity of concentrated systems.  
With many opposite forces at p lay, a model describing enzymatic hydrolysis of 
starch at increased substrate concentrations can become complex. Available models of 
saccharification by glucoamylase focus on simulating the most optimal hydrolysis 
conditions ( Cepeda et al. (2001) , Curic et al. (1998) ), predicting the concentration of 
glucose, sometimes also maltose and maltotriose ( Nikolov et al. (1989) , Lee et al. (1992) , 
Nagy et al. (1992) , Åkerberg et al. (2000) , Cepeda et al. (2001) , Rashid et al. (2006) ) and 
describing the inhibition or enzyme activity ( Zanin and D e Moraes (1996) , 
GonzalezTello et al. (1996) , Polakovič and Bryjak (2002) , van der Veen et al. (2005) ). 
Most of these models are empirical or deterministic models, based on the M ichaelis -
Menten equation, usually simplifying the substrate by treating it as a single reacting 
component ( Cepeda et al. (2001) , Nagy et al. (1992) ,van der Vee n et al. (2005) ).  
To our knowledge there are no publications describing t he simulation of both 
liquefaction and saccharification, at substrate concentrations exceeding 30 w/w% or 
describing formation of all hydrolysis products. Van der van der Veen et al. (2005)  
obtained a satisfactory fit when following the hydrolysis of a 60% maltodext rins 
solution to glucose and maltose using a deterministic model with reversed reactions. 
Later on van der Veen et al. (2006)  also described their predictions of the dextrose 
equivalent (DE) at 35 -65%, yet they did not compare the simulations with any 
experimental results.  
The stochastic model, described in our previous work (c hapter 2, 3 and 4), 
follows the concentrations of all molecules present in the reaction mixture, in a range of 
reaction conditions, provided the DE values in time are known. The subsite map of the 
enzyme should also be known , but as subsite mapping of enzy mes becomes easier using 
computer programs ( Kandra et al. (2002) , Gyémánt et al. (2002) , Mótyán et al. (2011) ), 
more subsite maps are becoming ava ilable.  
Modelling liquefact ion and saccharification at high substrate concentrations  
97 This chapter reports on a model predicting all the products present during the 
enzymatic liquefaction and saccharification of wheat starch at high dry matter contents. 
The model predicting the products of wheat starch liquefaction by Bacillus lich eniformis  
α-amylase (BLA) was already tested at relatively low (10 w/w%) substrate 
concentrations (chapters 2, 3 and 4). In this chapter we describe the use of the model to 
predict the outcomes of liquefaction at higher starch concentrations (30 -60 w/w%), 
without implementing any additional limitations (i.e., mass transfer limitations, 
additional inhibition etc.). The outcome of this model – the matrix representing 
hydrolysed starch (maltodextrins), is used as the input for the saccharification model.  
Subs equently, we describe the second step in starch hydrolysis, the 
saccharification of the liquefied starch by glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger . The 
model of starch liquefaction is converted into a model for an exoamylase and follows 
over time the hydrolys is of maltodextrins into glucose. Several subsite maps available 
for glucoamylase are tested in the model and compared with the results from hydrolysis 
at 30% dry matter. After the subsite map that best describes the formation of 
saccharification products is chosen, it is then used to predict the saccharification 
products at higher substrate concentrations.  
5.2. Materials  
Unmodified wheat starch (S5127) with the moisture content of 11.9 ± 0.2% was 
purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Bacillus  licheniformis  bacterial 
thermostable α -amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) Type XII -A (Thermamyl 120®) and glucoamylase 
from Aspergillus niger  were selected for hydrolysis, as both are commonly used in the 
commercial hydrolysis of starch. Both enzymes were ordered from Sigma -Aldrich 
(products of Novozyme Corp.). All the solutions were prepared using Milli -Q water. 
Analytical grade sodium hydroxide, sulphuric acid and calcium chloride di -hydrate 
originated from Merck, Germany. Carbohydrate standards for HPLC calibration ( glucose, 
maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose and maltoheptaose, 
minimum 90% purity) and dextran analytical standards for gel permeation 
chromatography (5, 12, 25 and 50 kDa) were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich, Germany.  
 
 
Chapter 5  
98 5.3. Methods  
5.3.1. Gelatinization  
The overall method used for starch hydrolysis resembled the method proposed 
by van der Veen et al. (2006) . Starch mixtures (30, 40, 50 or 60% dry matter) were 
prepared using MilliQ water with the addition of CaCl 2 (5mM). The gelatinization of 
starch took place in a conical shearing device with contro lled shear rate, which used 
similar principles to a rheometer (for more details about the device we refer to van der 
Zalm et al. (2012) . The space between the two cones of the shear cell was filled with the 
starc h mixture. Starch was then mixed for 60 minutes with the speed of 50 rpm, at 90°C. 
The mechanical treatment (shear) along with the high temperature not only ensured 
complete gelatinization thanks to equally distributed temperature, but also allowed 
proper mixing and homogeneity of the samples with low water contents.  
The dry matter contents of the samples were measured using a moisture analyser 
balance after gelatinization was finished. If necessary, water was added to maintain the 
right substrate concentr ation. The amount of water added to the gelatinized samples 
varied from 4 v/w% for the 30 w/w% samples up to 22 v/w% for the samples 
containing 60 w/w% dry matter.  
5.3.2. Hydrolysis  
The shear cell was not used for enzymatic hydrolysis for two reasons. Ope ning 
and closing the device caused evaporation of moisture, which was especially unwanted 
in the already concentrated samples. Second, the high mechanical stress applied during 
gelatinization could lead to enzyme inactivation, and that was why better resul ts were 
obtained when the enzyme was added after the thermo -mechanical treatment ( Baks et 
al. (2008) , van der Veen et al. (2006) ). To avoid enzyme inactivation and moisture loss, 
the hydrolysis of starch was carried out in a batch reactor equi pped with an anchor 
stirrer. Although a batch system was more optimal for sampling and allowed for better 
preservation of enzymatic activity, it also had its drawbacks. The biggest challenges 
were the mixing in the top part of the reactor during liquefacti on and avoiding the risk 
of crystallization during saccharification.  
 
Modelling liquefact ion and saccharification at high substrate concentrations  
99 5.3.2.1.   Liquefaction  
After gelatinized starch was transferred from the shearing device into a batch 
reactor, the temperature of the mixture was adjusted. Subsequently, Bacillus 
licheniformis  α-amylase (BLA) was added to the substrate mixture and liquefaction 
reaction took place for 5 hours (80°C, 150 rpm, E = 0.1 w/w%). Samples were taken 
regularly and frozen in liquid nitrogen to stop the reaction. Due to the limitation of the 
shear cell sample size, in the experiments that continued as saccharification only one 
sample, at 5h, was taken during liquefaction.  
5.3.2.2.   Saccharification  
After the liquefaction process was finished, the temperature in the reactor was 
lowered to 60°C and the pH was adjusted to 4.5 using 1N H 2SO 4. At these conditions the 
α-amylase was no longer active (data not shown). During saccharification, just as in the 
liquefaction process a lower dosage of enzyme was used to facilitate a gradual 
hydrolysis. As th e optimum conditions for glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger  were 
reached, 0.023 w/w% of enzyme was added and the reaction was followed for 25 hours. 
According to Cepeda et al. (2001) , 0.05 w/w% of enzyme would facilitate the 95% 
conversion of a suspension of 30 w/w% starch within 24 hours at 60°C. Thus we would 
have to d ouble the dosage of enzyme and maintain a constant enzyme to substrate ratio 
if our goal would have been the complete conversion within 24 hours; however this was 
not the case.  
Samples were taken regularly during the reaction, transferred into Eppendorf 
tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen to terminate the reaction. The methods for sample 
treatment and the analysis of the carbohydrate composition were as described earlier 
(chapters 2, 3 and 4).  
5.3.3. Modelling  
5.3.3.1.   Liquefaction model  
The liquefaction  model was fitted with the data from starch liquefaction at high 
dry matter contents and also used to create the substrate matrices (inputs) for the 
saccharification model. The starting DE value s of the saccharification samples at each 
substrate concentrat ion were  used as an indicator for the end point of the liquefaction in 
Chapter 5  
100  the model ( Table 5.2 ). The DE, being the degree of conversion, was found by adjusting 
the timespan of the model. The model timespan is a measure of the number of reaction 
events occurri ng in the model, and therefore can be compared to the time of the 
reaction. However, since not all reaction events lead to hydrolysis the relation between 
the number of reaction evens and the degree of conversion is not linear. The model 
timespan was varie d to create matrices of hydrolysed starch (maltodextrins) composed 
of molecules that are distributed similarly to the hydrolysates in the experiments.  
5.3.3.2.   Saccharification model  
The saccharification model follows the same outlines as the liquefacti on model. 
To create the model the basics of the subsite theory for depolymerizing enzymes were 
applied ( Thoma et al. (1970) ; (1971 ), Hiromi (1970) , Hiromi et al. (1973) , (1976a ; 
1976b )). In short, subsites constitute the active site of enzymes and are locations where  
monomeric units of the substrate interact with the enzyme. Each subsite has a 
characteristic free energy of interaction with a glucose residue (MacGregor and 
MacGregor 1985 ). Binding of a substrate residue in a particular subsite can either cause 
the total free binding energy of enzyme -substrate (E -S) complex to increase (when the 
subsite binding energy is negative) or to decrease (if the binding energy of a subsite is 
positive) by the value assigned to the subsite (Besselink et al. 2008 )). Subsites act 
independently, meaning that binding at one subsite will not affect the free energy of 
interaction in the neighbouring site (MacGregor and MacGregor 1985 ). 
Based on t he subsite theory, the association constant of the E -S complex ( Kn) can 
be calculated using the binding energies of the subsites occupied by the substrate 
residues. The relationship between the association constant ( Kn) and the subsite 
affinities ( Ai) or free energy of binding ( ∆Gi) of occupied subsites is summarized in the 
equation:  
𝐾𝑛=exp ∑𝐴𝑖𝑐𝑜𝑣
𝑖
𝑅𝑇 =exp −∑∆𝐺𝑖𝑐𝑜𝑣
𝑖
𝑅𝑇

Modelling liquefact ion and saccharification at high substrate concentrations  
101  With this equation one can calculate the association constants ( Kn) of a particular 
substrate molecule ( DP n) with the enzyme. The ratio of the Kn of an E -S complex an d the 
association constant ( Kmax) - calculated with the most negative value of binding energy 
possible, determines the chance of hydrolysis. If the formed E -S complex overlaps the 
catalytic site, hydrolysis will occur provided the chance of hydrolysis is l arger than a 
random number between 0 and 1 (Besselink et al. 2008 ). 
The first step in creating a stochastic model for saccharification is to describe the 
mode of action of a gluco amylase. The cleavage site described in the saccharification 
model is different than in the liquefaction model, because α -amylase (endoenzyme) 
hydrolyses bonds within the chain of starch, and glucoamylase (exoenzyme) hydrolyses 
the α -(1,4) -glycosidic bonds  of the non -reducing end glucose unit. A saccharification 
model is therefore simpler than the model of liquefaction, since only one type of 
products (glucose) can be formed.  
Second, not all bonds can be hydrolysed by glucoamylase. The part of the model 
defining the limitations of the enzyme is crucial, because glucoamylase can only detach 
the non -reducing end glucose units. The smallest DP of the substrate to be hydrolysed is 
thus set to 2, leaving glucose as the only product that cannot be hydrolysed. The α-(1,4) -
bonds near a branch (an α -(1,6) -linkage) can be hydrolysed, but the hydrolysis of the 
branch itself is not permitted.  
A number of subsite maps of Aspergillus niger  glucoamylase have been reported 
(Table 5.1 ), using mostly isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOS) or maltooligosaccharides 
(MOS) as substrates for subsite mapping ( Ermer et al. (1993) , Meagher et al. (1989) , Ono 
et al. (1988) , Stoffer et al. (1997) ). Based on our previous reports (chapters 3 and 4) and 
those of Ermer et al. (1993)  or Meagher et al. (1989) , the type of substrate used to create 
the subsite map influences the energy values of the subsites. Therefore some of the 
presented subsite maps might not allow for accurate predictions of the reactio n 
products obtained with our specific substrate. The subsite maps we found were 
determined at different reaction conditions, but we kept the temperature in the model at 
60°C (333K), as it was the optimal temperature used in our experiments.  
We applied the principles of parsimony (van Boekel 2008 ) to limit the number of 
parameters in the model, and decided to keep the simulation as simple as possible by 
using the following assumptions:  
Chapter 5  
102   No reversed reactions take place,  
 Mass transfer limitations a re not included,  
 Molecules of all sizes can be hydrolysed with the same rate (Ermer et al. 1993 ), 
 No inhibition is implemented, including the inhibition caused by a branch point 
(an α -(1,6) -glycosidic bond).

Both the liquefaction and the saccharification model assume that only one 
molecule of enzyme is attacking any particular substrate molecule at the same time, 
which reflects the ex perimental conditions with the concentration of the substrate being 
much higher than that of the enzyme (Nakatani 1996 ). 
The comparison between the model outputs and the data was possible by 
converting the model time into experimental time. This was done using non -linear 
fitting, based on the expectation that non -productive encounters between the enzyme 
and the substrate last nearly three times shorter than the productive ones 
(Wojciechowski et al. 2001 ). The procedure included only the experimental DE values 
and the time intervals at which they were measured and used all of the DE data point s. 
Thus, the model incorporates the enzyme concentration and the influence of the

5.4. Results and discussion  
5.4.1. Gelatinization and hydrolysis at low moisture contents  
After the thermo -mechanical treatment the gelatinized sample s were compared 
to native starch samples under a microscope. The lack of granular structure in the 
gelatinized samples indirectly confirms that the gelatinization process was complete 
(not shown).  
Increasing the substrate concentration (30 -60%) and keepin g the enzyme 
concentration constant during the liquefaction of wheat starch resulted in a lower 
reaction rate. In all cases, the reaction was still in an initial phase when it was 
terminated. As a result, the concentrations of DP 1 -4 (Figure 5.1 ) were rela tively low (<5 
w/w%). The profiles of products were not that different at higher substrate 
concentrations, compared with data at low substrate concentrations. Baks et al. ( 2008)  
found that even as the concentration of starch is increased, the final product profiles (< 
DP 8) do not change, even though the final DE reached within the same time is 
somewhat lower. We observed similar effects in our liquefaction samples ( Table  5.2, 
Figure 5.1 ). Baks et al. (2008)  concluded that the concentration of substrate does not 
influence the selectivity of the enzyme. Additionally, the enzy me was more s table when 
starch wa s hydrolysed at higher substrate concentrations (50 -70%), since BLA  still 
remained active after several hours at low moisture contents.  
The liquefaction samples containing 30 w/w% dry matter were hydrolysed most 
extensively, with the h ighest quantities of maltotriose (DP3), maltotetraose (DP4) and 
DP 5 -8 (Figure 5.1 , empty bars). A similar DE value of samples in both experiments at 50 
and 60 w/w% dry matter reflects a similar distribution of the hydrolysis products, both 
oligo - and poly saccharides. At 40 w/w%, a lot of the large polysaccharide groups 
remained present after 5 hours despite the higher DE value, and similar amounts of 
oligosaccharides were produced to those at the higher starch concentrations.  
 
 
Chapter 5  
104  5.4.2. Modelling of liquefaction by BLA  
Modelling of wheat starch hydrolysis by BLA at low substrate concentrations 
(10%) showed that the model results were especially influenced by the binding energy 
values in the subsite map and by the inhibition in the model (chapters 3 an d 4). In the 
liquefaction model for the higher starch concentrations, we used the subsite map at 80°C 
that we reported earlier (chapter 4). The three branch factors (determining the intensity 
of inhibition) were given values of 0.03 to express the low rate s of hydrolysis at high 
substrate concentrations.  
 
Figure  5.1. The final composition (w/w%) of starch liquefacts from the experimental hydrolysis at 5h 
(empty bars with black outline) compared with the final outputs of the liquefaction model (filled grey  
bars). The total values of the residuals (SRSS) at each substrate concentration were 223, 219, 219 and 265 
for 30, 40, 50 and 60 w/w% respectively.  
The predictions of the liquefaction model corresponded well with the 
experimental data at the end of the r eaction ( Figure 5.1 ). Despite the increase in the 
initial substrate concentration of the samples, the subsite map allowed for accurate 
predictions of the oligosaccharides. Most differences between the model and the data 
appeared in the concentrations of th e larger polysaccharides. At 30, 50 and 60 w/w% 
the groups of DP 81 -180, 181 -350 and 451 -700 were predicted least accurately. At 40 
w/w% the predictions of DP 16 -35 and 181 -350 were least accurate. The former was 

Modelling liquefact ion and saccharification at high substrate concentrations  
105  also an issue at 60 w/w%. Since the model a nd the experimental data at all 
concentrations were in fairly good agreement, we concluded that we could use the 
created model matrices of maltodextrins as the substrate for the glucoamylase model.

5.4.3. Modelling of saccharification by glucoamylase  
5.4.3.1.   Subsite maps of A. niger glucoamylase  
Some of the independently obtained subsite maps  of A niger  glucoamyla se that 
are reported in literature are similar. Based on the similarities between the subsite maps 
given in Table 5.1  we categorised them into two major groups: the ‘older’ subsite maps 
(Meagher et al. (1989) , Ono et al. (1988 )) and the ‘newer’ subsite maps ( Ermer et al. 
(1993) , Stoffer et al. (1997) ).  
In the ‘olde r’ subsite maps, subsite -1 is assigned a positive binding energy value 
and the remaining subsites are given negative energy values. In the subsite maps created 
using maltooligosaccharides ( Meagher et al. (1989) , Ono et al. (1 988) ) subsite +1 has a 
high negative value (on average -20 kJ·mol-1), and is followed by a relatively high 
negative value assigned to subsite +2 (on average -6.6 kJ·mol-1). The subsite maps of 
Meagher et al. (1989)  based on isomaltooligos accharides, differ by having higher 
positive energy value of subsite -1 and less negative value of subsites +1 and +2. In all 
the ‘older’ subsite maps, the binding modes that result in the lowest energy of binding 
do not overlap the catalytic site. This su ggests that a large number of non -productive 
complexes might be formed in the model and fewer E -S bindings will result in the 
production of glucose (i.e. hydrolysis).  
In the ‘newer’ subsite maps, nearly all subsites are assigned negative binding 
energy val ues. Binding modes covering the catalytic site are more probable in these 
subsite maps, because of the negative energy values of subsite -1. One of the subsite

106  maps of Ermer et al. (1993)  and the subsite map of Stoffer et al. (1997)  (both based on 
maltooligosaccharides) show large si milarities. These subsite maps are analogous with 
the ‘older’ subsite maps, but mainly differ in the negative energy value assigned to 
subsite -1. The remaining subsite map of Ermer et al. (1993)  does not show similarities 
to any of the discussed categories, perhaps because i t was obtained using a different 
type of substrate.  
Table  5.3. The average subsite maps used in the model based on the subsite maps from Table 5.1 . The 
references point to the source of the subsite maps used to calculate these average subsite maps.   
 
The model substrate matrices that were prepared with the liquefaction model for 
a specific concentration, were used as input for all simulations  of that one substrate 
concentration. With the large number of subsite maps available we decided to test the 
diffe rent subsite maps in groups to verify whether they result in reliable predictions 
(Table  5.3). The glucose concentrations predicted by the model using the average 
subsite maps (Table 5.3) are shown in Figure 5.2 .  
As expected, the positive energy values as signed to subsite -1 in the subsite maps 
SM 1 and SM 2 imply that more non -productive complexes are formed in the model. To 
reach a DE of 75, each simulation requires around 66,000 productive complexes, but at 
that stage the number of non -productive comple xes increases from just above a 1.2·106 
for SM 3, up to 3.6·106 for SM 1 and even 6·106 for SM 2. The binding modes that overlap 
the catalytic site have the highest values of total binding energy in subsite maps SM 1 
and SM 2 and are not favoured by the mo del. When subsite maps SM 1 and SM 2 are 
used in the model, the concentration of glucose increases steadily, but within the given 
number of events it does not exceed 60 w/w% or 40 w/w%, respectively ( Figure 5.2 ). 
These subsite maps are therefore most likel y to result in inaccurate predictions. With all 
subsites assigned negative energy values, the subsite maps SM 3 and SM 4 allow for the 
highest concentration of glucose within the given number of hydrolysis events.

Figure  5.2 Outputs of the saccharificati on model computed using the maltodextrin matrix from the 
liquefaction model at 30% starch, with four average subsite maps from Table 5.3. Only the concentration 
of glucose is shown. The complete output is shown in the Appendix (Figure A1).  
Thus the use of  different substrates during subsite mapping of the enzyme 
influences the values of binding energies of the subsites, and therefore also the 
predictions of the product composition. If the aim of subsite mapping is to estimate the 
binding energies of the en zyme with its actual substrate (starch), then choosing the right 
kind of substrate for subsite mapping is crucial.  
5.4.3.2.   Saccharification model vs. the experimental data at 30 w/w% dry matter  
The model outputs of saccharification with the four subsite  maps from Table 5.3 
were fitted to the experimental data collected from starch hydrolysis at 30 w/w%. The 
accuracy of the predictions was evaluated using both the graphical outputs ( Figure 5.3 ) 
and the SRSS values (the Square Root of the Sum of Squares of  the residuals). For the 
model outputs that used subsite maps SM 1 and SM 2 the number of events in the model 
needed to be increased threefold as compared to the subsite maps SM 3 and SM 4 to 
compensate for the large number of non -productive events.

the experimental data and the lines represent the model simulations. Note: the plots in the first column

The saccharification model was very accurate. Repetitions of the simulation were 
nearly equal, because there was less randomness involved in only cleaving off the non -
reducing end glucose units, compared to the action of 𝛼-amylase during the liquefaction . 
The saccharification reaction always follows the same pattern, in which one of the 
products is always glucose, and the size of the residual substrate reduces by 1 DP. The 
liquefac tion model is different in this respect, because the large molecules can be

109  cleaved in a number of positions, leading to numerous possibilities and much larger 
product diversity between the simulations.  
Based solely on the graphical outputs in Figure 5.3 , reasonable fits between the 
data and the model are achieved with all of the subsite maps. The predictions of all 
molecules larger than DP 5 barely differ between the different subsite maps. It is 
somewhat surprising that the concentrations of maltose, mal totriose and maltotetraose 
(Figure 5.3  B, F, J and N) in the model vary more than the concentrations of glucose. For 
example, the more negative binding energies assigned to subsites +2 and +3 in SM 4 are 
responsible for the differences in concentrations of  glucose, maltose and maltotriose 
between the simulations with subsite maps SM 3 and SM 4. The model outputs using SM 
3 and SM 4 will resemble each other more, if the energy values assigned to subsites +2 
and +3  in SM 4 are proportionally more similar to the values of the same subsites in SM 
3, e.g., – 3.3 and -1 kJ·mol-1 respectively. The concentration of glucose will then increase 
and the amounts of maltose and maltotriose produced by the model will decrease.

The differences between the modelled and the experimental data (SRSS) in 
simulations using the four subsite  maps are given in Table 5.4 . SM 3 with the lowest 
total SRSS of 249 is the subsite map allowing for the most accurate overall predictions. 
However, if the choice of the subsite map was based solely on the ability of the model to 
predict the concentration of glucose, subsite map SM 4 would be more accurate. The

110  more inaccurate predictions of maltose and maltotriose ( Figure 5.3 N) increase the total 
residuals with subsite map SM 4.  
The residuals of the model outputs with SM 1 and SM 3 are similar. The worse  fit 
of DP 2, DP 3 and DP 4 with SM 1 is also evident in the higher total SRSS than that of the 
model using SM 3. The subsite map SM 2, although based on isomaltooligosaccharides, 
also allows for accurate predictions. The predicted concentrations of maltos e and 
maltotriose are more alike the experimental data with this subsite map, however they 
are offset by the worse fit of glucose.  
Based on the comparison of all the average subsite maps with the saccharification 
data form experiments at 30 w/w% dry matte r content, subsite map SM 3 is most 
optimal, as it allows for most accurate predictions of the model and results in the lowest 
total value of SRSS.   
5.4.3.3.   Saccharification model and experiments at higher substrate concentrations  
Subsite map 3 yields the most accurate predictions when the data from 
experiments at 40, 50 and 60 w/w% of starch are compared with the model outputs 
using the same four groups of subsite maps from Table 5.3.

At 40 w/w% substrate the saccharification reaction proceeds at a similar initial 
rate as at 30 w/w% or 50 w/w% of substrate ( Table 5.2 ). The reaction rates of the three 
experiments deviate as the hydrolysis progresses, leading to differences in final

Modelling liquefact ion and saccharification at high substrate concentrations  
111  concentrations of glucose at each substrate concentration, with the highest glucose 
concentration reached at 40 w/w% starch ( Table  5.2). Even though in the beginning of 
the reaction the concentration of maltose is quite high in our samples (even up to 15 
w/w% at 40 w/w% dry matter), as the reaction progresses maltose is being hydrolysed 
and only around 5 w/w% of maltose remains when the reaction is stopped ( Figure 5.4 
B). Comparing the results with SM 3 to the experimental data at 40 w/w% ( Figure 5.4  A-
D) the total SRSS was equal to 231 ( Table 5.5 ).  
At 50 w/w% of starch, we observe a high initial reaction rate, but the reaction 
quick ly slows down. The DE value reached at the end of the reaction is a third lower 
than the DE at 30 w/w% ( Figure 5.3 ) or 40 w/w% ( Figure 5.4 ). The lower rate of the 
reaction also reflects in the gradual hydrolysis of the largest molecules available for the 
enzyme in the mixture ( Figure 5.4  G and H). The benefit of hydrolysis at 50 w/w% dry 
matter is that less maltose is formed in the reaction, which can result in a better yield of 
glucose if the reaction continues towards higher degree of conversion.  
At 50 w /w% the system starts to behave differently. The reaction rate decreases, 
leading to long reaction times, while the concentrated, very viscous reaction mixture 
makes reproducible sampling complicated. However, the model using the SM 3 also at 
this substrat e concentration predicts the products reasonably well. The total SRSS of 
251 is reached when the model is fitted with the data of the 50 w/w% starch 
saccharification. The fit is less accurate compared with the experiments at other 
substrate concentrations (Table 5.5 ), because of discrepancies with the larger 
saccharides. However, the production of glucose, maltotriose (DP 3) and maltotetraose 
(DP 4) is predicted satisfactorily.  
When an even higher amount of substrate is used during hydrolysis (60 w/w%) 
the reaction remains in the initial stage within the given time. The hydrolysis begins 
slowly at these conditions, with an initial reaction rate 10 times lower than in the other 
saccharification experiments. However, at 25 hours the dextrose equivalent reache s 
nearly the same value as at 50 w/w% starch, and the final glucose concentration is even 
higher than at 50 w/w% ( Table 5.2 ). The rates of reaction reported by Curic et al. (1998)  
varied little when the substrate concentration was increased from 45 to 60 w/w%, but 
we do not observe this. The reaction rate clearly decreases as starch concentration 
increases from 50 to 60 w/w%.

representing the experimental data and the lines representing the model simulations. Note: the plots in 
the first column have a different scale and represent both glucose concentration and the DE.  
The results of  van der Veen et al. (2005)  show that lower glucose concentrations 
and a hig her final degree of polymerization of products are common at increased dry 
matter contents. In our experiments, the glucose concentration decreases as the 
substrate concentration increases above 40 w/w%, but the other products (maltose, 
isomaltose, maltotr iose) appear in lower quantities. Maltose and isomaltose are 
generally undesired products in the production of glucose syrup as they can decrease 
the final yield of glucose. The model predictions of maltose do not agree very well with 
the experimental data : most subsite maps allow for higher maltose production in the 
model than in the experiments ( Figure 5.3  B, F, J , N).  
The experimental DE values that are obtained at the different substrate 
concentrations drop from nearly 80 at 30 and 40 w/w% of substrate  to 55 and 50 for 50 
and 60 w/w% of substrate, respectively. The model of van der Veen et al. (2006)  

Modelling liquefact ion and saccharification at high substrate concentrations  
113  proposed that the DE values are similar at all substrate concentrations (35 -65%) after 
24 hours of the reaction. Clearly, high DE values in the experiments at low moisture 
contents can only be reached at very long reaction times,  or at high enzyme 
concentrations with a constant enzyme to substrate ratio. For our kinetic experiments it 
is better to work at a constant enzyme concentration, which is different from 
experiments where the goal is to reach the highest possible conversion . 
Despite the differences in the rate of glucose production and in the final DE 
values, the model predicts the results of the experimental hydrolysis at 60 w/w% of 
starch quite well ( Figure 5.4  I-L). Both the gradual degradation of the large substrates 
and the less rapid build -up of glucose are well described by the saccharification model. 
The model fits the data reasonably well, resulting in a low total SRSS value ( Table 5.5 ).  
Both the subsite map of Ermer et al. (1993)  and that of Stoffer et al. (1997)  were  
developed using maltooligosaccharides (DP < 9) as substrates. The maltodextrin derived 
from starch by enzymatic liquefaction are similar substrates to their 
maltooligosaccharides, with the addition of some larger, branched molecules. Based on 
our data, th e maltooligosaccharides are relevant substrates for the estimation of binding 
energies of glucoamylases’ subsites. In addition, using the same set of binding energy 
values we were able to predict the product distribution during hydrolysis with 
glucoamylase  at different initial substrate concentrations.  
The binding energies in the subsite map of BLA are assumed to be dependent on 
the temperature of the reaction (Kandra et al. 2006 ). It is not clear whether that is also 
the case for glucoamylase. The subsite mapping experiments of Ermer et al. (1993)  and 
Stoffer et al. (1997)  were conducted at 25 and 45°C respectively. It is likely that these 
authors used the same enzyme and thus came to nearly the same values of binding 
energies, irrespective of the 20°C temperature difference. We could successfully use 
these values for our predictions at 60°C, which shows that the energies in the subsite 
maps of glucoamylase from Aspergillus  niger  might not be strongly dependent on  the 
temperature. Therefore, the conclusions from the hydrolysis by α -amylase form Bacillus 
licheniformi s (chapter 4) that the binding energies do not differ substantially at different 
reaction temperatures, can be generalized to the glucoamylase  originating  from 
Aspergillus niger .

114  5.5. Conclusions  
The liquefaction and saccharification products in time during hydrolysis of wheat 
starch at high dry matter contents were predicted using a stochastic model based on the 
subsite theory. With more subsite maps emerging in literature and new methods 
available to estimate the binding energies ( Gyémánt et al. (2002) ; Mótyán et al. (2011) ), 
our models will become more and more useful in predicting the outcome of hydrolysis 
and thereby characterizing the mechanisms of the enzymes in more detail, even under 
extreme reaction conditions.  
The saccharification m odel predicts the hydrolysis products without obtaining 
numerous parameters, but does not need inclusion of inhibition and condensation 
reactions, or restriction to specific conditions, e.g., enzyme concentrations. The 
hydrolysis products can be predicted by the model based solely on the subsite map. Also, 
by fitting just the values of DE in time, the composition of the products over time can be 
predicted.  
Although both models were applied to completely gelatinized samples, we expect 
that these models can also predict the outcomes of reactions taking place at any enzyme -
substrate ratio, and at any substrate concentration. The changes of the reaction 
conditions will reflect in the DE, which is used for fitting of the carbohydrate 
concentrations, and therefor e are included in the model.

Chapter 6  
120  6.1. Outline of the thesis  
The aim of the work described in this thesis was to create stochastic models that 
simulate the full extent of enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat starch. By comparing how 
wheat starch hydrolysis products develop over time at different experimental 
conditions, w e also explored the mechanisms of the two industrially relevant enzymes 
used in starch processing: α -amylase form Bacillus licheniformis  (BLA) and glucoamylase 
from Aspergillus niger . 
In chapters 2, 3 and 4 the model that simulates the concentrations of al l the 
hydrolysis products is described. In chapter 2 we discussed the gradual hydrolysis of 
wheat starch by the α -amylase (BLA) at 50°C. We confirmed that the reaction products 
do not appear in a random manner, but that they are the result of both the acti on pattern 
of the enzyme and the structure of the substrate. Subsequently, we described the 
stochastic model simulating the decomposition of starch into all of the hydrolysis 
products. The parameters available in literature were not adequate in accurately 
predicting the experimental product composition.  
In chapter 3 we examined in detail whether by developing a new subsite map we 
were able to predict the products of starch hydrolysis at 50°C. We looked into the energy 
values assigned to each subsite to fin d out how the binding energy influences the 
simulated products. Subsites that are most relevant for accurate predictions were 
selected and their energy values were changed accordingly. As the subsite maps mostly 
influence the small hydrolysis products (< D P 8), we concluded that inhibition is the 
parameter that influences the hydrolysis of the large molecules in the solution. After 
testing several branch factors, we chose the set that resulted in the best fit between the 
modelled and experimentally collecte d data from chapter 2.  
Wheat starch liquefaction at 80°C is described in chapter 4. First, the changes in 
product composition during the hydrolysis reaction were discussed. All the hydrolysis 
products were then simulated using the subsite map taken from Kandra et al. (2006) , 
again  showing a poor fit with the experimental data. Just as in chapter 3, a new subsite 
map and a set of branch factors were derived. Despite the differences in temperature, 
the interactions within the active site were not as different as  the results of Kandra et al. 
(2006)  might sugge st.  
General discussion  
121  After demonstrating that liquefaction of starch can be accurately described with 
the model at two different temperatures, the liquefaction at low moisture contents was 
studied. In chapter 5 we used the liquefaction model, with the parameters developed  in 
chapter 4, to predict the composition of starch hydrolysates after 5 hours of hydrolysis 
at 30, 40, 50 and 60 w/w% of dry matter. The model results were compared with 
hydrolysis data, showing good agreement. However, the main focus of chapter 5 was to 
describe a stochastic model that can predict the products of the next step in starch 
hydrolysis – the saccharification. The maltodextrins produced during wheat starch 
liquefaction by BLA, were further hydrolysed with a glucoamylase from Aspergillus 
niger . Using the saccharification model, we tested several subsite maps found in 
literature and chose the one that best describes the data. The concentration of all 
hydrolysis products during the course of complete hydrolysis of starch could be well 
described usi ng a single type of model.  
 
In the next section, we will discuss the method for optimisation of the parameters 
of the liquefaction model that we used in chapter 5. After a motivation of the choice of 
the subsite map and inhibition values, we will verify o ur liquefaction model with 
independently collected data. Experimental data from literature, that represent wheat 
starch liquefaction by α -amylases from Bacillus licheniformis  (BLA) at 5 and 60 w/w% of 
substrate and α -amylases from Bacillus amyloliquefacien s (BAA) at 5 w/w% of substrate, 
will be used to verify our choice of model parameters and the method used for their 
optimization. Further on, factors affecting the saccharification of maltodextrins at low 
moisture content will be discussed. We will conclud e this chapter by describing the 
potential of mechanistic modelling and the applications of the models that we 
developed.  
6.2. The liquefaction model at low moisture contents  
In chapter 5 only the final results of the liquefaction model at different initi al 
substrate concentrations were shown. The liquefaction model was used mainly to 
simulate the matrix representing the maltodextrins, which was used as the substrate for 
the saccharification model. Here we demonstrate how the parameters chosen for the 
liquefaction model at low substrate concentrations (subsite map, branch factors) were 
Chapter 6  
122  evaluated for each of the experiments at increased dry matter content (30, 40, 50 and 60 
w/w%).  
The liquefaction model at 80°C (chapter 4) was adapted to predict starch 
hydro lysis products at higher dry matter concentrations (chapter 5). The timespan of 
the model was shortened (Table 5.2 in chapter 5). With a shorter timespan the reaction 
in the model reached the same final dextrose equivalent (DE) as the experimental data 
at each substrate concentration.  
The results at low substrate concentrations (10 w/w%) were influenced by the 
binding energy values of the subsite map and by the inhibition (chapter 3, 4). The best 
subsite maps and branch factors from chapter 4 were tested ag ainst the experimental 
data from hydrolysis at high substrate contents (30 -60 w/w%). With the low 
concentrations of DP 1 -4 (<5 w/w%) and the large molecules being hydrolysed 
gradually, we expected that the branch factors would have more impact than the sub site 
map, since the inhibition is the major determinant of the hydrolysis of larger 
polysaccharides. Every stochastic simulation was executed five times and the average 
model output was compared with the experimental data using graphical outputs and the 
square root of the residual sums of squares (SRSS).  
6.2.1.  Subsite maps  
The model with the original subsite map of BLA at 80°C (Kandra et al. 2006 ) 
could not correctly predict the composition of starch hydrolysates (chapter 4). However, 
the agreement between the predicted DP 1 -8 and DP 1 -8 from the experimental data 
(chapter 4) when using this subsite map was quite accurate in the initial stages of the 
reaction (< 1h). T o ensure better description of the experiments during the whole 
observed reaction time, we changed the energy values of five subsites. Increasing the 
binding energy values of subsites -5 (from -11.2 to -7 kJ·mol-1) and +3 (from -7.2 to -1 
kJ·mol-1) substan tially improved the predictions of the model and led to more accurate 
results. Three additional smaller changes in the binding energies of subsite -4, -3 and +4 
resulted in the final new subsite map (referred to as SM 1). Both subsite maps, the 
original one and SM 1, were used in the liquefaction model and compared with the data 
from starch hydrolysis at 30, 40, 50 and 60 w/w%.  
General discussion  
123  Table 6.1 A comparison of the model predictions using two subsite maps: SM 1 and Org – the original 
subsite map of Kandra et al. (2006) . The average values o f SRSS are given. The simulations were repeated 
five times with branch factors set to 0.05.  
 
The simulations with the original subsite map predicted the outcomes of 
hydrolysis at high dry matter contents better than at 10 w/w% substrate concentrations 
(chapter 4). Despite a satisfactory description of the experimental data, the predictions 
using the original subsite map were not as good as the predictions using the new subsite 
map (SM 1). For all the starch concentrations, the lower residuals of DP 2 and DP 9 -15 
(Table 6.1) summed up to lower total SRSS values. Only at 50 w/w% the total SRSS’s 
were similar, because the predictions of DP 5 -8 were less accurate at this substrate 
concentration when SM 1 was used.  
The predictions of DP 1 -8 could not be furthe r improved, however there was still 
potential for improvement in the predictions of the higher molecular weight 
polysaccharides. With the branch factors set to 0.05, the inadequate predictions of the 
large molecules, especially DP 16 -35, 36 -80 and 450 -700,  increased the total SRSS.  
6.2.2.  Inhibition (branch factors)  
At the initial stages of hydrolysis, with the abundance of large molecules, the 
enzyme easily attacks the large, accessible targets. Only small amounts of 
oligosaccharides were produced within t he reaction time we followed (Figure 6.1) and 
the energies assigned to the subsites will have less effect than the inhibition on the 
overall predictions.

124  The inhibition in the liquefaction model was based on the inability of the enzyme 
(BLA) to hydrolyse the α -(1,6) -glycosidic bonds and on the impairment of the hydrolysis 
when these bonds were in the proximity of the catalytic site. The inhibition influences 
the rate of hydrolysis indirectly, by increasing the frequency of non -productive 
hydrolysis events.  A decrease of the  values of the  branch factors leads to stronger 
inhibition in the model. More non -productive complexes are formed and the rate of 
hydrolysis will be lower.  
The influence of the branch factors on the model predictions during starch 
hydroly sis at 80°C was not as pronounced as in the outputs of the model at 50°C. As long 
as the branch factors were given values of 0.1 or less, the predictions of the hydrolysis 
model at 80°C were close to the trends of the experimental data. For our analyses at  
increased substrate concentrations, we designed  the values of 0.1, 0.07, 0.05 and 0.03 to 
the branch factors with each of the subsite maps (Table 6.2). As the values of the branch 
factors decreased, the fit of the model improved (Table 6.2). Based on the SRSS values 
alone, the branch factors needed to be set to 0.03, as then the differences between the 
model and the data were the smallest for every starch concentration.  
Table 6.2. Total SRSS values of computations using different branch factor values with  two subsite maps 
(SM1 and the original subsite map) and for all of the substrate concentrations. The values in bold mark the 
lowest SRSS per experiment.  
 
The SRSS values given in Table 6.2 indicated that, in all but one case, the best 
agreements between the model and the experimental data was found with branch 
factors set to 0.03 and with SM 1. At 50 w/w% the two subsite maps yielded nearly 
identical results for each set of branch factors, and difference can only be discerned

Figure 6.1  Outputs of the liquefaction model (lines) plotted against the experimental data (points) from 
starch hydrolysis by BLA at 80°C and at: (A -D) 30 w/w%; (E -H) 40 w/w%; (I -L) 50 w/w%; and (M -P) 60 
w/w% of dry matter. Subsite map SM 1 and branch factors of 0.03 were used duri ng simulations.  
when the branch factors were set to 0.03. This was a result of a better fit of DP 351 -450 
in the computations using the original subsite map. The new subsite map (SM 1) 
described the oligosaccharides better at each substrate concentration, and therefore we 
graphically show the results of the model with SM 1 (Figure 6.1) and the branch factors 
set to 0.03. The differences between the experimental data sets at the four substrate 
concentrations were rather small, and the model fitted all data sets. With the branch 
factors set to 0.03, the somewhat lower concentrations of D P 16 -35, 36 -80, 81 -180 

Chapter 6  
126  predicted by the model correspond better with the experimental data (Figure 6.1) than 
at higher values of branch factors.  
The final output of the liquefaction model was used as the substrate for the 
saccharification model. The plots  in Figure 6.1 show that in the final stage of hydrolysis 
the model and the experimental data lead to similar outcomes. This implies that the 
maltodextrin matrices resulting from the liquefaction model are a good representation 
of the saccharification subs trates.  
6.3.   Testing the liquefaction model and its parameters with independently collected data  
The goal of our model was the simulation of all hydrolysis products, and 
therefore we chose a carbohydrate analysis method that identified and quantified 
molecules of all sizes. The method, however, had more limitations than the model we 
designed. The model can of course distinguish the molecules with a difference of 1 DP, 
and even differentiate between branched and linear products. An analytical method able 
to distinguish such subtle differences between the products, would be necessary to fully 
test our model. However, such detailed separation was not possible to achieve with the 
analysis method (HPLC -SEC) and the column we chose.   
HPLC -SEC does allow the ana lysis of all the hydrolysis products, at the cost of a 
somewhat lower resolution. Additionally, the size -exclusion method separates on the 
apparent molecular weight, and cannot resolve between linear and branched molecules 
with the same degree of polymeriz ation. Separation methods achieving higher 
resolution are available (e.g., HPAEC), but most of them fail to analyse larger polymeric 
molecules.  
The composition of small oligosaccharides produced during wheat starch 
hydrolysis by BLA has been examined before ( Baks et al. (2008) , Besselink et al. (2008) ) 
at a higher resolution.  This allowed us to test the subsite maps we developed against 
these independently collected hydrolysis data.  
6.3.1.  Starch hydrolysis by BLA at 5 w/w% of substrate  
Besselink et al. (2008)  used the subsite map proposed by Kandra et al. (2006)  in 
their predictions of hydrolysis products (DP 1 -7) from 5 w/w% wheat starch hydrolysis 
by BLA at 50°C. The simulations were not accurate for any of the seven oligosaccharides. 
General discussion  
127  Besselink et al. (2008)  proposed a single change – the energy of subsite +3 was set to 0, 
which somewhat improved the predictions of DP 1, 2, 3 and 4.  
The fit of th e modelled oligosaccharides with the data by Besselink et al. (2008)  
(Figure 6.2 A-C) was not as good as with our own data in chapter 3. Our reaction took 
place at  a higher substrate concentration (10 w/w% instead of 5 w/w%), but with the 
same enzyme dosage. At these conditions the conversion did not exceed a DE of 20, 
whereas Besselink et al. (2008)  reached a much higher final DE (35). In addition, we did 
not separately consider the concentrations of DP 5, 6 and 7 when choosing the final 
subsite map. Yet, till the DE of 20 (90 minutes of the reaction), the predictions using  our 
subsite map correspond well with the experimental data. The predictions of some of the 
oligosaccharides begin to deviate from the experimental data by Besselink  et al. (2008) , 
at conversions larger than we considered in our own experiments.

50°C compared with the model simulations using: (A -C) the new subsite map (chapter 3); (D -F) an 
updated subsite map for 50°C.  
As we have tested a number of possible subsite maps b efore we applied the one 
given in chapter 3, we  could now compare  the model results using some of those subsite 

Chapter 6  
128  maps with the data of Besselink et al. (2008) . The  key to a better description of the data 
by the model was in a decreased production of DP 4 and slower hydrolysis of DP 5, 6,  7.

The new subsite map developed in chapter 3 is shown, along with its updated version that better 
describes the data at higher degree of conversion. The changed binding energies are given in bold  
 
The subsite map that predicted the data of Besselink et al. (2008)  best (Figure 6.2 
D-F) did not differ substantially from the one we originally proposed (Table 6.3 and 
Table 6.4). To reduce the concentratio n of DP 4 the energy of subsite -4 has to be less 
negative ( -4 kJ·mol-1 instead of -8 kJ·mol-1). Initially we decreased the energy value of 
that subsite, because in the beginning of the hydrolysis, the concentration of 
maltotetraose was more accurately pre dicted (also visible in Figure 6.2 B). Additionally 
we increased the energy of subsite +3 from -3 kJ·mol-1 to -1 kJ·mol-1, to compensate for 
the increase in the concentration of DP 3 that occurs after the change in subsite -4.

model computations using the new subsite map we proposed in Chapter 3 or the updated version of the 
subsite map, more suitable based on extensively hydrolysed wheat starch.  
 
The conc entrations of DP 1 -4 (Figure 6.2 E) were predicted nearly quantitatively 
with the model using the updated subsite map. However, in the first 2 hours of the 
reaction (DE < 25), DP 4 fitted less accurately with the changed subsite map. This was 
the reason wh y we previously did not consider this subsite map as most optimal. The 
concentrations of DP 5 -7 (Figure 6.2 F) were not predicted quantitatively, but the shapes 
of the curves and the proportions of DP 5 to DP 6 to DP 7 were as in the experimental

129  data. Cha nging the energy values of subsites did not improve the predictions of these 
groups anymore.  
The lack of further improvement in the predictions of DP 5, 6 and 7 by subsite 
map changes may also convey that the increased production of these oligosaccharides 
was the result of transglycosylation. Another reason can be the structure of the subsite 
map itself. Recently, the presence of an additional subsite on the glycone side of the 
subsite map, subsite -6, was suggested by Tran et al. (2014) . The predictions for DP 6 
might be more accurate if one more subsite was considered.  
We conclud e, that an accurate subsite map can be obtained when the data are 
hydrolysed more extensively, reaching a higher DE value. Additionally, measurements of 
the extent of transglycosylation during the reaction could improve the choice of the 
subsite map.  
6.3.2. Starch hydrolysis at 60 w/w% dry matter by BLA  
Baks et al. (2008)  hydrolysed 60 w/w% wheat starch at 90°C using BLA with an 
enzyme -to-substrate ratio of 0.1% (six -fold higher BLA concentration than in our 
analyses in Chapter 5). The composition of the oligosaccharides (DP 1 -7) was analysed 
with a higher resolution. Our liquefaction model with the subsite maps at 80°C and 
100°C (Kandra et al. 2006 ), and our new subsite map for 80°C from chapter 4 (Table 4.5) 
were compared to the data by Baks et al. (2008)  in Figure 6.3.

chapter 4.  
The graphical representation of the model results (Figur e 6.3) and the SRSS 
values (Table 6.6) both confirm that our new subsite map allows for more accurate 
predictions of the oligosaccharides than the remaining two subsite maps. With the 
subsite maps of Kandra et al. (2006) , the final mixtures contain almost no glucose, the 
concentrat ions of DP 2 and 4 are too low and the concentrations of DP 3, 5, 6 and 7 are 
too high. The subsite map at 100°C results in better predictions than that of 80°C, 
because of the higher energy values of subsite -5 and lower of subsite +3 (Table 6.5). 
These a re also some of the changes we suggested for our subsite map at 80°C. The lack 

General discussion  
131  of glucose is the result of the very negative binding energy value ( -17.5 kJ·mol-1) 
assigned to the subsite +2 at 100°C.

80 and 100°C and the new subsite map  at 80°C  that  we proposed in chapter 4.  
 
As we showed before, small differences might apply to subsite maps at different 
temperatures, hence some room for improvement of the subsite map at 90°C remains. 
DP 4 and 5 are strongly influenced by the energy of subsite -5. Lowering the binding 
energy of  subsite -5 may further improve the predictions. However, this detracts in no 
way from the fact that our subsite map, although based on data obtained at a lower 
temperature and with lower resolution, simulates the concentrations of products more 
accurately .  
6.3.3.  Starch hydrolysis by BAA at 5 w/w% of substrate  
The method we described for predicting the product concentrations over time 
using the subsite map can also be used to assess the subsite maps found in literature. We 
used data collected by Besselink et al. (2008)  for α -amylase from Bacillus 
amyloliquefaciens  (BAA) and the available subsite maps of this enzyme ( Allen and 
Thoma (1976) , Mótyán et al. (2011) ). Besselink et al. (2008)  already showed that the 
energies assigned to subsites in the subsite map of Allen and Thoma (1976)  (Table 6.7) 
could not entirely predict th e composition of the starch hydrolysis products. Figure 6.4 
shows the computations using the subsite map of Allen and Thoma (1976)  along wit h 
the outputs of the model with the subsite map given by Mótyán et al. (2011) . Mótyán et 
al. (2011)  suggested a different combination of subsites, with an extra subsite on the 
non-reducing end side and lack of the barrier site in subsite +4 (Table 6.7).

that we propose.  
 
The predictions based on the subsite map developed by Mótyán et al. (2011) , 
were more inaccurate for all oligosaccharides, except for DP 3 and 4 (Figure 6.4 F-H), 
than the predictions using the subsite map of Allen and Thoma (1976)  (Figure 6.4 B-D).  
In three simple steps, using the available subsite maps as initial guesses, we were 
able to find the subsites responsible for the inaccurate predi ctions and assign new 
energy values that allowed for better descriptions of the data. First, we looked at which 
oligosaccharides are predicted inaccurately and whether they are over - or 
underestimated by the model. Figure 6.4 shows that the new subsite map  should allow 
for higher production of glucose, maltose and maltotetraose as compared to both 
available subsite maps, but should also balance the concentrations of maltotriose. 
Maltopentaose, maltohexaose and maltoheptaose were predicted quite well by the 
subsite map of Allen and Thoma (1976) . Next, we compared the outputs using the 
available subsite maps and identified the subsites that will influence each of the 
oligosaccharides. Finally, we combined that information and, after just one attem pt, 
proposed a new subsite map (Table 6.7).  
We retained the positive energy value of subsite +4 in the new subsite map. This 
positive value along with the negative binding energies assigned to subsites +2 and +3 
allowed for improvement in predictions of D P 1, 3 and 4 (Figure 6.4 J, K). The energies 
assigned to subsites -4, -5 and -6 are crucial for the correct quantities of DP 4 through 7 
and remained unchanged. The small changes overall were sufficient for the model to 
show a similar trend to the experime ntal data, and in some cases close to quantitatively 
predict the hydrolysis products (DP 1, 3 and 7). The total SRSS values were now much 
lower (Table 6.8). The residuals of all of the oligosaccharides were lower than with the

134  another α -amylase relatively easily by applying the assumptions and reasoning we 
developed for BLA.  
The most accurate way of finding the energy values of a subsite map would be 
through multivariate analysis and simultaneous fitting of all the experimental data by 
minimizing the sum of squares. Despite our attempts, this was not possible to achieve o n 
a regular PC, as too many parameters and data values needed to be simultaneously 
taken into account. The approach we finally chose, based on insight in the function and 
influence of the different parameters, while not exactly giving the globally best fit  with 
the experiments, did lead us to conclusions others were not able to draw. One of these 
findings was the identification of the subsites that truly have an impact on the 
carbohydrate composition. We demonstrated that our model, method of obtaining the 
parameters and gathered insight from two hydrolases can easily be extended to new 
sets of experimental data and even other enzymes.  
6.4. Factors affecting saccharification at high substrate concentration  
Next to collecting experimental data to validate our models, we studied the 
hydrolysis process itself and looked into factors that might affect the hydrolysis reaction 
(Figure 6.5). Increasing the concentration of the substrate can have a substantial effec t 
on the progress of the reaction, as crowding of molecules and increased viscosity affects 
the mobility of the enzyme and its activity. The concentrated system as a whole is more 
prone to local differences caused by impaired mixing, including local low wa ter 
concentration or increased glucose concentration. This local increase in the 
concentration of the reaction products may increase local product inhibition and may 
lead to reversed reactions. Over time, the rate of the reaction decreases not only because  
the substrate depletes or the enzyme is inactivated, but also due to the accumulation of 
branches, which are hydrolysed at a much lower rate than the α -1,4-bonds.  
With a number of simple tests we show the influence of some of the discussed 
factors on the  concentration of products during saccharification by glucoamylase from A. 
niger . Some of these tests included commercial maltodextrins as substrates, since they 
are better soluble in water. Commercial maltodextrins were used as a model system for 
comparis on with our own samples.  
General discussion  
135   
Figure 6.5. A summary of factors influencing the hydrolysis of maltodextrins by glucoamylase.  
The influence of stirring speed on glucose production during hydrolysis of a 70 
w/w% maltodextrins solution shows that mixing influences the production of glucose 
(Figure 6.6). However, with less vigorous mixing more glucose is produced in the 
reaction. This effect was also noticed earlier by Miranda et al. (1991) , who explained 
that mixing affects the apparent viscosity of the solution, which in turn influences the 
reaction rate. The substrate composition will also play a role in this effect, because 
higher contents of amylopectin, that exhibits strong pseudoplast ic behaviour (Miranda 
et al. 1991 ), will increase the shear -thickening behav iour of the starch suspensions.

136  A lower rate of hydrolysis after several hours of reaction signifies that eith er the 
reaction is approaching its final stages (most substrate has been converted into 
products) or that the enzyme was affected during the reaction through inactivation or 
inhibition. Adding a second dosage of enzyme after several hours of hydrolysis whe n the 
reaction rate becomes steady, demonstrates whether available substrate is still present 
in the reaction mixture and whether the first enzyme dosage underwent inactivation.  
 
Figure 6.7 The changes in the concentration of glucose during hydrolysis of 70 w/w% commercial 
maltodextrins (A) or 50 w/w% liquefied starch (B) by glucoamylase from A. niger . A second dosage of 
enzyme, indicated by the arrow, has been added after several hours of hydrolysis.  
After saccharification of commercial maltodextrins for 80 hours the reaction 
reaches 40% conversion (Figure 6.7 A). At that stage the majority of the substrate is still 
available for the enzyme. Activity measurements show that the glucoamylase retains 
more than 50% of its activity even after 48 hours of re action (not shown). The addition 
of glucoamylase to the maltodextrin barely increases the glucose concentration, 
demonstrating that the high concentration of reaction products inhibits the enzyme and 
prevents further hydrolysis or that the equilibrium of t he reaction is reached.  
When the saccharification of liquefied starch (Figure 6.7 B) passes the 18 hours 
of reaction time, the reaction rate is also strongly reduced, and the concentration of 
glucose increases only slowly. A fresh dosage of enzyme at 25 h ours leads to a surge in 
the reaction and boosts the production of glucose. The conversion degree increases from 
46% at 25 hours to nearly 60% at 42 hours. Despite the initial rapid increase of the 
reaction rate, after 42 hours the curve of glucose concent ration converges to a plateau 
again. Even if the hydrolysis takes place at optimal conditions, after prolonged 00.511.52

General discussion  
137  incubation the inactivation of the enzyme is inevitable. If fresh enzyme is supplied at a 
stage with sufficiently high conversion, the high conce ntration of reducing sugars will 
influence the enzymatic activity resulting in promoting reversed reactions or inhibition 
by reaction products.  
Both enzymes used during hydrolysis (BLA and A. niger  glucoamylase) cleave the 
branch points with more difficult y than the α -1,4-bonds. This means that as the 
hydrolysis reaction proceeds, the proportion of α -1,6-glycosidic bonds to α -1,4-
glycosidic bonds will increase. This accumulation of branches will also affect the 
reaction rate.  
 
Figure 6.8 The changes in glu cose concentration during hydrolysis of (A) commercial maltodextrins (30 –
70 w/w%) (B) wheat starch liquefacts (30 –60 w/w%) by glucoamylase from A. niger, the same data as in 
chapter 5.  
Apart from hydrolysing wheat starch, we also saccharified commercial 
maltodextrins at elevated dry matter contents (30 –70 w/w%). The conditions of both 
reactions were as described in chapter 5. The production of glucose in time during the 
hydrolysis of both substrates is shown in Figure 6.8. At 30 w/w% of substrate, the 
hydr olysis reaches a high degree of conversion (88% for commercial maltodextrins and 
around 75% for wheat starch liquefacts), meaning that most of the substrate has been 
converted to glucose. As we increase the substrate concentration to 40 w/w%, also the 
conc entration of glucose increases. The conversion degree is still high, reaching just 
above 76% for both substrates. The reaction rate in the beginning of the reaction at both 
concentrations is similar, and the higher concentration of substrate decides that m ore 
glucose produced at 40 w/w%.  

Chapter 6  
138  At 50 w/w% of dry matter the reaction rate in the first hours is slower compared 
to the reaction at 40 w/w% (Figure 6.8). Even so, during the hydrolysis of 
maltodextrins, the final glucose concentration at 50 w/w% exceeds t he glucose content 
at 40 w/w% (degree of conversion of 65%; Figure 6.8 A). In contrast, in the wheat starch 
samples at 50 w/w% the low reaction rate in the beginning of the reaction also leads to 
a lower production of glucose in the end (47% of conversion) .  
From 50 to 70 w/w%, increasing the concentration of substrate decreases the 
reaction rate both in the hydrolysis of commercial maltodextrins and in the hydrolysis of 
wheat starch liquefacts. In the maltodextrins samples (Figure 6.8 A) this lower initial  
rate leads to a decline in the production of glucose within the given time and enzyme 
dosage. The final concentration of glucose at 60 w/w% reaches around the same values 
as at 30 w/w% for both substrates (Figure 6.8 A and B), but this means that only 43%  of 
substrate is converted to glucose. For wheat starch liquefacts this also shows that more 
glucose is produced at 60 w/w% than at 50 w/w% and a similar degree of conversion is 
reached despite the difference in substrate concentration.  
At low starch cont ents (10 -30 w/w%), the amount of generated glucose increases 
proportionally when the substrate concentration is increased (Cepeda et al. 2001 ). This 
is still true for the increase of substrate concentration from 30 to 40 w/w% (Figure 6.8). 
However, as the concentration of substrate increases further, the increase in  the amount 
of produced  glucose is no longer proportional to the increase in  the substrate 
concentration.  
At 50 w/w%, both during hydrolysis of commercial maltodextrins, and during 
hydrolysis of starch liquefacts, a change in the system occurs that affect s the activity of 
the enzyme and influences the reaction rate. We propose that the difference between the 
reactions using the two substrates at 50 w/w% is caused by impaired mixing of the 
liquefacts compared to the mixing of commercial maltodextrins. Miranda et al. (1991)  
suggest that an increased substrate concentr ation might not necessarily lead to 
substrate inhibition as such, but rather impose mass transfer limitations or a change in 
thermodynamic activity. The increasing apparent viscosity of the solutions, as an 
additional obstacle for the enzyme, will influenc e the reaction rate at low moisture 
contents. Finally, also increased product condensation at higher substrate 
concentrations (van der Veen et al. 2005 ) will add to the lower production of glucose.  
General discussion  
139  Designing a process of starch hydrolysis at high dry matter contents is a 
challenge, as more than just the right dosage of enzy me needs to be considered. Starting 
from choosing the right method and equipment for gelatinization, which  will allow both 
for complete gelatinization and the transport of a highly viscous and adhesive starch 
slurry, all the way to choosing the right react ors for hydrolysis. We demonstrated that 
mixing has an impact on the reaction already on a small scale. Choosing the right mixing 
speed and stirrers will become even more crucial at increased reaction volumes.  
Adding the α -amylase before gelatinization is  not advised, as the enzyme will 
undergo inactivation by the application of shear, and therefore adding the enzyme in the 
final stage of gelatinization would be more optimal. The advantages would be complete 
gelatinization, which might not be achieved if t he enzyme is added from the beginning, 
better mixing of the enzyme and substrate and finally easier transport of the mixture 
after partial liquefaction.  
During the saccharification at high substrate concentrations, adding the enzyme 
in steps might be more  beneficial for reaching the high degree of conversion, than 
adding the whole enzyme dosage at the start. This will not however prevent the 
occurrence of reversed reactions. Perhaps the already existing methods that deal with 
the reversed reactions, includ ing removing the reaction products, will be sufficient also 
at the increased substrate concentrations.  
6.5. Potential of stochastic modelling for other types of enzymes  
We demonstrated in this thesis the possibilities of stochastic modelling for wheat 
starch hydrolysed by an α -amylase and a glucoamylase. Our aim was attained, as we 
designed models capable of following all of the products of the complete starch 
hydrolysis reaction, even at changing reaction conditions. We showed that mechanistic 
modelling also has potential for practical considerations, as it takes into account the 
properties of the system, the structure of the substrates and enzymes, and allows to 
explore the nuances of enzymatic hydrolysis.  
We have come across subsite maps available for other hydrolases including α -
glucosidase (Kita et al. 1991 ), β-glucosidase ( Yazaki et al. (1997) ; Tahara et al. (1998) ), 
xylanase ( Biely et al. (1983) ; Meagher et al. (1988) ; Pollet et al. (2010) ), galactanase 
(Bonni n et al. 1997 ) and polygalactouronase (Kluskens et al. 2005 ). With parameters, i.e. 
Chapter 6  
140  subsite maps, already available in literature for different hydrolases, mechanistic models 
based on different enzyme -substrate couples can be designed without great effort. Such 
stochastic models were already developed for hydrolysis of cellulose ( Levine et al. 
(2010) ; Kumar and Murthy (2013) ), and even hydrolysis by proteases (Wierenga et al. 
2014 ).  
Mechanistic models help to extend our unde rstanding of complex systems, for 
which the typical Michaelis -Menten kinetics are too simple. A mechanistic model 
accounts for more than only the substrate or enzyme concentration – it takes into 
account the structure of the substrate and the enzyme, which  renders it more accurate, 
and better suitable for extrapolation to new conditions. Mechanistic models allow for 
the prediction of more than just the concentration of one product or substrate and are 
less limited to specific conditions of the reaction.  
As the intensification of processes is a trend in the industry, reactions at high 
substrate concentrations will become inevitable. When stepping outside of the simple 
reaction kinetics or even representing simultaneous action of multiple enzymes, models 
will also need to account for more complexity, and this is where mechanistic models 
surpass the simple kinetic models.  
6.6. Practical use of the model and the experimental findings  
The starch hydrolysis models we developed can have several potential 
applicati ons. As we mentioned in chapter 1, different mixtures of carbohydrates can 
have the same dextrose equivalent, which implies that the DE, representing just the 
overall degree of conversion, is insufficient to fully characterize hydrolysed starch. 
However, u sing only the DE values in combination with the subsite map of a particular 
enzyme, the full product profiles can be predicted for particular reaction conditions 
using our model. In this way, our model can be used to demonstrate the action patterns 
of enzy mes without even conducting detailed experiments.  
The models can also be used in experimental design, to tailor the hydrolysis 
products to specific needs. Using our model can help choosing the right enzyme, 
depending on the required characteristics of the  final products, or perhaps even in 
engineering enzymes by directed mutagenesis. The simulations can also provide the 
information on when the reaction should be terminated, e.g., when presence of 
General discussion  
141  particular oligosaccharides in the mixture is or is not requ ired. The model allows to 
extrapolate the data, therefore if we are able to do experiments only at initial stages of 
reaction, the model can be used to demonstrate how the products will develop in the 
following stages of the reaction, as the DE increases.  
The combination of the liquefaction and the saccharification model can be used to 
demonstrate the effects of the extent of liquefaction on the product profiles during 
saccharification. This way, the outcomes one would want to achieve during 
saccharificati on can be predicted without conducting any experiments. Using the model 
to indicate when the liquefaction should to be terminated for the required result during 
the saccharification to be achieved, can then significantly reduce the number of analyses.  
Ano ther application of the model could be testing whether different parameters 
chosen for the liquefaction affect the product combinations during saccharification. For 
example, replacing the subsite map of BLA with a subsite map of another enzyme can be 
used to determine which of the enzymes better fulfils the requirements of a particular 
process. The model results can even indicate, whether it is necessary to use a 
debranching enzyme, based on the quantities of branched molecules left after model 
hydrolysis. The choice of the suitable enzyme combination can therefore be made even 
before actually purchasing the enzymes.  
Finally, the models are another way of characterizing hydrolytic enzymes. On top 
of providing the optimal temperature and pH, at which the rea ction should take place, 
the information on the expected product composition from a particular substrate can be 
added. Since the type of the models we use are not limited to one enzyme -substrate 
combination, the potential for characterizing other hydrolase s becomes endless.  
The conceptual process design for gelatinization of starch in the shearing device 
and subsequent liquefaction in a batch reactor that we adapted from van der Veen et al. 
(2006)  was used in our experiments at high substrate concentrations. We confirmed 
what the authors expected: proper starch gelatinization wi thout adding enzyme can be 
achieved with a thermo -mechanical treatment in the shear cell. When the two processes 
(i.e. gelatinization and liquefaction) were separated, as also demonstrated for extruders 
(Grafel man and Meagher (1995) ; Baks et al. (2008) ), the gelatinization was extensive 
and facilitated the liquefaction at low moisture contents. As we could also successfully 
follow the liquefaction reaction with the hydrolysis by glucoamylase, we support the 
Chapter 6  
142  conclusions of van der Veen et al. (2006)  about the validity of the design for hydrolysis 
at high dry matter contents.  
The use of this process design in practice would require the addition of new type 
of equipment, as drastic change s in a process ( i.e. doubling the substrate c oncentration) 
generally require  more adaptations. However, we believe that sustainability of the 
process, after largely reduced water and energy consumption, along with the higher 
productivity that can be achieved at high subst rate contents could compensate for the 
costs of the investment in the new equipment.

Summary  
Summary  
146  Starch, used for energy storage in many plants, is one of the most abundant 
polysaccharides. It is isolated from wheat, potatoes, corn and rice, and modified to yield 
ingredients for many industrial processes. Apart from the use in the food industry, 
starc h and its derivatives are used in paper industry, in the production of adhesives and 
even in the textile industry.  
The most common modification of starch is its enzymatic hydrolysis into 
maltodextrins or glucose. The products of these enzymatic conversion s are used in the 
production of confectionery, beverages, bakery products or are fermented to yield new 
types of products. Two enzymes are commonly used for the hydrolysis of starch on 
industrial scale: α -amylase from Bacillus licheniformis  (BLA) and gluco amylase from 
Aspergillus  niger .  
The aim of the work described in this thesis was to gain insight into the 
enzymatic hydrolysis of starch and the mechanism of the relevant enzymes used in the 
process. The aim was approached by designing models that allow t he prediction of all of 
the hydrolysis products based on the quantification of the interaction between substrate 
and the subsites of the active centres of the enzymes.  
Chapter 2  describes a re -evaluation and extension of an existing model of starch 
hydrol ysis by α -amylases towards predicting all products of starch hydrolysis. The 
hydrolysis of amylopectin cannot be entirely random, because not all of the bonds are 
equally accessible for the enzyme. This was incorporated into the model. Comparing the 
model with collected experimental data on starch hydrolysis, showed that the prediction 
of the precise composition during the reaction was not yet satisfactory. The parameters 
of the model taken from literature did not allow for more satisfying predictions, and 
therefore new parameters were required.  
In chapter 3 , the subsite map, which reflects the action pattern of the enzyme, 
was shown to influence the production of the oligosaccharides in the model. The larger, 
polymeric molecules were less affected by the va lues assigned to the subsite map, but 
more by the inhibition in the model. This inhibition is based on the inability of the 
enzyme to hydrolyse the branch points of amylopectin and the bonds adjacent to the 
branch points. The predictions of the model impro ved substantially after creating a new 
subsite map and finding new branch factors (inhibition): all hydrolysis products present 
Summary  
147  in the mixture of hydrolysed wheat starch could be predicted adequately as a function of 
time.  
With the potential of the model demonstrated using one set of experimental 
conditions, the predictive potential of the model towards a higher temperature could be 
explored. Chapter 4  discusses the differences and the similarities in the product 
composition  of the experimental data from starch hydrolysis at two temperatures, 50°C 
and 80°C. The differences between the two sets of data were insubstantial, which 
indicated that the parameters used for the higher temperature should be similar to 
those for the low er temperature. Indeed, the final subsite map and the inhibition 
parameter were rather similar for the two temperatures.  
In chapters 3  and 4 it was also demonstrated that not all of the subsites in the 
subsite map are equally important in making predictio ns. The binding energy values 
assigned to the outer subsites, rather than the inner ones, affect the carbohydrate 
composition during hydrolysis.  
In chapter 5  the complete wheat starch hydrolysis by α -amylase from Bacillus 
licheniformis  and glucoamylase fr om Aspergillus  niger  was explored at elevated dry 
matter contents. Increasing the concentration of the substrates required a change in the 
methods used for gelatinization of starch and an addition of  a shearing -heating step. The 
experimental data from the liquefaction step were again used in the model  as described 
in the previous chapters. The liquefaction  products found by the model were 
subsequently  used as substrates in the saccharification of maltodextrins by 
glucoamylase. The core of chapter 5 was a new model for the saccharification of 
liquefied starch into glucose. Based on the prediction s of the model, subsite maps  were 
found that described the formation of all the products during the saccharification 
process.  
Finally in chapter 6 , the potential o f the derived model was discussed. The 
modelling approach along with  the parameters that were found, were shown to describe 
independently collected data as well. The model could also be extended towards other 
enzymes. The discussion was concluded with exam ples on where and how the modelling 
approach could be applied.

Samenvatting  
Samenvatting  
150  In planten dient zetmeel als energieopslag. Zetmeel is een van de meest 
voorkomende polysacchariden. Zetmeel wordt geisoleerd uit graan, aardappelen, mais 
en rijst, en wordt gemodificeerd voor de toepassing in verscheidene industriële 
processen. Naast de t oepassing in levensmiddelen, worden zetmeel en hiervan afgeleide 
producten gebruikt in de papierindustrie, bijvoorbeeld bij de productie van lijm, en zelfs 
in de textielindustrie.  
De meest voorkomende modificatie van zetmeel is de enzymatische hydrolyse. 
Hierbij worden maltodextrines of glucose gevormd. Deze eindproducten worden 
gebruikt in de productie van snoepgoed, frisdrank en bakkerijproducten. Soms worden 
ze gefermenteerd, wat leidt tot nieuwe productsoorten. Voor de enzymatische hydrolyse 
van zetmee l op grote schaal worden voornamelijk α -amylase van Bacillus licheniformis  
(BLA) en glucoamylase van Aspergillus  niger  gebruikt.  
Het doel van het onderzoek wat beschreven is in dit proefschrift was inzicht te 
verkrijgen in de enzymatische hydrolyse van ze tmeel en het mechanisme van de 
enzymen die gebruikt worden in dit proces. Dit doel werd bereikt door een model te 
ontwerpen wat de concentratie van alle hydrolyse producten kan voorspellen. Dit model 
is gebaseerd op de interactie tussen substraten en de su bsites in het actieve centrum van 
het enzym.  
In hoofdstuk 2 wordt  een bestaand model voor de enzymatische 
zetmeelhydrolyse opnieuw bestudeerd en verder uitgebreid. Met deze uitbreiding 
kunnen alle producten van de zetmeelhydrolyse voorspeld worden. De hydr olyse van 
amylopectine is niet willekeurig, maar volgt juist een bepaald patroon. Dit wordt 
veroorzaakt door de mate waarin een binding beschikbaar is voor het enzym. Dit is dan 
ook geïmplementeerd in het model. De vergelijking van het model met de experim entele 
data van de zetmeelhydrolyse laat zien dat de voorspellingen van de productcompositie 
nog niet helemaal bevredigend zijn. De parameters van het model, die uit de literatuur 
naar voren kwamen, zijn niet accuraat genoeg om goede voorspellingen te make n. Er 
zijn nieuwe parameters nodig om de vorming van hydrolyseproducten te voorspellen.  
Hoofdstuk 3, laat zien dat de ‘subsite map’ – die de werking van het enzym 
weergeeft, invloed heeft op de productie van de oligosachariden in het model. De 
waarden van  de subsite map hebben weinig invloed op de grote moleculen. Deze zijn 
met name afhankelijk van de inhibitiefactoren in het model. Deze inhibitie wordt 
Samenvatting  
151  veroorzaakt door het onvermogen van -amylase om de 1 -6 bindingen van 
amylopectine te hydrolyseren. Ook de bindingen die dichtbij zo’n vertakking liggen 
kunnen niet goed afgebroken worden door -amylase. De voorspellingen van het model 
verbeterde aanzienlijk na de ontwikkeling van een nieuwe subsite map en nieuwe 
inhibitie factoren. De concentratie van alle hydrolyse producten in het reactiemengsel 
konden nu op elk tijdstip bepaald worden.  
In hoofdstuk 4  wordt onderzocht of het model ook gebruikt kan worden om 
voorspellingen te doen bij een hogere temperatuur. De verschillen en de gelijkenissen in 
de products amenstelling van de experimentele data van de zetmeelhydrolyse op twee 
temperaturen (50 en 80°C) is onderzocht. De verschillen tussen de twee temperaturen 
waren niet substantieel. Dit suggereert dat de parameters die zijn gebruikt voor de 
hogere en de lage re temperatuur wellicht ook niet zo veel zullen verschillen. Het blijkt 
inderdaad, dat de uiteindelijke subsite map en de inhibitie factoren vrijwel gelijk 
worden bij beiden temperaturen.  
In hoofdstuk 3 en 4  wordt aangetoond dat niet alle subsites van de subsite map 
even belangrijk zijn om voorspellingen te doen. De waarden voor de bindingsenergie 
van de buitenste subsites hebben meer invloed op de koolhydraatsamenstelling dan de 
waarden van de binnenste subsites.  
In hoofdstuk 5  is de gehele tarwezetmeelh ydrolyse door zowel α -amylase van 
Bacillus licheniformis  als glucoamylase van Aspergillus niger  onderzocht bij hoge droge 
stofgehalten. De toename in de substraatconcentratie vereist een verandering in de 
procescondities voor zetmeel gelatinisering. Het is  noodzakelijk een hogere temperatuur 
en extra afschuifkrachten te gebruiken. De experimentele data van de reactie met -
amylase zijn vergeleken met de voorspellingen die met het model gemaakt konden 
worden. De uitkomsten hiervan zijn vervolgens als input g ebruikt in een nieuw model 
voor de versuikering door de glucoamylase. De kern van dit hoofdstuk is het nieuwe 
model dat de versuikering tot glucose beschrijft. Gebaseerd op de voorspelling van het 
model, is de subsite map van glucoamylase verbeterd.  
Tensl otte wordt in hoofdstuk 6  de potentie van de verschillende modellen 
besproken. De modelmatige aanpak zoals beschreven in deze thesis, inclusief de 
optimalisatie van de modelparameters is goed bruikbaar om onafhankelijk verkregen 
datasets te beschrijven. Di t soort modellen kunnen ook toegepast worden op andere 
Samenvatting  
152  enzymen. De discussie wordt afgesloten met voorbeelden van waar en hoe de 
modelaanpak toegepast wordt.

154  As much as we like to take credit for our own accomplishments, no  one would be 
able to obtain a PhD degree if it was  not for the efforts and caring of those who helped us 
along the way. Not often one gets the chance to say thank you in writing to people who 
gave the nudge in the right direction at a certain step of the journey towards the degree 
of the Doctor of Philosophy . There are no wrong or right ways to say thank you, 
therefore I choose to do it in ‘the order of appearance’, as many of those who I had the 
pleasure to cross paths with are equally important.  
I would not be able to get to this moment without my parents w ho always let me 
be who I am and allowed me to make my own choices. Thank you for taking care of me 
for all these years and inspiring to work hard and to never settle for anything less than 
what makes me happy. This thank you also extends to my brothers (f or ‘having a laugh’), 
and my grandparents for always having me, my appetite and my best interest on their 
minds.  
I doubt that this thesis ever reaches to any of my teachers, but I could not skip 
them in this list, because many of them said the right thing at the right time. Thanks to 
them I got on the path that led me to not only  to science, but  to the Netherlands, and 
eventually a lso to  this journey towards  receiving a PhD  degree .  
One person was there daily, through all my ups and downs – Jorik . Over the 
course of the past five and a half years we helped each other through tough times. Your 
humour and laid back approach were the cure for my neurotic, stressful moments. 
Thank you for being my best friend, for your support, for cheering on and for  celebrating 
each milestone with me. Also for doing your best to understand what this booklet is 
actually about.  
We go through life alone, but not without a support system. My support system in 
the Netherlands consisted of my Dutch family van de Laar & Har ders. Thank you for the 
interest in my work, words of encouragement and for restoring my confidence when it 
needed to be restored. Two special girls, Thalia and Maya, have to be mentioned by 
name, as without their hugs, kisses and smiles my world would be dull. The second part 
of the support system were all the people I got to meet and befriend. Thanks for the 
dinners, parties, cinema trips, city trips, football tournaments, game nights, birthdays, 
barbecues and conversations that gave the research into wha t is important in life a high 
impact factor.  
 
155  The actual research described in this booklet would not be possible without the 
support of my supervisors and colleagues in the Food Process Engineering group. Anja, 
Remko and Tiny, thank you for the encouragem ent and your hard work on helping me 
make this thesis and its chapters something I can proudly stand behind. Thank you for 
believing in me and giving me the space to grow and develop. Big thanks to Maurice, as 
without your support and willingness to answer  the billion questions I have had over 
the years, I would not be able to befriend the HPLC. Thanks for always finding the time 
to come by and ask ‘what’s up’ and for cracking jokes together. I also owe a thank you to 
Tim Baks, for being the one to launch m e into the topic and share his expertise when I 
was still in the ‘PhD -infant -phase’. I was lucky to have great office -mates, starting with 
Kashif, Nanik and Jimmy, then Ivon and even for a short time Olesya and Marta. I am 
forever grateful to Jimmy, for te aching me more on Matlab than any course ever would 
and for being there to help me solve some of the strangest modelling problems I 
encountered. I am happy to have shared my office with all of my colleagues as we always 
had a good time together, but Ivon, you were more than just an officemate. I will miss 
our daily updates and sharing all the big and small things in each other’s lives. Friends 
are there to laugh together and to complain together, and Kasia also proved to be one of 
those friends. Thank you f or our polish gossip teas, for venting through the bad and 
laughing through the good. I would like to thank all the staff, especially both the 
secretaries Joyce and Marian and all of the technicians for help with the little and the big 
things over the year s. Also a big thanks to all of the other PhD’s, who I will not mention 
by name that way definitely no one will be forgotten. Thank you for all the chats and 
laughs we had during the extra coffee breaks (as I never was on time for the scheduled 
one’s), PhD trips and other FPE -related activities. Finally, I would like to thank my 
students, Ning, Armen, Anke, Jingjing and Yijing for the help with moving my project 
ahead and for being the extra pairs of eyes, that helped putting things in perspective.  
I was luc ky to meet great people who were part of the Lean Green Food team. I 
would like to thank all the supervisors for their comments, interest and for sharing their 
expertise with us all over Europe. Vesna deserves a special thank you, not only for 
arranging so  many of the enjoyable activities we were able to participate in, but also for 
all of the very interesting conversations we had over the years. Big thanks to all of my 
LGF -colleagues: Mahsa, Gosia, Silvia, Claire, Alexandra, Nicole, Justyna, Lucyna, Tao, 
 
156  Nicolas, Klaus and Andreas for all the fun we had during the courses, conferences, 
meetings and of course in the evenings after.  
A big thank you to Jordi and his graphic design skills, for putting up with my 
wacky ideas, actually bringing one of them  to li fe and surrounding the pages of this 
booklet with a creative cover.  
This gratitude list will be concluded by thanking all those who have gone past the 
list of propositions and read this thesis, first and foremost the examining committee and 
once more all of my supervisors. Thank you for the time and effort you have put in, all 
the helpful comments and remarks and most of all for being there on the day that 
finalizes these four adventurous years.
