Review on the current status of polymer degradation: a microbial approach 

Abstract 

Inertness and the indiscriminate use of synthetic polymers leading to increased land and water pollution are of great concern. Plastic is the most useful synthetic polymer, employed in wide range of applications viz. the packag�ing industries, agriculture, household practices, etc. Unpredicted use of synthetic polymers is leading towards the accumulation of increased solid waste in the natural environment. This affects the natural system and creates vari�ous environmental hazards. Plastics are seen as an environmental threat because they are difficult to degrade. This review describes the occurrence and distribution of microbes that are involved in the degradation of both natural and synthetic polymers. Much interest is generated by the degradation of existing plastics using microorganisms. It seems that biological agents and their metabolic enzymes can be exploited as a potent tool for polymer degradation. Bacte�rial and fungal species are the most abundant biological agents found in nature and have distinct degradation abili�ties for natural and synthetic polymers. Among the huge microbial population associated with polymer degradation, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Streptomyces badius, Streptomyces setonii, Rhodococcus ruber, Coma�monas acidovorans, Clostridium thermocellum and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens are the dominant bacterial species. Similarly, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium lini, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Mucor rouxii are prevalent fungal species.

Background 
Developments in science and technology, especially over the last 2 decades, have led to the production of a num�ber of synthetic polymers worldwide. The polymers are chains of monomers linked together by chemical bonds. Polymers such as lignin, starch, chitin, etc., are present in the environment naturally. Nowadays, synthetic polymers are used in several industries, of which packaging appli�cation covers 30% of plastic use throughout the world (Shah et�al. 2008b; Dey et�al. 2012; Kumar et�al. 2011). In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries plastic played a revolutionary role in the packaging industries. There�after, approaches to transportation were changed with the introduction of carrying bags made of polyethylene (Nerland et�al. 2014). Synthetic polymers are widely used

because of their durability and low cost, but disposal of packaging material has emerged as a challenge for solid waste management, and it is a major source of pollution (Song et�al. 2009; Dey et�al. 2012). Now such types of synthetic compounds have become a nuisance affecting natural resources like water quality and soil fertility by contaminating them (Bhatnagar and Kumari 2013; Ojo 2007; Arutchelvi et�al. 2008). In the 1990s, plastic waste was found to have tripled and is continuously increas�ing in the marine environment (Moore 2008). The level of debris materials increased markedly from 1990 to 1995 on Bird Island of South Georgia; similarly, the garbage amount doubled in the coastline area of the UK during 1994�1998 (Walker et�al. 1997; Barnes 2002). It was esti�mated that neuston plastic increased ten-fold between 1970 and 1980 in Japan (Moore 2008). The total demand for plastic was 107 million tons in 1993, which increased to 146 million tons in 2000. The growth rate of the plas�tic industry in Pakistan is 15% per annum (Shah et�al. 


Plastic waste is being generated rapidly world�wide. The UK, China and India contribute 1 million tons, 
4.5 million tons and 16 million tons, respectively (Kumar et�al. 2011). India generates around 10 thousand tons of plastic waste (Puri et�al. 2013). The annual production of plastic was estimated as 57 million tons in Europe in 2012. Polyethylene is one of the common forms of plas�tic compared to others (polyvinyl chloride, polypropyl�ene, etc.) (Nerland et�al. 2014). Plastic materials have become versatile, competitive and reliable substitutes for traditionally used metal, leather and wood materials in the past 5 decades because of their toughness, flexibility and physical properties (Sivan 2011; Singh and Sharma 2008). Durability and undesirable accumulation of syn�thetic polymers are major threats to the environment. Plastic waste recycling has largly unsuccessful outcomes; of the over 1 trillion plastic bags dumped per annum in the US, only 5% are recycled. Apparently, waste manage�ment (bioremediation) is one of the ways to reduce the adverse effects and can serve as a potential tool (Shah et�al. 2008b; Ojo 2007; Ali et�al. 2014). 
In-vitro degradation of synthetic polymers is a time-consuming process (Schink et�al. 1992; Bhatnagar and Kumari 2013). Production of synthetic polymers, espe�cially polyethylene (140 million tons per annum), is caus�ing problems with the waste management, and their consumption is increasing day by day at a rate of 12% per annum (Kumar et�al. 2011; Sivan 2011; Shah et�al. 2008b; Koutny et�al. 2006). 
Plastic waste in the form of litter enters running water in different ways according to nature and ultimately contaminates the marine environment (Obradors and Aguilar 1991). The proliferation rate of plastic materials is very fast, and the marine environment is affected by such wastes throughout the world. Plastic waste causes eight intricate problems in the marine environment: 
(1)
 plastic trash pollutes, (2) plastic entangles marine life, (3) ingestion of plastic items, (4) biodegradation of petroleum-based plastic polymers is time-consuming, 

(5)
 broken plastic and its pellets disturb the food web, (6) interference with sediment inhabitants, (7) marine litter destroying the primary habitat of new emerging life and 

(8)
 marine plastic litter causes major damage to vessels. In a 1970s study on 247 plankton samples in the Atlantic Ocean, 62% of the samples found plastic matter. Similarly, in the North Atlantic during the 1960s�1990s sampling of plankton showed a considerable increase of microscopic plastics in the marine environment (Moore 2008). 




Distribution of�different types of�polymers 
Polymers are made up from non-renewable as well as renewable feedstock. These polymers are well known for their diverse applications in industries, domestic appliances, transportation, construction, shelters, storage and packaging practices. Such polymers are differentiated according to their chemical nature, structural arrange�ment, physical properties and applications as shown in Table�1 (Shah et�al. 2008b; Dey et�al. 2012; Kumar et�al. 2011; Smith 2005). 
Natural polymers 
Natural polymers are found abundantly in nature in the forms of biopolymers and dry material of plants as shown in Table�2 (Leschine 1995). The constitution of the plant cell wall differs with the composition of the lignocellu�losic biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), which provides strength (Premraj and Doble 2005). Lignocellu�loses play a critical role in developing plant biomass, in which cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are the major building blocks of the natural polymer (Perez et�al. 2002). 

Synthetic polymers 
Plastics are manmade compounds that consist of a long chain of polymeric molecules and unusual bonds, with excessive molecular mass and halogen substitutions. Nowadays plastic manufacturing involves different inor�ganic and organic materials, including carbon, hydrogen, chloride, oxygen, nitrogen, coal and natural gases (Shah et�al. 2008b). The most widely used polymers contribut�ing to plastic waste are low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and polypropylene with 23, 17.3, 10.7, 12.3 and 18.5%, respectively, and the remaining 9.7% of other types of polymer (Puri et�al. 2013). The polymer produc�tion in 2012 was estimated as polyethylene 30% (LLDPE and LDPE 18%, HDPE 12%), polypropylene 19%, polyvi�nyl chloride 11%, polystyrene 7%, polyethylene tereph�thalate 7% and polyurethanes 7% worldwide (Nerland et�al. 2014). The sales distribution and amount in per�centage of synthetic polymer consumed in North Amer�ica during 1995 and 2004 are shown in Table�3 and Fig.�1, respectively (Summers 1996; Zheng and Yanful 2005). 



Standards for�polymer degradation 
Literature and information on biodegradable products are organized by the US government, with the help of the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI). BPI is an organi�zation that deals with academia, industry and government bodies that encourage recycling of polymeric materials (biodegradable). Production of the biodegradable poly�mer involves the addition of starch and plant fiber extract. BPI provides matter to the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) for assembling ASTM standards (ASTM D6400, D6866). These are the principle databases of degradation used to supervise industry. The logo for the compostable product was introduced by the USCC (US

Diversity of�polymer degradation 
Living organisms are involved in the breakdown of plas�tic material, and consequently the recycled form reverses back to the environment. Anaerobic microbial degra�dation releases greenhouse gas (methane) in landfills, which increases global warming. Aerobic conditions are essential for fungal degradation while bacterial degrada�tion proceeds in aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions (Kumar et�al. 2011; Chandra and Rustgi 1998). Plastic can be reduced in an eco-friendly manner with the help of soil bacteria and proper water availability. Decomposition of the polymer depends on its chemical composition, which supports the growth of microorganisms in the form of nutrient sources. The starch-based polymer is favorable for microbial attack, and hydrolytic enzymes act on the polymer matrix to reduce their weight. Polymer made from starch or flax fiber shows greater biodegradability as compared to other synthetic polymers. Microorgan�isms also play an important role in the degradation of petroleum-based polymers. Petroleum-based polymers such as polyolefins are degraded through photo-degrada�tion (Kumar et�al. 2011; Sen and Raut 2015). 
Emerging technology is continuously involved in improving the processing of biopolymers by using an additive (benzophenone) during their construction. Additives play a significant role in the chemical process during photo-degradation. Such amendments affect their thermal sensitivity and UV-absorbing capacities. Chemi�cally sensitive polymers have a better biodegradabil�ity rate compared to other polymers. Similarly, thermal exposure is also involved in the breakdown of a polymer into simpler forms that increase the availability of micro�organisms. Nodax is alkaline in nature and generally involves in the structural change of the polymer (Kumar et�al. 2011; Augusta et�al. 1993). 
Renewable resources are also used in the formation of biodegradable materials. Animal and plant originated compounds are susceptible to microbial degradation (Schink et�al. 1992). Development of bio-based mate�rials is beneficial for our environment�s sustainability, maintenance of greenhouse gas emissions, etc. (Song et�al. 2009). This type of material�s manufacturing prac�tice plays a significant role in the environment by reduc�ing the amount of dumped polymer waste (Leja and Lewandowicz 2010a, b). Many synthetic polymers are degraded under exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, photo-oxidative, thermo-oxidative and pho�tolytic reactions (Singh and Sharma 2008). In the natu�ral environment, hydrolytic properties of seawater, oxidative properties of the atmosphere and sunlight radiation (UVB) make the polymers fragile and eventu�ally break them into smaller pieces (Moore 2008). The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Standards Organization (ISO) pro�vided the analytical protocol for plastic degradation on the basis of alteration in chemical structure and loss of physical properties of plastic (Kumar et�al. 2011; http:// www2.congreso.gob.pe/sicr/cendocbib/con2_uibd. nsf/4EF8A31F2BF5D3480525772A0053CD80/$FILE/ Ensayo_biodegradables_pl%C3%A1sticos_by.pdf ). 

Biodegradation of�polymers 
Degradation of polymers is a process that alters the strength and color of polymeric material under con�trolled conditions. Disruption of the chain length initi�ates the primary breakdown (aging), and several external factors such as temperature and chemicals also enhance the rate of degradation. The term �aging� is used for the change in properties. It is utilized as polymer recycling, which reduces the outcome of pollution load (Kumar et�al. 2011; Bhardwaj et�al. 2012a). Anaerobic degradation is another way to dispose of plastic materials through landfilling (Schink et�al. 1992; Shah et�al. 2008b). Cur�rently, the recycling process is increasing but the recy�cling rate is very low for most plastic materials because of the use of more additives in their manufacturing (Song et�al. 1998). The recycling rate of thermosets is very low but thermoplastics can be easily recycled (Moore 2008). Plastic comprises 60�80% of litter, and its persistence and discharge to the surroundings create harmful effects on wildlife as well as agriculture and forest land. Furans and dioxins are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and are formed through the burning of polyvinylchloride (PVC). 
Plastic waste may come from post consumption and dif�ferent stages of production (Nerland et�al. 2014; Shah et�al. 2008b). 
Worldwide research for the last 3 decades has focused on the biodegradation of plastic (Shimao 2001). Biodeg�radation is compatible (microbial mineralization) com�pared to other waste management techniques (Schink et�al. 1992). Bioremediation serves as the best way to manage waste material in an eco-friendly manner. Pol�luted sites are increasing constantly because of improper waste management strategies; such waste comes from industrial areas and community activities. Biologi�cal agents, both prokaryotic (bacteria) and eukaryotic (fungi, algae and plant), are involved in the bioremedia�tion process. Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Corynebacte�rium, Arthrobacter, Micrococcus and Rhodococcus are the prominent microbial agents being used for bioremedia�tion as illustrated in Table�4 (Bhatnagar and Kumari 2013; Kathiresan 2003; Dussud and Ghiglione 2014; Shah et�al. 2008a; Kale et�al. 2015a, b; Grover et�al. 2015; Restrepo-Fl�rez et�al. 2014; Bhardwaj et�al. 2012a). 

Different steps in�the polymer biodegradation mechanism 
Microorganisms break down the compounds into a simpler form through biochemical transformation. Bio-degradation of polymer is described as any alteration of the polymer properties such as digestion by micro�bial enzymes, reduction in molecular weight, and loss of mechanical strength and surface properties, in other words, the breakdown of material into fragments via microbial digestion. Degraded particles are redistributed and probably non-toxic to the environment. In nature, microorganisms form catalytic enzymes for biodegrada�tion (Hadad et�al. 2005). This approach is proficient for environmental waste management, and microorganisms involved in this process for oxidation serve as a tangible alternative mode to maintain the healthy environment (Singh and Sharma 2008). The degradation process is accomplished by microorganisms via different enzy�matic activities and bond cleavage. This degradation occurs in sequential steps, bio-deterioration (altering the chemical and physical properties of the polymer), bio-fragmentation (polymer breakdown in a simpler form via enzymatic cleavage) and assimilation (uptake of molecules by microorganisms) and mineralization�(pro�duction of oxidized metabolites (CO2, CH4, H2O) after degradation), which are shown in Fig.�3. Mineralization of polymers takes place in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In the aerobic condition, CO2 and H2O are formed, while under anaerobic conditions, CH4, CO2 and H2O are produced (Singh and Sharma 2008). The biodegradation procedure of a few polymers is known (Shimao 2001). Most of the microbial communities are

able to utilize polyester and polyurethane at a slower rate (s�al. 1992). Starch- or cellulose-based plastics are biodegradable; they degrade easily through composting, which can reduce landfilling and solve the waste management problem. Biodegradation with the help of microorganisms is an approachable way to clean up such plastic waste. Microorganisms are able to utilize synthetic polymers, but the composition of the polymer and manufacturing process need to be defined for the biological activity on the polymer material (Sivan 2011; Song et�al. 2009; Leja and Lewandowicz 2010a, b; Kumar et�al. 2011). Biodegradability of synthetic poly�mers with chemical groups that are susceptible to micro�bial attack can be carried out with polycaprolactone, poly-�-hydroxyalkanoates and oil-based polymers (Leja and Lewandowicz 2010a, b; Song et�al. 2009). Enzymes of microbial origin are employed to control pollution and contribute to developing an eco-friendly environment. Diverse forms of microflora are known to utilize them through the mineralization process. 
Microbial metabolism and�physiological processing of�polymer degradation 
Bacteria and fungi are a widely distributed group of microorganisms that play a significant role in the process�ing of polymer compounds in the natural environment (Upreti and Srivastava 2003). These microorganisms are used to convert the insoluble biopolymer into a solu�ble biopolymer. Naturally occurring polymers consist of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins. Microbial enzymes are the ultimate source to hydrolyze only low molecu�lar weight and soluble macromolecules. These soluble compounds are exploited by microorganisms for energy production (Gallert and Winter 2005). Microbial deg�
radation of polymers leads to alteration of the physico�chemical properties of materials. The bioconversion or degradation of biomaterials is well understood by study�ing the mechanical properties, degradation kinetics and recognition of the degraded products. The bioconversion process also alters the efficiency of the host response, cel�lular growth, material function, etc. (Azevedo and Reis 2005). 
The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle serves as one of the main metabolic pathways for energy generation from most of the organic compounds. In the TCA cycle, acetyl-CoA acts as the key intermediate and is exploited in cellular activities like CO2 formation by oxidation, acetate formation, biosynthesis, etc. The major contri�bution of the TCA cycle is to generate ATP and provide energy to the cell. Two molecules of ATP are synthesized by oxidation of 2�mol of acetate, while 34�mol of ATP is synthesized by the electron transport chain (ETC) through phosphorylation. The metabolism and efficiency of energy production vary according to the microbial

growth conditions. Aerobic bacteria are able to respire carbohydrates, but one-third of the starting energy is not utilized by the cell and is lost in the form of heat; the remaining energy is conserved biochemically. During the processing of wastewater, activated sludge reactors lose much of their energy as heat. Under growth-limiting con�ditions, the ATP consumption rate is increased and less energy is available for cellular growth and metabolism (Gallert and Winter 2005). 
Bode et�al. (2000) investigated the physiological and chemical process of biodegradation of synthetic poly (cis-1,4-isoprene) polymer and found that two bacterial strains, i.e., Streptomyces coelicolor 1A and Pseudomonas citronellolis, were able to utilize degraded vulcanized natural rubber and synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene). They observed the growth of these bacteria on polymer was better as compared to Streptomyces lividans 1326, and they were exploited under controlled conditions. Three degraded products have been identified from the culture suspension of S. coelicolor 1A, and vulcanized rubber was used as substrate. These degraded products were deter�mined as (5Z,9Z)-6,10-dimethyl-penta-dec-5,9-diene�2,13-dione, (5Z)-6-methyl-undec-5-ene-2,9-dione and (6Z)-2,6-dimethyl-10-oxo-undec-6-enoic acid. They also proposed the oxidative pathway for conversion of poly(cis�1,4-isoprene) into methyl-branched diketones by follow�ing different steps, i.e., aldehyde intermediate to carboxylic acid oxidation, �-oxidation, oxidation of the conjugated bond (double bond) to �-keto acid and the decarboxyla�tion process. The authors proposed a hypothetical model for poly (cis-1, 4-isoprene) degradation as shown in Fig.�4. 
Similarly, Mooney et�al. (2006) studied the microbial degradation of styrene. Styrene is one of the identical xenobiotic compounds and serves as a potent toxic pol�lutant to the environment as well as human health. It comes from industrial practices that involve polymer and petrochemical processing. Mooney et�al. (2006) reported bacterial enzymes involved in styrene biodeg�radation. The detailed process of styrene bioconver�sion to its metabolites and degraded products is shown in Fig.�5. Pyruvate, acetaldehyde 2-phenylethanol and 2-vinylmuconate are some of the degradative metabolites obtained during styrene biodegradation. Similarly, phenyl acetyl-CoA obtained via styrene degradation enters into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle thus plays a vital role in energy production, essential for cellu�lar and metabolic events, and also produces CO2 during the oxidation process. 




Aerobic and�anaerobic biodegradation of�polymers 
Polymer biodegradation depends on the physical and chemical properties of the polymer. Molecular weight and crystallinity are key properties of polymers that affect the biodegradation efficiency of microorganisms. The enzymes responsible for polymer degradation are cat�egorized into two groups, i.e., extracellular depolymerase and intracellular depolymerase (Gu 2003). Exoenzymes are generally involved in the degradation of complex pol�ymers to simple units like monomers and dimers. These are further exploited by microorganisms as energy and carbon sources as shown in Fig.�6. 
Polymer degradation (mineralization) forms new prod�ucts during or at the end of processes, e.g., CO2, H2O or CH4. Natural polymers like cellulose, PHB and chitin are susceptible to microbial degradation and serve as biodegradable polymers (Gu 2003; Chahal et�al. 1992; Brune et�al. 2000). The degradation process depends on the availability of O2. Polymer degradation accom�plished under anaerobic conditions produces organic acids, H2O and gases (CO2 and CH4) (Gu 2003). Under aerobic conditions, the biodegradation of the polymer forms CO2 and H2O in addition to the cellular biomass of microorganisms. Similarly, under sulfidogenic conditions polymer degradation forms H2S, CO2 and H2O (Gu and Mitchell 2006; Barlaz et�al. 1989; Gu 2003; Merrettig-Bruns and Jelen 2009). The aerobic process is more effi�cient than the anaerobic process by means of energy production as less energy is produced in anaerobic pro�cesses because of the lack of O2, which serves as an elec�tron acceptor, and this is more efficient in comparison to CO2 and SO42- (Gu 2003). 


In solid waste treatments, denitrifiers are categorized as aerobic organisms and used for nitrate or nitrite exploitation. Under anoxic conditions, nitrate or nitrite serves as a terminal electron acceptor in the metabolic respiration process. Extracellular solubilized biopoly�mers (natural polymers like carbohydrates, lipids and proteins) from CO2 and H2O form during the respiration process, while in anaerobic conditions CO2, CH4, NH3, and H2S are produced from the degradation of soluble carbon compounds via methanogens or sulfate reducers.

In anaerobic conditions, if SO42- is present, then SO3 and CO2 will form. On the other hand, if SO42- is absent, then CH4 and CO2 will form under anaerobic conditions (Gallert and Winter 2005; Mohan and Srivastava 2011; Leja and Lewandowicz 2010a, b). A larger amount of CO2 is produced at the lowest pH with lignolytic fungi (Kale et�al. 2015a, b). 
Huang et�al. (2005) investigated sludge microorganisms for degradation of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. They studied the effect of molecular weight (MW) on the efficiency of aerobic as well as anaerobic biodegradation processes of poly�ethylene glycols (MW 600, 6000 and 20,000) and found that aerobic degradation is more efficient than anaerobic degradation by means of PEG degradation abilities; 80% of biodegradability was reported in 5�days under aerobic conditions with diverse molecular weight PEGs. While the PEG biodegradation under the anaerobic condi�tion showed 50% biodegradability of PEG 600 in 9�days, 40% biodegradability of PEG 6000 in 10�days and 80% biodegradability of PEG 20,000 obtained after 6�days of incubation. Huang et�al. (2005) further investigated the nutrition effect on the degradation process under anaero�bic conditions. The enriched organic media showed its positive effect on PEG 6000 biodegradation by increasing the biodegradability. Similarly, Sridevi et�al. (2012) stud�ied the metabolic pathways for phenol biodegradation and found that under aerobic conditions phenol biodeg�radation can form catechols and serves as intermediate products by ring cleavages at the ortho or meta position. In aerobic conditions, initially phenol is converted into catechol and then intermediates of the central metabo�lism by ortho or meta fission and catalyzed by catechol 1, 2 dioxygenases or catechol 2,3 dioxygenase, respectively. They found that anaerobic biodegradation of phenol is slower as compared to aerobic biodegradation. In anaero�bic biodegradation the end product is CH4 and CO2, and under aerobic biodegradation the end product is CO2. 


Microbial development as�biofilms on�polymer 
The growth of microorganisms is observed under differ�ent environmental conditions. These microorganisms are able to adapt to conditions as experience reflects changes, and they undergo a transition. In normal con�ditions, plankton is found in free swimming form, and under transition state these assemblages of microorgan�isms attach irreversibly to the surface and form biofilms. Escherichia coli O517:H7 and Myxococcus xanthus attach to the surface under nutrient-rich environments (O�Toole et�al. 2000; Sharma et�al. 2015; Simoes et�al. 2010). Micro�organisms in biofilms show novel phenotypic charac�teristics, specific mechanisms to attach to surfaces and respond to the external signals. Biofilm formation is a highly synchronized and intricate process, as shown in Fig.�7. Some microorganisms are reported to change their morphology (e.g., Bacillus subtilis, Caulobacter crescen�tus) under harsh conditions, which allows them to exist in a hostile environment (O�Toole et�al. 2000). In the ini�tial stage, microorganisms produce some proteins such as collagen, fibrin, fibronectin and laminin as a coating material, which help in cell-to-cell adhesion in biofilm (Bryers et�al. 2006; Simoes et�al. 2010). Biofilms exist as a matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) that depends on the surrounding conditions; it consists of a series of biological and physical changes during matrix formation and from the three-dimensional structure (Prakash et�al. 2003; Bryers et�al. 2006; Simoes et�al. 2010). 


Fig. 7 Diagrammatic representations of the different stages of biofilm formation 
Microbial species grow on a wide variety of surfaces, i.e., inert or living. Inert surfaces include piping systems (biofilms on noncellular materials), medical devices (bio�films composed of microorganisms with blood compo�nents) and living tissues, which have served as surfaces for the development of biofilms and consist of single or mixed populations of microorganisms. Single species of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococ�cus epidermides and enterococci) and gram-negative (E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Vibrio cholerae) bacteria were widely reported for biofilm formation. However, multiple species popula�tions of microorganisms have been reported prepon�derantly in biofilms (O�Toole et�al. 2000; Prakash et�al. 2003). Microorganisms that form biofilms show elaborate growth by increasing their antibiotic resistance through gene regulation. Microorganisms reflect unique inhab�itance in biofilms with enhanced defense mechanisms against therapeutic agents and drugs, and they relieve their survival under sessile conditions (osmotic stress, desiccation, UV radiation and pH changes) (Prakash et�al. 2003; Sharma et�al. 2015; Bogino et�al. 2013; Simoes et�al. 2010). Some dyes are used to visualize biofilm formation, i.e., safarinin and crystal violet. The term surface attach�ment defective (sad) is used for the group of mutant microorganisms unable to form biofilms (O�Toole et�al. 2000). Heterogeneity of the biofilm matrix is one of the distinctive features that maintain the nutritional require�ment of biofilms. The matrix is composed of polysac�charides, macromolecules and water, which provide heterogeneity and form enclosed exopolysaccharides in cells; these structures protect the biofilms from the external environment (O�Toole et�al. 2000; Prakash et�al. 
2003). In biofilms, microorganisms are hugely differen�tiated compared to free-swimming organisms and form multicellular (microcolony) complex structures with interstitial voids (Sivan et�al. 2006). Microorganisms are present on the upper layer of biofilms and actively divid�ing compared to microbes in proximity to the surface and also differ in metabolism. Interstitial voids (water channels) in the matrix help to separate the microbial colonies and facilitate diffusion of nutrients, water, gases, enzymes, waste, signals, etc., throughout the biofilms. The heterogeneity in a matrix is visible in both kinds of biofilms, i.e., single species populations of microbial bio-films and mixed species populations of microbial biofilms (Prakash et�al. 2003; Bogino et�al. 2013). The structural components, i.e., curli fimbriae, extracellular polymeric substances, outer membrane proteins, flagella and pili, hugely participate and are important for biofilm forma�tion. The relieve form biofilms of flagellated motile bacte�ria compared to non-motile bacteria and other structural components such as curli and mannose sensitive type I, IV pili (TfP) encoding genes also play an important role in cell-cell or cell-surface attachments. Type IV pili play a significant role in bacterial motility on the surface and are important for quorum sensing. OmpR is reported to be a functional gene that promotes biofilm formation (Prakash et�al. 2003; O�Toole et�al. 2000; Bogino et�al. 2013). 
Biofilm formation is a highly regulated event, and algC was reported as an alginate-producing gene that enhances the biofilm formation potential by fourfold and is positively regulated by the sigma factor (Kokare et�al. 2009). Similarly, some autoinducers play a significant role in biofilm formation and have intra- and inter-species communication, e.g., AI 1, AI 2 and N-acetyl homoserine lactones (Vibrio fisheri or Aliivibrio fisheri). Such cellu�lar communication accomplished in addition to quorum sensing signaling systems, i.e., the Rh1I/Rh1R system observed in P. aeruginosa and the AfeI/AfeR system in Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans (Vu et�al. 2009). 
In addition to extracellular appendages, cellular hydro�phobicity plays a key role in surface attachment and bio-film formation (Simoes et�al. 2010). Synthetic polymers are resistant to water because of their hydrophobic prop�erties and non-polar nature that prevents water absorp�tion (Khoramnejadian 2013). Usually non-polar polymers show limitations in biodegradation because of their hydrophobic surface properties, and the formation of biofilms overcomes this barrier. Microorganisms are eas�ily attached to non-polar surfaces (plastics and Teflon), which support microbial attachment compared to hydro�philic materials. Non-polar polymer shows an enhanced surface hydrophobicity. The fimbrial structure contains hydrophobic amino acid and mycolic acid of gram-pos�itive bacteria, and the fimbriae are important in estab�lishing the cell attachment to the hydrophobic surface (Prakash et�al. 2003; Sarjit et�al. 2015). The hydrophobic nature of the surface is one of the major concerns during synthetic polymer degradation and microbial attachment to the surface. 
In gram-negative bacteria O-antigen has a significant role in governing the hydrophilic properties that hinder the cell attachment to the hydrophobic surface. Inversely, O-antigen of lipopolysaccharides and extracellular poly�meric substance (EPS) promotes the cell attachment to the hydrophilic surface (Prakash et�al. 2003). Mutants for O-antigen also showed biofilm attachment on the plastic surface, e.g., Bradyrhizobium japonicum mutant (Bogino et�al. 2013). In addition to fimbriae, other structures such as the EPS serve as the primary material in the biofilm matrix; it is a hydrated structure and chemically found as colonic acid and alginate in E. coli and P. aeruginosa, respectively (Prakash et�al. 2003). Biofilm formation is important for degradation in the natural environment. Biofilm formation on the surface of synthetic polymers facilitates biodegradation (Sivan et�al. 2006). Low-den�sity polyethylene (LDPE) serves as the most widely used synthetic polymer. Still, many microorganisms (bacte�ria, fungi) are known for polymer degradation. Tribedi and Sil (2013a) reported that the degradation of LDPE is done by the Pseudomonas sp. AKS2 strain; it forms a biofilm on the surface of LDPE. Microbial adapta�tion is a key factor for bioremediation. Biofilm forma�tion depends on the adaptable nature of Pseudomonas sp. AKS2 and shows positive results for LDPE degrada�tion by means of increased hydrolytic activity up to 31%, and the cellular surface hydrophobicity increases by about 26% (Tribedi et�al. 2015). Tribedi and Sil (2013a) reported 5�� 1% LDPE degradation with Pseudomonas sp. AKS2 and enhanced LDPE biodegradation were achieved with biofilm formation. Tribedi and Sil (2013a) conducted an experiment on hydrophobicity and found that Tween 80 had negative effects on hydrophobicity. Sivan et�al. (2006) isolated the biofilm-producing bacte�rial strain Rhodococcus ruber C208 and reported a 0.86% per week biodegradation rate. Orr et�al. (2004) reported earlier that mineral oil accelerated the degradation rate up to 50% with R. ruber C208 and enhanced the biofilm potential by increasing microbial colonization on poly�ethylene surface. Similarly, Penicillium frequentans and Bacillus mycoides exhibited biofilm formation and poly�ethylene degradation. B. mycoides colonized in a myce�lial network formed by P. frequentans on a polyethylene surface. Degradation was determined by percent weight loss, CO2 evolution and gas chromatography (Sangale et�al. 2012; Arutchelvi et�al. 2008). Metabolic activities of cells in biofilms were studied with the help of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) analysis and ATP assay (Arutchelvi et�al. 2008). The development of biofilms was observed and its three-dimensional hydrated microstructure and metabo�lism examined under confocal scanning laser microscopy with fluorescent in�situ hybridization and 16-23S rRNA hybridization (Kokare et�al. 2009). Biofilm formation also played an important role in biocontrol. Gene transfer was seen within the biofilms of Streptococcus sp. as conjuga�tive transposons and confers the antibiotic (tetracycline) resistance. 



Cellulose 
The terrestrial system is known for the plentiful produc�tion of cellulose biopolymers. The occurrence of cellulose in decaying microorganisms takes place in sundry envi�ronments (soil, aquatic, compost, anaerobic digestors and also the carbon cycle) (Leschine 1995). Several microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) were reported to have cellulose-degrading activity, and such cellulose degrading microbes exist in nature with non-cellulolytic microorganisms. Biodegradation of cellulose proceeds under aerobic (form CO2 and H2O) as well as anaero�bic (form CO2, CH4 and H2O) conditions (Perez et�al. 2002; Nwachkwu et�al. 2010). Cellulose is composed of �-1,4 glycosidic linkages between d-glucose subunits. It is found in different forms such as crystalline and amorphous (cellulose chains are non-organized and less resistant to enzymatic degradation) (Perez et�al. 2002). Cellulases are the enzymes responsible for the break�down of �-1,4 glycosidic bonding of cellulose. These cel�lulases are classified as endoglucanases (EGs or endo-1, 4-b- glucanases) and cellobiohydrolases (CBHs or exo�1,4-b-glucanases) that hydrolyze internal bonding and the end of the chains, respectively. Cellobiose molecules generated from cellulose by the endoglucanases and cel�lobiohydrolases are hydrolyzed by �-glucosidases and releases two units of glucose. CBHs act on crystalline cel�lulose effectively. Breakdown of cellulose makes carbon available to microorganisms. Pseudomonas, Streptomy�ces and Cellulomonas are reported for cellulase activity (Perez et�al. 2002; Leschine 1995; Souza 2013; Kamesh�war and Qin 2016). Fungal degradation of cellulose was reported with members of Basidiomycetes and Chytridi�omycetes (Souza 2013). Fungi are also reported to have cellulase activity, including Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trichoderma reesei. Anaerobic biodegradation of cellulose is very complex compared to aerobic degrada�tion (Leschine 1995; Souza 2013; Kameshwar and Qin 2016). Larroque et�al. (2012) studied CBM1 (carbohy�drate-binding module) containing proteins from fungi and Oomycetes (Phytophthora parasitica). In the case of Oomycetes, CBM1 is involved in plant immunity by adhesion to polysaccharide (cellulose) substrates, while CBM1 of fungi is reported for cellulose degradation. 
Anaerobic degradation contributes 5�10% of the total cellulose-degradation. In the case of anaerobic degrada�tion of gram-positive bacteria, Clostridium thermocellum was reported to have cellulolytic activity, and cellulosome is a functional hydrolytic enzyme unit. Clostridium ther�mocellum has an excellent cellulose degradation ability in cellulosomal and free-enzyme systems. Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) play an important role in their activity and form large protein complexes (primary and secondary scaffoldings) that bond with the cell wall of bacteria. Xu et�al. (2016) studied the �cell-free� cellu�losomal system and characterized two types of cellulo�somal systems by using mutants with scaffolding gene deletions. CipA (primary scaffolding) has a significant role in cellulose degradation compared to other scaf�foldings. Xu et�al. (2016) also reported that primary scaf�folding (CipA) plays a key role in C. thermocellum for cellulose degradation. 
Pretreatment of cellulose material also makes it suscep�tible to hydrolysis by reducing the barrier [chemical and physical (UV)] effects (Jonsson and Mart�n 2016; Arutch�elvi et�al. 2008). Pretreatments were employed in milling, acid, alkali and other treatments (Karimi and Taherza�deh 2016). Some cellulase genes (9, 45, GH5 family gene) were reported in insects belonging to the taxa Crustacea, Gastropoda and Annelida (Cragg et�al. 2015). Blouzard et�al. (2007) reported a hydrolytic system for cellulose degradation in Clostridium cellulolyticum and found that hydrolase belongs to the GH2, GH9, GH10, GH26, GH27, and GH59 gene families and cellulases encoding the gene from the GH9 family. GH9 enzymes were purified from E. coli and characterized from one of the enzymes, Cel9�V, belonging to this family, which showed similar�ity with cellulosomal cellulase, i.e., Cel9E (Ravachol et�al. 2014). Berlemont and Martiny (2013) examined 21,985 genes in 5123 bacterial genomic sequences that encode for cellulases and found 24% potential opportunistic strains with 56% �-glucosidases activity throughout all sequences. 
Maamar et�al. (2004) studied the mutant strain C. cel�lulolyticum cip CMut1 and concluded that the cellulose (crystalline) hydrolyzing genes were located on the �cel� cluster that encodes for cellulases. Lopez-Mondejar et�al. (2016) isolated Paenibacillus O199 reported for cellulose deconstruction and studied the O199 enzyme system. The researcher suggested the exploitation of Paeniba�cillus O199 as a second-generation technology for agri�cultural waste (lignocellulosic material) management strategies and biofuel production. 
Dimarogona et�al. (2012) reported polysaccha�ride monooxygenase (PMO) (or GH61) enzymes that enhanced the degradation capacity of cellulases; external electrons are important to accelerate the PMO activity. Some hydrolytic enzymes also play a key role in cellulose degradation, e.g., lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), CBM33 (carbohydrate-binding module fam�ily 33) and cellobiose dehydrogenases (CDHs). Similarly, Zhang et�al. (2016) reported carbohydrate-binding mod�ule 1 (CBM1) for cellulose degradation; it contains cel�lulases and is found in coprophilic Podospora anserine (coprophilous fungus) and P. chrysosporium (typical rot fungus). 

Hemicellulose 
Hemicellulose is a linear and branched heteropolymer polysaccharide that consists of sugars like d-xylose, l-arabinose, d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-glu�curonic acid, d-galacturonic acid and 4-O-methyl-glu�curonic acid, which are linked to each other by �-1,4 glycosidic bonds or rarely by �-1,3-glycosidic linkage (Perez et�al. 2002; Leschine 1995; Werner et�al. 2014; Giudicianni et�al. 2013). Hemicelluloses are found in primary as well as secondary walls of the plant and con�tribute one-third of the total dry weight of wood (Perez et�al. 2002; Jeffrie 1994). In combination with cellulose, it makes up the major part of the plant; thus, it is known as cellulosics or cellulosic waste, which comes from agri�cultural practices (Petre et�al. 1999). Xylans are the most common and abundant hemicelluloses; they are found in hardwood and softwood parts of angiosperms and gymnosperms, respectively (Horn et�al. 2012; Hatakka 2005). Xylan polysaccharide consists of a �-1,4-linked xylose backbone with side groups like acetate, arabino�furanose in high amounts and 4-O-methyl-glucuronic acid in lesser amounts (Scheller and Ulvskov 2010; Jeffrie 1994; Menon et�al. 2010; Werner et�al. 2014; Carrier et�al. 2012). Higher xylan degradation was found with carbonic acid and was easier to hydrolyze enzymatically compared to cellulose (Carvalheiro et�al. 2008; Perez et�al. 2002; Horn et�al. 2012). Xylanases remove the side chain wall by attacking the backbone (Jeffrie 1994). Xylan fermenta�tion is accomplished by strains of Ruminococcus flavefa�ciens, Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium sp. (Coen and Dehority 1970). Xylanases exist in two forms: endo 1,4 �-xylanase and xylan 1,4 �-xylosidase. P. chrysosporium is a white-rot fungus known to produce hemicelluloses that degrade endo-xylanases, acetyl xylan esterases and mannosidases. Heat-stable endo-xylanases are drived from thermophilic fungi, e.g., Thermoascus aurantiacus and Talaromyces emersonii, while Butyrivibrio fibrisol�vens (ruminal bacterium) and Bacillus sterothermophilus possess �-xylosidase. Bacillus spp. produces two types of alkaline xylanases, i.e., xylanase N and xylanase A, with an active pH range of 5, 7 and 11, respectively (Perez et�al. 2002; Jeffrie 1994; Kameshwar and Qin 2016). Some helper enzymes like xylan esterases, a-1 arabinofuranosi�dases and a-4 O-methyl glucuronosidases are required for complete degradation (Perez et�al. 2002). Endo-xyla�nase works in combination with acetyl xylan esterase for efficient xylan degradation; these acetyl xylan esterases are derived from Aspergillus niger, Schizophylum com�mune, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Trichoderma reesei and Fibrobacter succinogenes. Similarly, Streptomyces spp. are also reported for a-O-methylglucuronidases produc�tion. Phytophthora also produces hydrolytic enzymes that target the hemicellulose (Jeffrie 1994; Souza 2013; Cragg et�al. 2015). Mastotermes darwiniensis gut con�tains approximately 106�107 xylan degrading bacteria (Cazemier 1969). Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are the key enzymes for hemicellulose degradation by the break�down of the glycosidic linkages and remove the phenolic, methyl and acetyl esters. Lytic polysaccharide monooxy�genases also reported this on hemicelluloses (Cragg et�al. 2015). In T. reesei, 200 genes encode for glycosyl hydro-lases and are involved in the degradation of hemicel�lulose and cellulose (Saloheimo and Pakula 2012). Sun et�al. (2012) identified 353 genes and 34 proteins (sec�retary) from Neurospora crassa, which were involved in the breakdown of hemicellulose in the plant cell wall by hydrolytic enzymes. They reported TF and XLR-1 (xylan degradation regulator 1) played a central role in hemicel�lulose biodegradation by regulating some of the hemicel�lulase-encoding genes in N. crassa and orthologs to genes found in Trichoderma and Aspergillus, i.e., XYR1 and XlnR, respectively. In addition to the five hemicellulases reported in C. thermocellum, C. fimi and Nasutitermes species, they also have genes involved in the hydrolysis of hemicellulose (French 2009; Kameshwar and Qin 2016). 
Gene prediction analysis showed 587 gene-encoded enzymes involved in hemicellulose and pectin hydrolysis and 259 ORFs reported for gene (endo-xylanases gene) expression for hemicellulose degradation (Kameshwar and Qin 2016). 

Lignin 
Lignin is a relatively water-insoluble aromatic heter�opolymer complex. It is a phenolic polymer that provides strength to the plant cell wall via increased internal bond�ing. With its distinct characteristics, it confers resistance against biological stresses (Perez et�al. 2002; Leschine 1995; Souza 2013; Petre et�al. 1999; Hatakka 2005; Wer�ner et�al. 2014). It consists of three monolignol phenyl propionic alcohols, i.e., coniferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl. These alcohols present in lignin in the form of guaia�cyl, syringyl and p-hydroxyphenyl propanol (Perez et�al. 2002; Horn et�al. 2012; Giudicianni et�al. 2013; Car�rier et�al. 2012). Softwood lignin has coniferyl alcohol or guaiacyl propanol as the principal component, while lignin of hardwoods consists of guaiacyl and syringyl propanol as the dominant constituents (Perez et�al. 2002; Horn et�al. 2012; Hatakka 2005). Lignin present in grass contains all three types of propanol units. Polymerization of lignin consists of carbon-carbon linkages, aryl ether linkages and an aryl glycerol � aryl ether structure. At the stage of cell wall maturation, lignin polymers accumulate with a carbohydrate cross-linked complex (Perez et�al. 2002; Jeffrie 1994). Degradation of lignin polymer is car�ried out by specific extracellular enzymatic systems, such as oxidoreductases (Perez et�al. 2002; Horn et�al. 2012). Alkaline-based solubilization is also effective in lignin degradation (Carvalheiro et�al. 2008). P. chrysosporium, Chrysonilia sitophila, P. radiata and Streptomyces sp. are well-recognized producers of peroxidases, which are effective against lignin degradation (Hatakka 2005; Jeffrie 1994). Instead, the well-studied P. chrysosporium, Sporo�trichum pulverulentum and P. radiata were also reported for lignin biodegradation (Hatakka 2005; Souza 2013). P. radiata, Coriolis versicolor, P. chrysosporium, brown-rot fungus (Postia placenta) and white-rot fungi (Cyathus bulleri and C. cinnabarinus) produce the extracellular protein that increases the OH groups and makes it sus�ceptible to degradation (Jeffrie 1994; Souza 2013). These hydrolytic enzymes are able to degrade �-aryl ether and methylated lignin (Jeffrie 1994). Manganese peroxidases and laccases are also known to degrade lignin in addition to lignin peroxidases. Manganese peroxidases are synthe�sized by T. versicolor, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, Phan�erochaete radiate, P. tremellosa and P. chrysosporium. Similarly, D. squalens and Rigidoporous lignosus are the known organisms that synthesized both enzymes, i.e., manganese peroxidases and laccases (Hatakka 2005; Jeffrie 1994; Souza 2013). Pyrococcus (archaeon) hav�ing GH12 endoglucanase is reported for lignocellulose degradation at elevated temperature (Cragg et�al. 2015). Basidiomycetes (white-rot fungi) and actinomycetes are known for lignin biodegradation by forming peroxidases; these hydrolytic enzymes are accountable for lignin deg�radation (Souza 2013). Junnarkar et�al. (2016) studied the lignin peroxidase (LiP) production at 39��C by using 
P. chrysosporium MTCC 787. Enterobacter lignolyticus SCF1 was reported as a novel strain for anaerobic lignin degradation, and lignin was used as the carbon source (Fisher and Fong 2014). In biotechnological studies C. subvermispora (Polyporales) is widely used for selec�tive lignin biodegradation. Agaricales species also serve as a prominent lignin biodegrader. Fernandez-Fueyo et�al. (2016) reported lignin degradation with Pleurotus ostreatus. According to Ma et�al. (2016), P. ananatis Sd-1 produces ligninolytic relevant enzymes in addition to cel�lulases and hemicellulases. Pereira et�al. (2016) studied the catabolic pathway for �-aryl ether subunits of lignin. This catabolic pathway identified in Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 NAD-dependent dehydrogenases and glutathione�dependent lyase is important for the �-ether degradation pathway by approaching the early and late hydrolytic enzymes. Lignin peroxidases (LiPs) and versatile peroxi�dases (VPs) are able to hydrolyze the non-phenolic con�figuration of lignin and laccases and affect the linkage of �-aryl ether bonds (�lvarez et�al. 2016). Kato et�al. (2015) conducted the anaerobic degradation of lignin-derived aromatics (syringate and vanillate) by methanogenic microorganisms. 

Polyethylene succinate 
Polyethylene succinate (PESu) is an aliphatic polyester polymer and is synthesized by the polycondensation of succinic acid and ethylene glycol. In the polycondensa�tion method, initially succinic acid and ethylene gly�col undergo esterification in the presence of catalyst (tetrabutoxytitanium) and then polycondensation with a heat stabilizer (polyphosphoric acid) (Chrissafis et�al. 2006; Seretoudi et�al. 2002). Such polyethylene succinate polymers are hydroxyl terminated elastomers (Shanks and Kong 2012). Wu and Qiu (2012) reported that poly�ethylene succinate is miscible with other polymers, e.g., polyvinyl phenol, polyethylene oxide and polyhydroxy�butyrate. Polyethylene succinate has a melting point of 103�106��C, glass transition at -11.5��C and cold crystal�lization at 55��C, showing similarity with non-biodegrad�able polymers like polypropylene (Chrissafis et�al. 2005; Tribedi and Sil 2013c). The crystallization nature of poly�ethylene altered the biodegradation rates of PESu (Sere�toudi et�al. 2002; Qiu et�al. 2003). 
Polyethylene succinate serves as a biodegradable poly�ester; it contains ester bonds, which are hydrolyzable in nature and susceptible to microbial attack. The Pseu�domonas sp. AKS2 strain was reported for polyethylene succinate degradation due to its enhanced cell surface hydrophobicity, which is serving as a determining fac�tor for surface attachment. Pseudomonas sp. AKS2 cell surface hydrophobicity is important to the interaction between the cell and hydrophobic surface of polyethylene succinate (Liu et�al. 2012; Qiu et�al. 2003; Tribedi and Sil 2013b). Biostimulation (in situ bioremediation) has con�structive effects on PESu degradation by establishing a new community and shows a founder effect (Tribedi and Sil 2013c). 
Thermophilic actinomycetes were used for polyethyl�ene succinate degradation, and Microbispora were able to degrade polyethylene succinate film in 6 days at 50��C (Duddu et�al. 2015; Seretoudi et�al. 2002; Hoang et�al. 2007). Tseng et�al. (2007) reported thermophilic actino�mycetes from Taiwan with 29.0% polyethylene succi�nate degradation efficiency. Tseng et�al. (2007) reported 31 isolates belonging to the genus Saccharomonospora, Streptomyces, Microbispora, Thermoactinomyces and Actinomadura for polymer degradation. Biodegrada�tion of plastic employs different ways, and thermophilic composting serves as a promising method for removal of degradable plastic from the natural environment. Cala�bia and Tokiwa (2004) isolated a thermophilic microor�ganism (Streptomyces sp.) from soil and reported poly (D-3-hydroxybutyrate) degradation at 50��C; Streptomy�ces sp. also showed a capacity for polyethylene succinate degradation. The strain Bacillus sp. TT96 also serves as a thermophilic polyethylene succinate degrader (Tokiwa et�al. 2009). 
On the other hand, Tezuka et�al. (2004) reported the mesophilic microorganisms Bacillus and Paenibacil�lus for polyethylene succinate biodegradation at a tem�perature range of 40�45��C. These bacteria were isolated from aquatic environments. Hazen et�al. (2010) also reported that oil-contaminated marine areas supported the growth of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms. Similarly, Ishii et�al. (2007) suggested some mesophilic microorganisms, Bacillus pumilus, B. subtilis and Pae�nibacillus amylolyticus, were involved in PESu degrada�tion. Seretoudi et�al. (2002) used Rhizopus delemar lipase for enzymatic degradation of polyethylene succinate and found that the crystalline structure altered the biodegra�dation rate while the molecular weight had no significant effect on degradation. Lipases are the endo enzymes that randomly break the ester bonds. Similarly, the property of microbial serine proteases was reported for polyethyl�ene succinate biodegradation (Lim et�al. 2005). 

Polyhydroxyalkanoates 
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are well-known bac�terial-originated polymers and serve as storage poly�esters. In abnormal growth conditions, bacterial cells are committed to PHA [3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV)] production. The 3-hydroxy�butyrate (PHB) used in various medical devices was found to accumulate in several bacteria, e.g., Azotobacter vinelandii and Alcaligenes eutrophus. The use of poly�hydroxybutyrate in pharmaceutical practices is due to their bio-acceptance in patients (Bonartsev et�al. 2007; Leja and Lewandowicz 2010a, b). Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a polyester and extremely crystalline (>50%) in nature. The melting point of polyhydroxybutyrate is high in contrast to polyesters (Averous and Pollet 2012). Poly�hydroxybutyrate serves as an energy storage source for microorganisms. Polyhydroxybutyrate and its copolymer (3-hydroxyvalerate, etc.) are utilized in the production of degradable plastics (Ohura et�al. 1999; Shimao 2001; Premraj and Doble 2005). Kadouri et�al. (2002) reported three genes in Azospirillum brasilense strain Sp7 that are involved in PHB synthesis, i.e., phbA, phbB and phbC genes for �-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl coenzyme A reduc�tase and PHB synthase, respectively. Biodegradation of PHA is accomplished by microbiological mineraliza�tion and generates CO2 and H2O (Bonartsev et�al. 2007; Leja and Lewandowicz 2010a, b). Bacterial-originated PHA depolymerases are known, which may help in the breakdown of polymer (polyhydroxyalkanoate). PHA depolymerases are multi-subunit enzymes, and each sub�unit has a specific property including a signal sequence, substrate-binding domain, catalytic domain and inter�connecting domain (fibronectin type III or threonine similar sequence). Instead, the interconnecting domain of PHB depolymerase contains a cadherin-like sequence found in Pseudomonas stutzeri. PHA depolymerases and PHB depolymerases also differ in substrate-binding domains; PHA depolymerases have one domain, while PHB depolymerases have two domains (for a giant sub�strate). Polymers that contain cyclic or chain (R) oli�gomers are sensitive to enzymatic (PHB depolymerases) degradation. Alcaligenes faecalis T1 utilizes the oligomer of 3-hydroxybutanoate, and their depolymerase activity was also studied (Ohura et�al. 1999; Shimao 2001; Prem�raj and Doble 2005). Degradation of PHB was also done by Ilyobacter delafieldii in the absence of oxygen (Schink et�al. 1992; Jirage et�al. 2011). During the cell lysis pro�cess, PHB granules are released outside and hydrolyzed by extracellular PHB depolymerase. PHB depolymer�ases are enzymes that initiate the intracellular degrada�tion of PHBs. In addition to other genes (phaY, phaX, phaW), phaZ is known as the first structural gene for PHB degradation and releases the D-3-hydroxybutyrate monomer, which can be further oxidized by 3-hydroxy�butyrate dehydrogenase and the final product assimilated by the TCA cycle (Sharma and Dhingra 2016). Korotkova and Lidstrom (2001) reported the depA and depB genes, which encode PHB depolymerases for PHB degradation. Volova et�al. (2010) reported an enhanced biodegrada�tion rate of polymer films under the marine environment (seawater) instead of compact pellets, and Gracilibacil�lus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Bacillus sp. were identified. Similarly, Mabrouk and Sabryb (2001) found that the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. SNG9 is involved in PHB utilization. Weng et�al. (2011) investigated the bio�degradability of PHAs (PHB, PHBV) under controlled conditions (composting) and found that the degradation rate decreases with decreasing percentages of HV (40, 20 and 3%). Oda et�al. (1995) reported a Paecilomyces lilaci�nus fungal isolate and observed the degradation of PHB by secreting PHB depolymerases and glucose/lactose. Aburas (2016) isolated 20 fungal isolates to examine their PHB degradation potential; out of 20 isolates 11 (belong�ing to Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Trichoderma and Alterneria genera) showed the PHB hydrolysis, with Aspergillus oryzae having an optimal PHB degradation potential at 30��C and pH 6.5 in 1% PHB containing mini�mal medium. Foster and Tighe (2005) introduced a new hydrolytic system for PHB degradation that served as an accelerated model (70��C and pH 10.6) and modified the degradation characteristics. 
Shah et�al. (2007) purified the 37-kDa enzyme (PHBV depolymerase) from Bacillus sp. AF3 and found a posi�tive impact on PHBV degradation. Shah et�al. (2010) con�ducted similar studies with Actinomadura sp. AF-555 for PHBV biodegradation and achieved reproducible results for degradation, determined by SEM analysis (roughness and pits on the surface) and FTIR analysis [(cleavage of �C�H bonds and O�R groups or ester (>C=O)]. 

Polyesters 
Biodegradation is carried out on polyesters, formed through ester linkage, and esterases are the enzymes responsible for the breakdown of these linkages found in microorganisms. Some synthetic polyesters and polyhy�droxyalkanoates (bacterial polyester polymer) are known for biodegradation (Shimao 2001). The rate of biodegra�dation depends on the type of polyester. Aliphatic polyes�ters susceptible to microbial degradation and ester bonds cleave easily under the aqueous condition that releases hydroxyl and carboxylic acid containing monomers. These aliphatic polyesters include microbial suscepti�ble polymers, e.g., PCL, PGA, PLGA and PLA (Sathis�kumar and Madras 2011). Medium length monomer units are rapidly mineralized as compared to smaller or longer monomers with the help of A. flavus, A. niger and Pseudomonas sp. (Chandra and Rustgi 1998; Flavel et�al. 2006). Microorganisms are capable of breaking the ure�thane or ester bonds because of the capability of micro�organisms to attack the thermoset polymer and utilize it as a carbon source as well as nitrogen source (Zheng and Yanful 2005). The reliability of the polymer degradation rate is greatly impacted by the environmental conditions. The marine environment consists of different trophic lev�els; it is observed that the polyester (PCL, PHB/V) sam�ple was ruined after 12�months incubation in the deep sea (Sekiguchi et�al. 2011). Hazen et�al. (2010) reported that the plume of hydrocarbon in sea depths stimulated the growth of .-proteobacteria. .-Proteobacteria was reported as an indigenous petroleum degrading bacte�ria from the depth of the sea, and such oil contaminated places are known sources for hydrocarbon degrading genes. 
Sekiguchi et�al. (2011) reported five bacterial species from the Tenacibaculum, Alcanivorax and Pseudomonas genus for polyester (PCL) degradation. Yagi et�al. (2014) reported eubacteria and archaea are involved in anaero�bic degradation of polyesters (PCL, PLA). Mesorhizobium sp. and Xanthomonadaceae bacteria were identified as PLA degrading eubacteria, and A. thereius was involved in PCL degradation. Archaea Methanosaeta concilii and Methanobacterium petrolearium are involved in anaero�bic biodegradation of PLA and PCL, respectively. Zafar et�al. (2014) studied commercial composting for polyes�ter (polyurethane) degradation at maturation phase and found that low temperature supports the fungal growth on the surface of the polymer and also in compost. Poly�ester (polyurethane foam) also is a huge environmental problem and one of the major challenges to waste man�agement. Pseudomonas chlororaphis ATCC 55729 effec�tively degraded polyester polyurethane foam in in�vitro conditions (Gautam et�al. 2007). 
Nakajima-Kambe et�al. (1999) reported using strain Comamonas acidovorans TB-35 for PUR esterase pro�duction, which is involved in polyester-polyurethane degradation. Degradation was accomplished via hydro�phobic substrate binding and the catalytic domain of PUR esterase. Both of the domains play key roles in poly�ester-polyurethane hydrolysis. Gene pudA from C. acido�vorans TB-35 encoded the enzyme PUR esterase. 

Polylactic acid (PLA) 
Polylactic acid (PLA) is a polymer used in medicine and also biodegradable plastics. Bacillus brevis, Amycolatop�sis sp. Fusarium moniliforme, Penicillium roquefort and 
B. brevis participate in polylactic acid biodegrading (Ikada and Tsuji 2000; Tomita et�al. 1999; Shah et�al. 2008b). Pro�duction of polylactic acid through the polymerization of the monomer of lactic acid is shown in Table�5.

Lactic acid (hydroxyl carboxylic acid) is a basic com�ponent of aliphatic polyester polymer (polylactic acid). It is a bio-based bacterial fermented product. Fermenta�tion dependent l or d forms of lactic acid contribute to the formation of several forms of polylactic acid and its derivative. T16-1 strain of Actinomadura keratinilytica NBRC 104111 reported for production of PLA-degrading enzyme Amycolatopsis sp. also shows�~60% degradation of PLA film degradation within 14�days (Babul et�al. 2013; Garlotta 2002; Sukhumaporn et�al. 2012; Pranamuda et�al. 1997). Similarly, Prema and Uma (2013) reported mesophilic bacteria Bacillus amyloliliquefaciens for the degradation of polylactic acid. Iovino et�al. (2008) inves�tigated aerobic biodegradation of polylactic acid under a composting environment and checked the effect of the presence of thermoplastic starch (TPS) and short natu�ral fibers (coir). In the initial stage, TPS degrades faster than PLA, and TPS is most susceptible to degradation as compared to PLA. Particle size is also an important factor for biodegradation; fine particles (nano-particles) involve a complex mechanism as compared to micro-particles (Kunioka et�al. 2006). Pranamuda et�al. (1997) isolated Amycolatopsis and studied it for PLA degrada�tion, finding 60% degradation of PLA film within 14�days. PLA depolymerase of Amycolatopsis sp. serves as a pro�tease instead lipase and degrades casein silk fibroin and Suc-(Ala) 3-pNA. In addition to Amycolatopsis, Saccha�rotrix was also reported for PLA degradation (Tokiwa et�al. 2009). According to Hidayat and Tachibana (2012) 12, 21, 30 and 48% polylactic acid degradations in 1, 2, 3 and 6�months, respectively, were achieved with P. ostreatus. Biodegradation of lactic acid polymers and its copolymers was widely affected by the amount of lactic acid content in polymers. Different fungal species were reported for lactic acid and its copolymer degradation, e.g., Rhizopus sp., Mucor sp., Aspergillus sp. and Alter�naria sp. Eubeler et�al. (2009) found the effect of UV irradiation on enzymatic hydrolysis of polylactic acid. The researchers expected that UV irradiation caused a chain alteration by C=C bonds formation. Proteinase K seemed to cause enzymatic breakdown of polylactic acid. Copinet et�al. (2004) reported that higher temperature and relative humidity increase the hydrolytic rate and found UV irradiation (315�nm) also improves the bio-degradation of PLA. Masaki et�al. (2005) used the lipase for polylactic acid degradation; this hydrolytic enzyme was purified from strain Cryptococcus sp. S-2 and lipase showed similarity to cutinase family proteins. R. delemar lipase also boosts the PLA breakdown process (Tokiwa et�al. 2009). Chaisu et�al. (2015) examined dye containing polylactic acid films and found that enzymes from Aneu�rinibacillus migulanus show the same activity as protein�ase K for polylactic acid degradation at 30��C. Proteinase K was purified from Tritirachium album and served as a potent hydrolyzing enzyme for PLA degradation includ�ing L-PLA and DL-PLA (Tokiwa et�al. 2009). Strain Pseu�domonas tamsuii TKU015 was isolated from Taiwanese soil and reported for the production of PLA depolymer�ase; it is an important enzyme responsible for polylactic acid waste recycling. Optimum temperature and pH for PLA depolymerase activity are 60��C and 10, respectively. Liang et�al. (2016) purified the 58-kDa PLA depolymer�ase from Pseudomonas tamsuii TKU015. Sangwan and Wu (2008) exploited molecular techniques and reported genera Thermopolyspora, Thermomonospora and Paecilo�myces for PLA degradation under controlled (aerobic) composting. 

Polylcaprolactone 
Polycaprolactone (PCL) was widely used in the field of medical science as an elastic biomaterial. Polycaprolac�tone is a semicrystalline polyester prepared ring-opening polymerization or via free radical ring-opening polymeri�zation of e-caprolactone and 2-methylene-1-3-dioxepane, respectively. Degradation of polycaprolactone homopoly�mer depends on its molecular weight. The glass transition temperature and melting point are -60��C and 55�60��C, respectively (Woodruff and Hutmacher 2010; Gajanand et�al. 2014). PCL containing aliphatic ester linkages is susceptible to hydrolytic degradation but it seems that the PCL biodegradation process takes a lot of time (Gajanand et�al. 2014). Mineralization and hydrolysis of polycaprolactone were done by the enzymatic activity of fungi (Chandra and Rustgi 1998). Structural arrangement of PCL affects the enzymatic degradation potential. The growth and enzymatic hydrolysis by Penicillium funicu�losum and A. flavus were seen in an amorphous region of PCL (Tokiwa et�al. 2009). Polylcaprolactone is sensi�tive to enzymes, e.g., esterases and lipases; degradation was achieved by these enzymes (Ianuzzo et�al. 1977; Shimao 2001). Lipase derived from R. delemar showed a slow degradation rate for PCL because of having a higher molecular weight. Other lipase producing species, R. 
delemar, R. arrizus Achromobacter sp. and Candida cylin�dracea. Penicillium sp., are also reported for degradation (Tokiwa et�al. 2009). PCL depolymerases are also respon�sible for the degradation of polylcaprolactone (synthetic polymer) found in bacteria (Nishida and Tokiwa 1993; Suyama et�al. 1998). Blended PCLs have a greater degra�dation rate when employed with 5% sebacic acid (Salgado et�al. 2011; Tokiwa et�al. 2009). Fungi are widely reported for the biodegradation of PCL and hydrolysis. PCL showed susceptibility to enzymatic degradation; however, the hydrolysis of the homopolymer is a time-consuming process (Averous and Pollet 2012). Aspergillus sp. strain ST-01 investigates for PCL degradation and absolute bio-degradation of PCL accomplished at 50��C within 6�days (Tokiwa et�al. 2009). 
Fungal (pathogenic for the plant) derived cutinases are responsible for plant cuticle (polymer) degrada�tion, and phytopathogenic fungi are also known for their activity against polylcaprolactone, which may be due to the presence of cutinases and structural similar�ity between two cutin monomer units and PCL trimer. Breakdown of polymers (polylactate and polymalate) involves substrate-specific enzymatic cleavage through extracellular enzymes (Shimao 2001; Schink et�al. 1992; Murphy et�al. 1996). Benedic et�al. (1983) reported yeast Cryptococcus laurentii for the biodegradation of PCL and concluded that the presence of casamino acids enhanced the degradation. Similarly, Motiwalla et�al. (2013) reported Bacillus pumilus for the production of proteases, lipases and PCL degradation. Sekiguchi et�al. (2011) identified genus Tenacibaculum, Alcanivorax and Pseudomonas from the deep sea environment and reported in�vitro biodegradation of PCL. Clostridium botulinum and Alcaligenes faecalis were also recognized for PCL degradation (Caruso 2015; Tokiwa et�al. 2009). Oda et�al. (1995) observed 10% degradation of the PCL by P. lilacinus D218 within 10�days. P. lilacinus D218 releases PCL depolymerases in addition to PHB depoly�merases in PCL and PHB containing media. Optimum activity of PCL depolymerases was observed at 30��C and a pH range between 3.5 and 4.5 (Oda et�al. 1995). Yagi et�al. (2009) conducted anaerobic biodegradation of PCL at 55��C with sludge (diluted 0.86% and undi�luted 1.73%) and observed the 92% degradation of 10 g PCL having particle size 125�250��m. Yagi et�al. (2009) concluded the particle size was inverse to the biodegra�dation rate of PCL. 

Polyurethane 
Polyurethane (PUR) was prepared through polyaddi�tion of diisocynate. The urethane bond involves a chain linkage of large molecular weight polymers (~200 as well as 6000). These large molecular weight polymers are polyether PUR and polyester PUR susceptible to microbial degradation (Shimao 2001). Polyethylene adi�pate (PEA) also serves as a polymer that comprises ure�thane bonding, which is originally a pre-polymer of PUR (Bhardwaj et�al. 2012b). Ureases, esterases, proteases and lipases were classified for PUR hydrolysis via ester bond cleavage. Trichoderma sp. utilized the PUR as a substrate by producing ureases. Similarly, Aspergillus terreus and Chaetomium globosum were observed for the production of urethane and esterase that hydrolyzed the PUR (Bhard�waj et�al. 2012b; Howard 2012). Loredo-Trevino et�al. (2011) studied 22 fungal strains and found maximum urease activity in most of thm (95%), while the enzymatic activity of laccase, esterase and protease was observed in 36, 50 and 86% strains, respectively. Monooxygenase cleaves the ether linkages of the polymer of polyether. Acetaldehyde forms during ether linkage conversion with the help of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Fusarium solani and Candida ethanolica were identified as dominant species on the surface of polyurethanes (Schink et�al. 1992; Zafar et�al. 2013). Curvularia senegalensis showed more degrading activity as compared to others (How�ard 2002). Proteolytic enzymes, i.e., urease and papain, were found to degrade polyurethane (medical polyester) (Bhardwaj et�al. 2012b). In addition to papain, subtilisin was also reported for its involvement in polyurethanes degradation (Chandra and Rustgi 1998). The growth of 
C. acidovorans was observed on a PUR substrate and exploited as nitrogen and sole carbon; the extracellu�lar membrane bound enzymes have a key role in PUR hydrolysis (Howard 2012). C. acidovorans TB-35 led to the biodegradation of polyester PUR and diethylene gly�col and adipic acid were found as degraded products. Cell bound enzymes are responsible for PUR degradation and isolated from C. acidovorans. The gene for such enzymes encodes 548 amino acid protein and contains hydropho�bic domains for polymer surface attachment, the catalytic domain, lipase box and signal sequence. In previous stud�ies, bacterial species were less reported for PUR degra�dation in comparison to fungi, e.g., Arthrographis kalrae, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger, Emericella, Lichthemia, Fusarium solanii, Thermomyces, Corynebacterium sp., Neonectria, Plectosphaerella, Phoma, Nectria, Alternaria and P. aeruginosa, and bacteria from genera Bacillus and Comamonas also served as polyurethanes degrader (Shi�mao 2001; Chandra and Rustgi 1998; Flavel et�al. 2006; Zafar 2013; Akutsu et�al. 1998; Bhardwaj et�al. 2012b). Shah et�al. (2008a) isolated the bacteria from soil sam�ples and examined them for polyurethane degradation. Isolates were characterized and identified Bacillus sp. AF8, Pseudomonas sp. AF9, Micrococcus sp. 10, Arthro�bacter sp. AF11, and Corynebacterium sp. AF12. All the isolates exploited PUR as carbon source, and degradation was determined via esterase activity and CO2 estima�tion through the Sturm test, and further structural and chemical changes were examined by means of SEM and FT-IR analysis, respectively. Upreti and Srivastava (2003) observed the growth of A. foetidus on polyurethane and investigated the PUR biodegradation by means of reduc�tion in its tensile strength and tensile modulus. Ma and Wong (2013) studied the esterase activity of A. flavus for polyester polyurethanes degradation. Ma and Wong (2013) exploited esterase genes from A. flavus transfer to the P. pastoris for mass production of esterase; it may also speed up the PUR degradation rate as compared to 
A. flavus. Genes pueA and pueB played an extreme role in PUR degradation, as determined by conducting differ�ent gene silencing and cloning analyses with P. chlorora�phis and E. coli (Howard 2012). These genes are located along with the cluster of the ABC transporter gene and seven open reading frames. According to gene silenc�ing experiments, Howard et�al. (2007) suggested pueA played a significant role in increasing the cellular den�sity, which enhanced the PUR degradation. Enzymatic secretion of these enzymes followed the Type I secretion system that employed C-terminal hydrophobic secre�tion signals and glycine-rich RTX motifs, which played the critical role in stabilizing the Ca2+ roll structure. The exact mechanism of the ion roll structure is contentious; it may help with proper alignment of the signal and their secretion (Howard 2012). Gene pueA cloned from the 
P. chlororaphis to E. coli is encoded for the extracellular enzyme that is secreted from the cloned E. coli cell. The recombinant product of pueA showed similarity with the Group I lipases. Group I lipases and serine hydrolases are widely distributed PUR hydrolyzing enzymes that form a serine triad structure in addition to histidine and aspartate/glutamate (Howard 2012). Stern and Howard (2000) exploited the pT7-6 vector for subcloning the gene transfer that encoded a 65�kDa protein and displayed ser�ine hydrolase characteristics. Pestalotiopsis microspora is another instance of the production of serine hydro-lase with PUR exploited as the carbon source (Bhardwaj et�al. 2012b). Howard (2012) isolated soil microorganism P7, which was identified as Acinetobacter gerneri by 16S rRNA sequencing and reported for polyurethane deg�radation. Howard (2012) characterized and determined the 66-kDa enzymes involved in polyurethane hydrolysis and enhanced substrate specificity was increased with of p-nitrophenylpropanate, while ethylenediamine-tetra acetic acid and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride showed a negative effect by inhibiting the enzyme activity. Polyure�thanase (48�kDa) encoding genes were reported in E. coli for successfully cloning and expression. 

Polyvinyl alcohol 
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a typical polymer like poly�ethylene and polystyrene made up by linkage of the car�bon�carbon bond. It can be used in several tasks as it is converted into different shapes due to its thermoplastic�ity and also can be used as a biodegradable transportation system due to its water-soluble nature (Shimao 2001). The Pseudomonas strain having alcohol peroxidase activity is involved in enzymatic mineralization of polyvinyl alco�hol. Acinetiobacter and Flavobacterium bacterial strains show similar activity on polyvinyl alcohol (Chandra and Rustgi 1998). Fungi Fusarium lini is known to synthesize dehydratase, which is responsible for polyvinyl alcohol degradation and liberates carbon dioxide in addition to water. Pseudomonas O-3, Pseudomonas vesicularis PD, Sphingopyxis sp. PVA3, Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus mega�terium, Bacillus sp., Alcaligenes faecalis and Alcaligenes sp. were also identified as a polyvinyl alcohol degrader (Pajak et�al. 2010; Rong et�al. 2009; Raghul et�al. 2013). Biodegradation of polyvinyl alcohol through Pycnopo�rus cinnabarinus (white rot fungus) was higher when polyvinyl alcohol was employed with a combination of chemical pretreatments, which enhance the degradation (Larking et�al. 1999). Raghul et�al. (2013) isolated bacteria and investigated PVA-LLDPE degradation. These bacte�ria were used as a consortium (Vibrio parahemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus), polymer degradation by means of reduction of the tensile strength and surface erosion analysis determined by SEM micrographs. Husarova et�al. (2010b) employed TGGE (temperature gradient gel electrophoresis) for the analysis of bacterial popula�tions during the degradation of PVA. PVA was found as a potent pollutant in wastewater, and its clearance from wastewater is an important part of maintaining the water quality. Rong et�al. (2009) discussed bacterial isolation from activated sludge and identified Novosphingobium sp. P7. Novosphingobium sp. P7 showed PVA degradation in the presence of methionine in medium. On the other hand, Novo-sphingobium sp. P7 is capable of degrading PVA without methionine when cultured with Xanthobac�ter flavus B2. Sphingopyxis sp. PVA3 and Pseudomonas sp. A-41 form activated sludge, also seen for PVA deg�radation (Agrawal and Shahi 2015; Fukae et�al. 1994). Similarly, Marusincova et�al. (2013) reported on Steroido�bacter sp. PD for a municipal wastewater treatment plant, and their growth was also observed in denitrifying condi�tions. PVA degradation with Steroidobacter sp. PD was accomplished in both environmental conditions (aerobic and denitrifying conditions). Matsumura et�al. (1994) iso�
lated Alcaligenes faecalis KK314 for PVA breakdown deg�radation determined by means of stereoregularity. 
Tsujiyama et�al. (2011) cultivated Flammulina velutipes in liquid and quartz sand for PVA utilization. Patil and Bagde (2015) isolated and characterized the bacteria from plastic wastes as Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. degradation analysis involved the CO2 evolution test and spectrophotometric techniques. Biodegradation of PVA with Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were observed as 65 and 42% in 20�days, respectively. Larking et�al. (1999) examined the effect of chemical treatment on PVA bio-degradation and found a constructive effect of Fenton�s reagent (chemical treatment) on the PVA biodegrada�bility rate of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus (white rot fun�gus). Chen et�al. (2007) investigated the mixed culture of microorganisms from sludge samples and found their great potential to degrade PVA (low polymerization and high saponification). Intracellular and extracellular PVA hydrolyzing enzymes are capable of degrading PVA and form molecules that were detected and examined in the cellular extract. They studied two strains from the mixed culture and found their capability to degrade PVA1799; instead PVA124 and PVA124 showed resistance to degra�dation by these two strains. Hirota-Mamoto et�al. (2006) identified the gene pvaA involved in PVA degradation by encoding the PVA dehydrogenase. They used the Sphin�gomonas sp. 113P3 strain for purification of PVA dehy�drogenase (pvaA) and cloned the pvaA gene in E. coli with a hexahistidine tag that showed similar features as the pvaA gene reported from the Sphingomonas sp. 113P3 strain. PVA dehydrogenase was also reported from some other strains, e.g., Pseudomonas sp. VM15C, Xan�thomonas sp. and Azoarcus sp. EbN1. Shimao et�al. (2000) investigated the genes pvaA and pvaB of Pseudomonas sp. VM15C that encoded for PVA hydrolyzing enzyme, i.e., PVA dehydrogenase and oxidized PVA hydrolase, respectively. The protein was encoded by gene pvaB, having serine hydrolase characteristics. Oxidized PVA hydrolase degrades PVA in combination with the gene product of pvaA. PVA degradation was reported for both extracellular PVA oxidase and periplasmic PVA dehydro�genase. Periplasmic PVA dehydrogenase is widely dis�tributed in gram-negative bacteria (Kawai and Hu, 2009). Similarly, Hu et�al. (2007) reported PVA degradation by the Sphingopyxis sp. 113P3 strain and observed that PVA with lower molecular size degrades faster as compared to average molecular size PVA. Periplasmic PVA dehydro�genase was found as an active enzyme of Sphingopyxis sp. 113P3 that hydrolyzes PVA. 

Polyethylene glycols 
Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are extensively used in bio�medical applications, drug delivery, biosensor materials and fabrication applications (Datta 2007). Polyethylene glycols act as plasticizers with molecular weight of 6000. 
P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri and Sphingomonas sp. are involved in polyethylene glycol mineralization and symbiotically by Rhizobium sp. and Sphingomonas ter�rae (Smith 2005). Aerobic biodegradation of polyethyl�ene glycols in fragmented form is carried out through the extracellular enzymatic activity of P. aeruginosa strains. 
P. stutzeri JAl001 strain is recognized as a biodegrader of polyethylene glycols (M.W. 13,000�14,000). Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Bacteroides sp., Flavobacterium sp. and the consortium of Pseudomonas sp. with Flavobacterium sp. are also able to degrade polyethylene glycols (Ojo 2007; Flavel et�al. 2006). 
Sphingomonas sp., P. aeruginosa and P. stutzeri micro�organisms are reported to have high molecular weight (4000�20,000) PEG degradation. Alcohol dehydrogenase of strain Rhodopseudomonas acidophilia M402 seemed to hydrolyze PEGs. Kawai et�al. (2010) identified five genes in peg operon system genes that are responsible for PEG degradation, and they were recognized and cloned. These genes, in the presence of PEG and araC, act as a regulator. The PEG carboxylate dehydrogenase encod�ing gene also helped in PEG metabolism and was found in the downstream region of peg operon. Ether linkage showed susceptibility to several bacterial enzymes, e.g., ether hydrolase, peroxidase, monoxygenase, glycolate oxidase and laccase. 
Charoenpanich et�al. (2006) studied the dual regulation operon system Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida 103 for PEG degrading genes (pegB, C, D, A and E) and found regula�tor gene pegR encoding AraC-type regulator. PEGs serves as an inducer for pegA promoter and pegR promoter; it also induces the pegB promoter in additional oligomeric ethylene glycols. The pegB promoter having a regulator (AraC/XylS) binding site played the key role in the tran�scription of peg operon. Instead, AraC/XylS-type regu�lator and GalR/LacI-type regulator served to bind pegA promoter and pegR promoter, and the peg operon worked actively. Tani et�al. (2007) reported S. macrogoltabida 103, S. macrogoltabida 203 and S. terrae for PEG deg�radation. The genes peg B, C, D, A, E and R observed from these strains served as PEG hydrolyzing genes that encoded the receptor protein and enzymes, e.g., dehy�drogenase, permease and ligase. Gene pegC reported in strain S. macrogoltabidus 103 encoded the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase located upstream of pegA. Ohta et�al. (2005) discussed the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli, and a cloned enzyme showed similarity to NAD (P)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase. They reported this enzyme as a novel nicotinoprotein aldehyde dehydrogenase from S. mac�rogoltabidus 103, and, activated by Ca2+, that enzyme was involved in PEG degradation. On the other hand, Ohtsubo et�al. (2015) sequenced the complete genome of Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida (NBRC 15033); they did not find the gene pegA in peg operon is involved in PEG degradation. Sugimoto et�al. (2001) purified and charac�terized the dye-linked dehydrogenase from S. terrae and initiated the enzymatic degradation of PEG by oxidizing the terminal alcohol. They cloned the pegA gene in E. coli and purified the recombinant enzyme as a homodi�meric protein (58.8�kDa) that bound to flavin adenine dinucleotide. PEG dye-linked dehydrogenases serve as a novel type of flavoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase. Frings et�al. (1992) discussed two bacteria, i.e., Pelobacter vene�tianus and Bacteroides PG1, for anaerobic degradation of PEG. Diol dehydratase and PEG acetaldehyde lyase are hydrolyzing enzymes identified in P. venetianus; oxygen and citrate/sulfhydryl compounds showed their sensitiv�ity and optimum effect, respectively, for both enzymes. Bacteroides PG1 has PEG acetaldehyde lyase similar to P. venetianus. 

Polyethylene 
Polyethylene is the most utilized form of synthetic poly�mer and highly hydrophobic in nature (Mahalakshmi et�al. 2012). In the case of polyethylene, the biodegra�dability is inverse to its molecular weight. Less than 620 molecular weight hydrocarbon oligomers favor the growth of microorganisms; high molecular weight poly�ethylene is resistant to biodegradation. Its hydropho�bic nature hinders its bioavailability. Some physical and chemical treatments used before biodegradation increase its effectiveness. Such treatments include UV irradiation, photo-oxidation, thermal treatment and oxidation with nitric acid. Oxidation of polyethylene raises the surface hydrophilicity, which ultimately increases the biodegra�dation (Hadad et�al. 2005). Chemical treatments (0.5�M HNO3 and 0.5�M NaOH) of polyethylene accelerate the biodegradation by Pseudomonas sp. (Nwachkwu et�al. 2010). Polyethylenes and polystyrenes with ether linkage are susceptible to monooxygenases attack (Schink et�al. 1992). Biodegradation of polyethylene enhanced by the physical treatments causes pre-ageing via light or heat exposure. A hot air oven was used for abiotic oxidation and created a molecular weight distribution at 60��C fol�lowed by incubated with polymer degrading microorgan�isms. Genera Gordonia and Nocardia are associated with the biodegradation process (Bonhommea et�al. 2003). 
Some genera are also reported for polyethene degra�dation (Bacillus, Lysinibacillus, Pseudomonas, Staphy�lococcus, Streptococcus, Micrococcus, Streptomyces, Rhodococcus, Proteus, Listeria, Vibrio, Bravibacillus, Serratia, Nocardia, Diplococcus, Moraxella, Penicillium, Arthrobacter, Aspergillus, Phanerochaete, Chaetomium and Gliocladium) (Arutchelvi et�al. 2008; Grover et�al. 2015; Koutny et�al. 2006; Bhardwaj et�al. 2012b; Restrepo-Fl�rez et�al. 2014). Polyethylene is utilized as a carbon source by microorganisms, and biofilm formation on it shows their effectiveness. Biofilm formation improved with the addition of mineral oil (0.05%) to the medium. Nonionic surfactants can promote the polymer biodeg�radation by increasing the hydrophilicity of the polymer, which helps in the adhesion of microorganisms on the polymer (Hadad et�al. 2005). 
Polyethylene can be degraded by hydro- or oxo-biodeg�radation. The biodegradation method depends upon the ingredients used in the formation. Fungi (Mucor rouxii NRRL 1835, A. flavus) and strains of Streptomyces are also involved in starch-based polyethylene degradation. Degraded polymers are explained by surface fractures, bond scratching and other changes like color, etc., and such alterations examined by scanning electron micros�copy and FT-IR. Degraded polymer shows conforma�tional changes in its texture that support the wideness of the microbial population (Mahalakshmi et�al. 2012). Streptomyces badius 252 and Streptomyces setonii 75Vi2 have the ability to degrade lignocelluloses while Strep�tomyces viridosporus T7A acts on heat-treated degra�dable plastics (Pometto et�al. 1992). Abiotic factors play an important role in increasing the surface availability for microbial growth on polymers; these factors include photo-oxidation, physical disintegration and hydroly�sis that cause decreasing molecular weight (Singh and Sharma 2008). R. ruber degrades polyethylene via colo�nizing on them and forms a biofilm (Basnett et�al. 2012). Peroxidant additives are employed in polyethylene man�ufacturing for agriculturally used plastic, this type of polyethylene showing susceptibility to thermal and pho�tochemical mineralization in�vitro. In addition to UV and heat treatments, it reduces the strength of hydrox�yls and carbonyls by changing their structure (Feuilloley et�al. 2005; Li 2000). P. chrysosporium and Streptomyces sp. are known to degrade starch-blended polyethylene (Flavel et�al. 2006). Similar results were reported by Pso�miadou et�al. for starch-blended LDPE degradation by means of a reduction in mechanical properties (Psomia�dou et�al. 1997). Arvanitoyannis et�al. (1998) attempted to make biodegradable blended LDPE with starch and found that starch 10% (w/w) content in blended LDPE enhanced its biodegradation rate by altering the mechan�ical properties. 
Microorganisms take part in degradation via modifi�cation of their metabolic functional pathways according to environmental conditions to utilize xenobiotic com�pounds. A bioremediation process is more affordable by discovering novel catabolic mechanisms (Ojo 2007). The biodegradation process is slow but this does not indi�cate that ingredients in plastic material and polymers are not bioactive. Polycarbonate plastics undergo leach�ing of bioactive bisphenol-A monomer when undergo�ing salt exposure in seawater. Commercial use of several synthetic polymers made with bioactive additives mono�mers, which are non-stick compounds; softeners and UV stabilizers are found in nature. Their degradation rate depends on the environmental circumstances. Symphony is a type of polymeric material that is used in polyethyl�ene formation and degradable in nature (Moore 2008; Kumar et�al. 2011). 
Yoon et�al. (2012) isolated low molecular weight poly�ethylene degrading bacteria and identified Pseudomonas sp. E4. They found 28.6, 14.9, 10.3 and 4.9% carbon min�eralized from different molecular weight (1700, 9700, 16,900, 23,700) polyethylene samples within 80�days at 37��C that evolved CO2. The alkB gene encoded the enzyme alkane hydroxylase, and Yoon et�al. (2012) cloned the alkB from Pseudomonas sp. E4 to E. coli strain BL21 and found their carbon mineralization potential as 19.3% in 80�days at 37��C. Yoon et�al. (2012) concluded that alkB gene played a key role in polyethylene degrading. Santo et�al. (2013) reported bacterial originated copper-binding laccase from R. ruber for enzymatic degradation of poly�thene. Nowadays different groups of microorganisms are reported for biofilm formation. Similarly, Tribedi et�al. (2015) studied Pseudomonas sp. AKS2 for biofilm formation and reported LDPE degradation. They found enhanced microbial growth with 26% surface hydropho�bicity and 31% hydrolytic activity. 
Odusanya et�al. (2013) observed the surface deformities of plastic when treated with S. marcescens; further deg�radation was evaluated by the reduction in glass transi�tion temperature (Tg) and reduction in crystallinity via DSC analysis. Similarly, Ambika et�al. (2015) identified a marine bacterial strain as Achromobacter denitrificans S1 for LDPE degradation that was determined by NMR, XRD, TGA and GCMS analysis. Das and Kumar (2015) investigated a sample of municipal solid soil for distribu�tion of polymer degrading microorganisms and isolated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BSM-1 and B. amyloliquefa�ciens BSM-2. Das and Kumar (2015) found enhanced bio-degradation with strain B. amyloliquefaciens BSM-2 in comparison to B. amyloliquefaciens BSM-1. The rate and efficiency of polymer degradation were determined by pH alteration in media, CO2 evolution, weight loss, SEM and FT-IR analysis. Similarly, Gajendiran et�al. (2016) iso�lated a fungus from landfill soil, identified as A. clavatus (strain JASK1). They exploited A. clavatus for LDPE deg�radation by incubating the samples for 90�days and evalu�ated the biodegradation by means of CO2 evolution, SEM and AFM analysis. 
Restrepo-Fl�rez et�al. (2014) discussed the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on the initiation of polyethylene degradation by including enzymatic hydrolysis, photo-oxidation (UV light), etc. The number of carbons present on the polymer influenced the rate of degradation via enzyme interactions. Structural arrangements are also important in degradation; it was observed that amor�phous regions are more susceptible to microbial attack. Thomas et�al. (2015) reported three microbial species for polythene degradation, i.e., P. fluorescens, S. aureus and 
A. niger. They used P. fluorescens and evaluated the deg�radation in laboratory conditions as well as the field envi�ronment; 8.06% degradation was found within a month under laboratory conditions, and 8 and 16% degrada�tions were observed in 9 and 12�months, respectively, in field conditions. Pramila et�al. (2012) reported LDPE degrading bacterial strains isolated from the municipal landfill, i.e., Brevibacillus parabrevis PL-1, Acinetobacter baumannii PL-2, A. baumannii PL-3 and P. citronello�lis PL-4. The polymer (LDPE) degradation potentials of bacterial strains were determined by the biofilm forma�tion ability on polymers and CO2 evolution from the car�bon mineralization of polymer. Muenmee et�al. (2015) used a bacterial consortium (heterotrophs, autotrophs and methanotrophs) for HDPE and LDPE degradation and found Methylobacter sp. or Methylocella sp. (metha�notrophs) predominantly on the surface of deteriorated samples. The LDPE degradation rate was reported as lowest in comparison to HDPE degradation. 
Muenmee et�al. (2016) conducted an experiment for HDPE and LDPE degradation with type I and type II methanotrophs, heterotrophs and nitrifying bacteria. Degradation was accomplished under lysimeters in dif�ferent environmental conditions. Muenmee et�al. (2016) reported these microorganisms as prominent polymer (HDPE and LDPE) degraders, identified as Nitrosomonas sp. AL212, Nitrobacter winogradkyi, Burkholderia sp., Methylobactor sp., Methylococcus capsulatus, Methylo�cystic sp. and Methylocella sp. Duddu et�al. (2015) studied 83 microbial isolates for biosurfactant production from oil-contaminated sites. Out of 83 isolates, the NDYS-4 isolate was identified as Streptomyces coelicoflavas 15399T and selected for LDPE degradation, showing 30% weight loss in 4 months and metabolic activity of isolates evaluated by TTC reduction test. 
Soil-buried LDPE showed active microbial growth on LDPE in 7�9�months, and surface deterioration was con�firmed within 17�22�months as determined by SEM anal�ysis (Mumtaz et�al. 2010). Abrusci et�al. (2011) tested the biodegradability of photo-degraded polyethylene through Bacillus cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis and Breviba�cillus borstelensis at 30 and 45��C. These microorgan�isms were isolated from soil-buried polyethylene films and B. borstelensis obtained from a German collection of microorganisms and cell cultures. Degradation of poly�mers was observed by means of biofilm formation and other deformities, characterized and confirmed by ATR, FTIR, chemiluminescence and GC-product analysis. The maximum carbon mineralization was found at 11.5% and 7�10% with B. borstelensis and MIX (a mixed culture of Bacillus cereus, B. megaterium and B. subtilis), respec�tively, at 45��C. 
Devi et�al. (2015) reported two fungal strains for pol�yethylene (HDPE) degradation via biofilm formation. These fungal strains were identified as Aspergillus tubin�gensis VRKPT1 and A. flavus VRKPT2. Biofilm formation and surface deformation as a result of fungal degradation were determined by epifluorescent microscope and SEM. 
Hadad et�al. (2005) isolated B. borstelensis 707 from soil and exploited it for polyethylene degradation. They found maximum biodegradation with pretreated (photo�oxidation) polyethylene samples by means of reduc�tion in molecular weight and gravimetric weight, i.e., 30 and 11%, respectively. Similarly, Fontanella et�al. (2010) observed the effect of oxidants on LLDPE, LDPE and HDPE degradation. They used manganese, iron and cobalt as prooxidants in polythene; samples were placed for pretreatment by thermal method and photooxidation. They exploited Rhodococcus rhodochrous in the degrada�tion of pretreated polymer samples. Bacterial activity and biodegradation were determined by adenosine triphos�phate content and 1H NMR spectroscopy, respectively; surface alteration was confirmed by SEM analysis. 
It was found that accelerated degradation of polyeth�ylene was observed for abiotic treatments that included thermo- and photo-oxidation. These treatments oxi�dized the prooxidants and helped polyethylene deg�radation. Exploitation of prooxidants as blended in polyethylene formation make it further susceptible to microbial deterioration. 
Husarova et�al. (2010a) investigated biodegradation of calcium carbonate (prooxidant) containing LDPE. They found that prooxidant containing LDPE degraded (car�bon mineralization) 16% in 80�days, while samples that did not contain any prooxidant were mineralized 7% in 13�months under soil and 23% in compost conditions. Mehmood et�al. (2016) isolated bacterial strains from a solid waste dump and identified P. aeruginosa CA9, Bur�kholderia seminalis CB12 and Stenotrophomonas pava�nii CC18; these strains were tested for modified LDPE [blend of titania (TiO2) and starch]. Out of three strains, CC18 showed enhanced viability and degradation. The reproducibility of degradation was examined by SEM, TGA, XRD and FTIR analysis, and bacterial growth was scrutinized by biofilm formation, salt aggregation test and cell surface hydrophobicity. P. citronellolis EMBS027 isolated from landfill soil of municipal sites showed LDPE deterioration (Bhatia et�al. 2014). Sheik et�al. (2015) reported Aspergillus sp., P. lilacinus and L. theobromae as endophytic fungi for laccase production and polymer (LDPE) degradation. They incubated fungal cultures with radiation (with different range 0�1000�kGy) irradiated LDPE samples and observed the reduction in intrinsic viscosity and average molecular weight. On the other hand, Shahnawaz et�al. (2016) isolated Lysinibacillus fusi�formis VASB14/WL and Bacillus cereus strain VASB1/TS from rhizospheric soil of Avicennia marina and reported them for polythene degradation. 



Conclusion 
Microorganisms are capable of degrading inorganic and organic materials, and interest has been aroused to study microbes for their ability to degrade plastic polymers. 
P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, S. badius, S. setonii, R. ruber, C. acidovorans, C. thermocellum and B. fibrisolvens are the dominant bacterial spp. associated with polymer degra�dation. P. aeruginosa is one of the widely reported micro�organisms for polymer degradation via biofilm formation with the help of alginate-like chemicals and quorum sens�ing signaling systems, i.e., Rh1I/Rh1R. Biofilm formation improves the degradation efficiency followed by the min�eralization (polyethylene glycols mineralization) process. Pseudomonas aeruginosa CA9 is reported to have bet�ter biodegradation with LDPE, Pseudomonas sp. AKS2 is reported for biofilm formation on LDPE and biodeg�radation of LDPE via enhancing microbial growth with 26% surface hydrophobicity and 31% hydrolytic activity. 
P. stutzeri is reported for high molecular weight (4000� 20,000) PEG degradation, and Streptomyces badius 252 and Streptomyces setonii 75Vi2 were more effective against heat-treated degradable plastics. Rhodococcus ruber has been reported to colonize and degrade polyethylene by forming a biofilm and hydrolyting enzymes. Polyethylene biodegradation was improved by introducing peroxidant additives in manufacturing processes that make it suscep�tible to in�vitro thermal and photochemical mineralization. 
C. acidovorans TB-35 is also useful for polyester�polyure�thane degradation through PUR esterase production and enzymatic hydrolysis. Gene pudA is the key gene from Comamonas acidovorans TB-35 encoding the enzyme PUR esterase. Fungi like A. niger, A. flavus, F. lini, P. cin�nabarinus and M. rouxii are prevalently found for poly�mer degradation. A. niger produces acetyl xylan esterase, which works with the combination of endo-xylanase for efficient xylan degradation. A. niger and A. flavus are also suitable for the rapid mineralization of medium-length monomer units. A. niger is effective in polythene degrada�tion, while Aspergillus flavus is reported for PCL as well as polythene biodegradation. Similarly, Mucor rouxii NRRL 1835, Aspergillus flavus and Streptomyces are also involved in starch-based polyethylene degradation. Fusarium lini is involved in synthesizing dehydratase, which is respon�sible for polyvinyl alcohol degradation with CO2 and H2O formation. P. cinnabarinus is also known as white rot fungus and is involved in PVA biodegradation in the pres�ence of Fenton�s reagent. The above discussion illustrates the occurrence of polymer-degrading microorganisms. Hence, further studies on the screening of effective micro�bial strains are essential to minimize polymer risks for the environment.
