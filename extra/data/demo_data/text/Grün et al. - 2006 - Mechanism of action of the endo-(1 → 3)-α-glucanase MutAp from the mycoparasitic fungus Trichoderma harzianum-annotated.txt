Abstract (1 ﬁ3)-a-Glucanases catalyze the hydrolysis of fun-
gal cell wall (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan, and function during cell division
of yeasts containing this cell wall component or act in mycopar-
asitic processes. Here, we characterize the mechanism of action
of the (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucanase MutAp from the mycoparasitic fun-
gusTrichoderma harzianum . We observed that MutAp releases
predominantly b-glucose upon hydrolysis of crystalline (1 ﬁ3)-
a-glucan, indicating inversion of the anomeric conﬁguration.
After having identiﬁed (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan tetrasaccharide as the
minimal substrate for MutAp, we showed that reduced
(1ﬁ3)-a-glucan pentasaccharide is cleaved into a trisaccharide
and a reduced disaccharide, demonstrating that MutAp displaysendo-hydrolytic activity. We propose a model for the catalytic
mechanism of MutAp, whereby the enzyme breaks an intrachain
glycosidic linkage of (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan, and then continues its
hydrolysis towards the non-reducing end by releasing b-glucose
residues in a processive manner.

1. Introduction
(1ﬁ3)-a-Glucanases are glycoside hydrolases that catalyze
the degradation of (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan, a water-insoluble poly-
saccharide in the cell wall of many fungi. Both bacteria [1–5]
and fungi [6–16] are known to produce (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucanases,
but their respective glucanases are quite distinct in amino acidsequence. Based on amino acid sequence similarities, the fun-
gal (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucanases have been assigned a separate family
of glycoside hydrolases, GH-71. Its founding member is the(1ﬁ3)-a-glucanase MutAp from the fungus T. harzianum .
This mycoparasite has gained special interest because of its
use in the biocontrol of fungal plant pathogens [17,18] and
its secretion of a wide range of carbohydrate-active hydrolases,
such as (1 ﬁ3)-b-glucanases, (1 ﬁ6)-b-glucanases, chitinases,
and cellulases, as well as MutAp [19].
MutAp was ﬁrst described by Guggenheim and Haller as an
enzyme able to hydrolyze mutan, a mainly (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan-containing extracellular polysaccharide produced by tooth-col-
onizing streptococci [14]. Later, Fuglsang and colleagues indi-
cated that the carboxyl-terminal domain of MutAp forms apolysaccharide-binding domain, whereas the amino-terminaldomain represents the actual catalytic domain [8]. Ait-Lahsen
and colleagues characterized the hydrolytic activity of MutAp
(denoted AGN13.1 in their report) and showed that glucose isits major hydrolysis product after incubation with crystalline
(1ﬁ3)-a-glucan [20]. Furthermore, they reported that MutAp
was unable to hydrolyze periodate-oxidized (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan,
leading them to propose that this enzyme possesses an exo-
hydrolytic activity [20]. Recently, we characterized another
member of the GH-71 family, the (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucanase Agn1p
from the ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe
[21]. Agn1p
shares strong amino acid sequence similarities with the cata-
lytic domain of MutAp but lacks a separate polysaccharide-
binding domain. Furthermore, it hydrolyzes (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan
predominantly into pentasaccharides, rather than glucose res-
idues [21]. Based on these data, we concluded that Agn1p has
endo-hydrolytic, rather than exo-hydrolytic, activity.
Here, we perform an in-depth analysis into the mechanism
of action of MutAp and address the apparently-contradictory
results regarding the hydrolytic activities of MutAp andAgn1p. By using crystalline (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan as well as deﬁned
(1ﬁ3)-a-glucan oligosaccharides as substrates, we show that
MutAp exhibits an endo-hydrolytic activity. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that, after the initial intrachain attack, hydrolysisproceeds in a repetitive manner towards the non-reducing end,
releasing b-glucose residues as the major digestion product. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time a processive mechanismhas been ascribed to a GH-71 enzyme.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. MutAp isolation and a-glucan preparations
MutAp was puriﬁed as described previously [21]and its identity was
reconﬁrmed by mass spectrometric analysis [21], which detected a total
of 11 tryptic peptides that matched the MutAp amino acid sequence[8], providing a coverage of 18%. His-tagged Agn1p and a-glucan were
isolated as described [21]. To obtain water-soluble substrate, crystalline
a-glucan was partly O-(carboxy)methylated as described by Kiho et al.
[22], ensuring that the a-glucan was solubilized without aﬀecting en-
zyme activity. Carboxymethyl groups were hardly observed by nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To lower background sig-nals in the colorimetric enzyme assays (see below), the reducing endsof carboxymethylated a-glucan were reduced with excess sodium
borohydride.

To ensure a complete removal of (1 ﬁ4)-linked residues and a com-
plete oxidation of the terminal residues, crystalline a-glucan prepara-
tions were incubated with sodium periodate at 4 /C176C in the dark over
a period of two weeks as described by Gru ¨n et al. [23]. Linkage analysis
of the reaction product using gas chromatography electron-impactmass spectrometry showed complete removal of 4-substituted glucoseresidues, indicating complete oxidation (data not shown). Sodiumborohydride reduction and mild acid hydrolysis (Smith degradation)were performed as described [23].
2.2. Enzyme assays
Activity of Agn1p-his (at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.9 lg/ml) or MutAp
(0.4lg/ml) on crystalline (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan (4 mg/ml) was measured in
50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, at 37 /C176C for 30 min. Subsequently,
remaining insoluble (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan was removed by three subsequent
centrifugation steps, each for 3 min at 10000 ·g, and hydrolysis products
were analyzed using colorimetric assays with p-hydroxybenzoic acid
hydrazide (PAHBAH) [24]or glucose oxidase (GOD) [25].T h es a m ea s -
says were used to monitor the ability of MutAp (0.4 lg/ml) to hydrolyze
crystalline (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan that was oxidized, oxidized and then re-
duced, or Smith-degraded (4 mg/ml each).
Enzyme assays for high-performance anion-exchange chromatogra-
phy (HPAEC) analyses were performed in 5 mM sodium azide, 50 mMsodium acetate, pH 5.5, at 37 /C176C. Samples were desalted using Carbog-
raph SPE solid phase extraction columns (Alltech Associates, Deer-ﬁeld, IL) according to Packer et al. [26].
To test the eﬀects of inhibitors, 5 mM 1-deoxynojirimycin (Fluka
31128), N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin (Fluka 66570), castanospermine
(Sigma C-3784), freshly prepared
DD-glucono-1,5-lactone (Sigma G-
9766), conduritol- b-epoxide (Biomol Research Laboratories, Philadel-
phia, PA), N-(5 adamantane-1-yl-methoxy)pentyl-deoxynojirimycin
[27], or buﬀer was preincubated on ice for 15 min with MutAp
(0.2lg/ml), glucoamylase (0.5 lg/ml) (Roche 1202332), or glucocere-
brosidase (0.2 lg/ml) (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Remaining MutAp
activity was measured by incubation with carboxymethylated, then re-duced, (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan (1 mg/ml) in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6,
at 37/C176C for 15 min (ﬁnal inhibitor concentration of 250 lM). Remain-
ing glucoamylase activity was measured in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH5.6, containing 5 mg/ml of starch treated according to Zulkowsky (Flu-
ka 85642), at 37 /C176C for 15 min (ﬁnal inhibitor concentration of
250lM). Hydrolysis products were analyzed using the PAHBAH col-
orimetric assay [24]. Remaining glucocerebrosidase activity was mea-
sured with 3.7 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl- b-glucopyranoside in 0.25%
(w/v) sodium taurocholate, 0.1 M citrate, 0.2 M phosphate buﬀer,pH 5.2, at 37 /C176C for 10 min (ﬁnal inhibitor concentration of
500lM). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.3 M glycine-
NaOH, pH 10.6, and the amount of liberated 4-methylumbelliferone
was determined with a LS2 ﬂuorometer (Perkin–Elmer Corp.) at445 nm wavelength. All enzyme reactions occurred in a linear mannerwith the amounts of enzyme used and during the indicated time ofincubation (data not shown).
2.3.
1H NMR spectroscopy
Carboxymethylated a-glucan (0.4 mg/ml) was taken up in 10% deu-
terium oxide, 5 mM sodium azide, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5,and incubated at 37 /C176C for 10 min with MutAp (0.4 lg/ml), as indi-
cated. Mutarotation was accelerated by adding 2.4 M ammonium
hydroxide. Spectra were recorded at 500.13 MHz on a DRX500 instru-
ment (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 10 /C176C. Under these con-
ditions, the proton signal corresponding to water is situated exactlybetween the two anomeric signals of glucose, and, therefore, suppres-sion of the water signal will not disturb signals corresponding to glu-cose. Chemical shifts were referred to internal acetone (
1H: 2.225 ppm).
2.4. Preparation of deﬁned (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan oligosaccharide substrates
One hundred mg of (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan from fruiting bodies of Laetip-
orus sulphureus were resuspended in 98% (vol/vol) formic acid and
heated at 100 /C176C for 10 min. After evaporation of the acid under a
stream of nitrogen, hydrolysis was continued by addition of 0.5 M tri-ﬂuoroacetic acid and heating at 100 /C176C for 12 min, after which the
clear solution was lyophilized.
Products obtained after acid hydrolysis were separated on a Bio-Gel
P4 column (1.6 ·96 cm, BioRad, Hercules, CA). The column was
thermostated at 58 /C176C. Oligosaccharides were eluted with 5 mMammonium bicarbonate at a ﬂow-rate of approximately 5 ml/h and
the eluent was monitored using a Bischoﬀ Diﬀerential Refractometer
(Bischoﬀ Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany). Oligosaccharides
were further puriﬁed to homogeneity by HPAEC. Fractions were de-salted using Carbograph SPE solid phase extraction columns (AlltechAssociates, Deerﬁeld, IL) according to Packer et al. [26].
2.5. Labeling of reducing ends
Oligosaccharide samples were dissolved in 0.5 M ammonium
hydroxide and reduced by adding excess sodium borohydride at20/C176C for 4 h. The excess of borohydride was removed by adding
10% (vol/vol) acetic acid. Boric acid was removed by co-evaporationfrom methanol under reduced pressure.
2.6. High-performance anion-exchange chromatography
The HPAEC system consisted of a Dionex DX 500 apparatus
equipped with a GP 40 gradient pump and an ED 40 electrochemicaldetector (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). A CarboPac PA1 col-
umn (9 ·250 mm, Dionex Corporation) at a ﬂow rate of 4.0 ml/min
was used for semi-preparative puriﬁcation of (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan oligo-
saccharides obtained after partial acid hydrolysis of (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan
and BioGel P4 separation. For analysis of enzymatic hydrolysis prod-ucts, 30-min linear gradients were applied from 0 to 500 mM sodiumacetate in 100 mM sodium hydroxide using an analytical CarboPac
PA1 column with dimensions 4.6 ·250 mm at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 ml/
min. Unseparated (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan oligosaccharides in their native
or reduced forms were used as a ladder to calibrate the analyticalcolumn.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. MutAp hydrolyzes crystalline (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan with
glucose as the main product
To compare the hydrolysis products of MutAp with those of
His-tagged Agn1p, we incubated crystalline (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan
with puriﬁed MutAp or Agn1p-his and analyzed the reaction
products by using two diﬀerent colorimetric assays. The assaywith p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide (PAHBAH) was used to
quantify the amount of soluble reducing ends, whereas that
with glucose oxidase (GOD) was used to quantify the amount
of free glucose. For MutAp, both the PAHBAH and GOD as-says gave similar values, indicating that most reducing ends
(i.e., more than 80%) are produced in the form of glucose.
By contrast, hardly any glucose was released after incubationwith Agn1p-his ( Fig. 1 ). These data are in complete agreement
with previous data on the actions of MutAp and Agn1p-his
[20,21] and demonstrate that, although both enzymes are
members of family GH-71, their hydrolysis products areremarkably distinct.
3.2. MutAp hydrolyzes (1 ﬁ3)-a-glycosidic linkages with
inversion of anomeric conﬁguration
Enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates involves a nucleo-
philic substitution reaction at the anomeric carbon and leads
to either inversion or retention of the anomeric conﬁgurationof the hydrolysis product [28]. To determine the anomeric con-
ﬁguration of the hydrolysis product of MutAp (i.e., glucose),
we incubated carboxymethylated (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan with
MutAp and analyzed the product by
1H NMR spectroscopy.
As a reference, the1H NMR spectrum of an equilibrium mix-
ture of a-glucopyranose ( a-Glcp) and b-Glcpwas included to
assign the signals speciﬁc for the anomeric conﬁguration offree glucose ( Fig. 2 A). The
1H NMR spectrum of untreated
carboxymethylated (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan showed only signals
corresponding to (1 ﬁ3)-linked a-Glcpresidues and signalsC.H. Gru ¨n et al. / FEBS Letters 580 (2006) 3780–3786 3781
corresponding to free glucose were absent ( Fig. 2 B). This spec-
trum was essentially identical to that taken immediately afteraddition of MutAp (data not shown). However, after a 10-
min digestion with MutAp at 37 /C176C, signals corresponding to
b-Glcp(denoted H-1 b) became apparent, whereas a-Glcpsig-
nals remained absent ( Fig. 2 C). As an internal control, we cre-
ated an equilibrium of a-Glcpand b-Glcpby accelerating
mutarotation through addition of ammonium hydroxide andobserved the appearance of signals corresponding to a-Glcp
(H-1a) and a decrease in the b-Glcpsignal ( Fig. 2 D). These re-
sults show that MutAp liberates b-Glcpduring hydrolysis of
(1ﬁ3)-a-glucan, demonstrating that MutAp acts by inversion
of the anomeric conﬁguration.
3.3. A tetrasaccharide is the minimal substrate for MutAp
To identify its minimal substrate, MutAp was incubated
with crystalline (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan. At selected time intervals,
samples were taken and analyzed by high-performance an-
ion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC). At t= 0, virtually
no background peaks were visible, indicating that by ourmethod only hydrolysis products are analyzed (data not
shown). The HPAEC proﬁle of the sample taken after a 1-h
incubation showed two peaks, corresponding to G1
1and
G3 in the molar ratio of 7.5:1 ( Fig. 3 A, upper panel). Increas-
ing the incubation period to 16 h led to an increase of these products but not in a major change in their molar ratio
(Fig. 3 A, lower panel). In addition, we now observed a small
peak corresponding to G2, whereas peaks corresponding to
G4 or higher oligosaccharides remained almost absent.
Together, these data indicate that G3 is a poor substrate forMutAp, whereas G4 is its minimal substrate.0.04 0.08 0.120.00.51.01.5

(1ﬁ3)-a-glucan oligosaccharides; i.e., glucose, nigerose, nigerotriose,
etc. Similarly, the suﬃx –ol indicates the alditol form of these
oligosaccharides.3782 C.H. Gru ¨n et al. / FEBS Letters 580 (2006) 3780–3786
To conﬁrm these ﬁndings more directly, we tested the ability
of MutAp to use puriﬁed (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan oligosaccharides as
a substrate. Puriﬁed disaccharide G2 was not hydrolyzed at all
by MutAp (data not shown), while puriﬁed G3 was hydrolyzed
only poorly to G2 and G1 ( Fig. 3 B). By contrast, puriﬁed G4
was hydrolyzed partially to G3 and G1 after a 1-h incubation,
while after 16 h G4 was cleaved completely into the major
products G3 and G1, together with only a small amount ofG2 (Fig. 3 C). Finally, puriﬁed G5 was hydrolyzed eﬃciently
after a 1-h incubation to the main hydrolysis products G3
and G1, while a small amount of the intermediate product
G4 was also formed, as well as some G2 ( Fig. 3 D, upper pa-
nel). After extending the incubation period to 16 h, G5 and
G4 were completely digested ( Fig. 3 D, lower panel), resulting
in a hydrolysis proﬁle that is similar to that of puriﬁed G4(Fig. 3 C and D, compare lower panels). From these data, we
conclude that MutAp uses G4 eﬃciently as a minimal
substrate.
3.4. MutAp shows endo-hydrolytic activity
To determine whether MutAp starts hydrolysis of its
substrate (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan from the non-reducing end
(exo-hydrolytic activity) or at an intrachain glycosidic linkage
(endo-hydrolytic activity), we explored three diﬀerent ap-
proaches.
First, we tested MutAp activity in the presence of the
exo-glycosidase inhibitors deoxynojirimycin, N-methyl deoxy-
nojirimycin, castanospermine,
DD-glucono-1,5-lactone, con-duritol- b-epoxide, or N-(5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxy)pentyl-
deoxynojirimycin [27]. None of these inhibitors aﬀected the
activity of MutAp ( Fig. 4 A), whereas the activities of the
exo-type control glycosidases glucoamylase ( Fig. 4 B) and glu-
cocerebrosidase ( Fig. 4 C) strongly decreased under similar
reaction conditions. These results are consistent with our ear-
lier ﬁnding that these types of inhibitors do not aﬀect the activ-
ity of the endo-(1ﬁ3)-a-glucanase Agn1p-his [21], suggesting
that MutAp also lacks exo-hydrolytic activity.
Second, we studied the ability of MutAp to hydrolyze
(1ﬁ3)-a-glucan, whose non-reducing and reducing ends had
been modiﬁed to contain aldehyde or hydroxyl groups, by usingperiodate oxidation or periodate oxidation followed by boro-
hydride reduction, respectively. These treatments should render
the (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan inaccessible to exo-type glycosidases,
whereas endo-type glycosidases should remain active because
their internal site of initial attack is located away from the mod-
iﬁed ends [12,15] . Periodate oxidation alone reduced MutAp
activity to /C2440% of control values ( Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 1
and 4). Rather than the partial inhibition observed here, a pre-
vious report described a complete inhibition of MutAp activity
following periodate oxidation of (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan, leading the
authors to propose an exo-hydrolytic activity [20]. An alterna-
tive explanation of the observed decrease in MutAp activity is a
potential inactivation and immobilization of MutAp caused bya reaction of the introduced aldehydes with MutAp through
primary amines in its amino terminus or 19 lysine residues,
forming Schiﬀ bases [29]. Formation of undesirable Schiﬀ basesG1

can be prevented by carrying out a borohydride reduction on
periodate-treated (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan, converting the aldehyde
groups to hydroxyl groups but leaving the ends modiﬁed andtherefore inaccessible to exo-type glycanases. This sequential
treatment of (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan with periodate and borohydride
did not inhibit enzyme activity at all ( Fig. 5 A, lane 2), suggest-
ing that MutAp has endo-hydrolytic activity. As a positive con-
trol, we treated oxidized, then reduced, (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan with
acid (Smith degradation) to completely remove the modiﬁedends, and observed control levels of enzyme activity ( Fig. 5 A,
compare lanes 3 and 4).
Third, to analyze the hydrolysis activity of MutAp directly,
we labeled puriﬁed (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan pentasaccharide at its
reducing end by means of reduction, incubated the labeled sub-
strate with MutAp, and analyzed the hydrolysis products.
HPAEC analysis showed that G5-ol (in eﬀect a tetrasaccharidedue to the ring opening of the reducing residue) eluted as a sin-
gle peak (data not shown). After a 1-h incubation, hydrolysis
products corresponding to G2-ol and G3 were formed(Fig. 5 B, upper panel), whereas after 16 h G5-ol was digested
completely into G3 and G2-ol, together with some G1 and
G2 (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). As a control, G4-ol also was puri-
ﬁed and incubated with MutAp, and, as expected from ourabove ﬁndings ( Fig. 3 C), it hydrolyzed slowly and proved a
poor substrate for MutAp (data not shown). Together, ourresults show that G5-ol is hydrolyzed primarily into G3 and
G2-ol, demonstrating that MutAp hydrolyzes intrachain
glycosidic linkages. Fully consistent with this ﬁnding is theabsence of G4-ol from the G5-ol hydrolysis products, clearly
demonstrating a lack of exo-hydrolytic activity. In summary,
we conclude that MutAp can be characterized as an endo-
hydrolytic enzyme.
3.5. Model for the catalytic mechanism of MutAp
Despite its endo-hydrolytic mechanism of action, MutAp
produces mainly glucose moieties rather than a series of oligo-saccharides of diﬀerent length. This ﬁnding suggests that
MutAp possesses processivity, the process by which an enzyme
remains attached to its substrate after the initial attack, trans-ferring it along its active site (sliding) for multiple rounds ofhydrolysis [30,31] . Processivity is common among b-amylases,
exo-glycosidases which bind (1 ﬁ4)-a-glucan and liberate
multiple b-maltose units [32]. Also a number of endo-glycosi-
dases, such as a-amylases [33–36] and some endo-polygalactu-
ronases from Aspergillus niger [37–40] , display processivity
following the initial random intrachain attack. Regarding theprocessive mechanism of MutAp, we propose a model in which
the enzyme ﬁrst binds to its substrate ( Fig. 6 , step 1) and
hydrolyzes an intrachain glycosidic linkage. Subsequently,the piece with the original reducing end dissociates and isA

then reduced; (3) Smith-degraded; or (4) untreated. The assays are thePAHBAH (black bars) or GOD (grey bars) assays. (B) G5-ol ishydrolyzed readily into G2-ol and G3. Note that no G4-ol is formed. /C3

released into the medium, whereas the other piece remains
bound to the substrate binding site ( Fig. 6 , step 2). The re-
tained piece then slides through the catalytic site for repetitiveattack ( Fig. 6 , step 3), releasing a single glucose moiety in each
round of hydrolysis. In our model, hydrolysis continues until
the substrate is shortened to a trisaccharide ( Fig. 6 , step 4),
which will be released ( Fig. 6 , step 5). This model is in com-
plete agreement with our results on the digestion pattern of de-
ﬁned (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan oligosaccharide substrates ( Fig. 3 ).
These results showed that in G4 the glycosidic linkage next
to the reducing residue is hydrolyzed by MutAp. The same
holds for G5 as a substrate, since the amount of G2 formedafter a short period of incubation is very small compared toglucose (G1) formation. Also G4 is not released into the med-
ium in large quantities, indicating that the tetrasaccharide is
still bound to the enzyme and is hydrolyzed into G1 and G3.
Although MutAp and Agn1p are both endo-(1ﬁ3)-a-glu-
canases, their physiological roles are quite distinct. MutAp is
secreted by a mycoparasitic fungus and its processive mecha-nism may ﬁnd its physiological signiﬁcance in an eﬀective
digestion of fungal cell-wall (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan material, releas-
ing glucose moieties, which may be used as a carbon and en-ergy source. By contrast, Agn1p is secreted during a speciﬁc
stage in the cell division cycle of a unicellular fungus (a yeast)
to hydrolyze a speciﬁc region of the mother cell wall overlayingthe division septum, called the septum edging, and to facilitatethe physical separation of daughter cells [21]. Agn1p lacks pro-
cessivity and produces oligosaccharides with a pentasaccharide
as the main hydrolysis product. This mechanism is consistentwith its physiological role of localized cleavage of cell-wall
(1ﬁ3)-a-glucan rather than complete hydrolysis of this struc-
tural polysaccharide, which might compromise the structuralintegrity of the dividing cell. Interestingly, Agn1p lacks a poly-
saccharide-binding domain, whereas MutAp contains such a
domain at its carboxyl terminus. We hypothesize that the poly-saccharide-binding domain in MutAp may be involved in pro-
cessivity, either by partially disrupting the crystalline structure
of (1ﬁ3)-a-glucan and thereby making it more accessible to
hydrolysis, or by assisting in retention of (1 ﬁ3)-a-glucan
after each round of hydrolysis.Acknowledgements: The authors thank Dr. P.J. Erbel for valuable dis-
