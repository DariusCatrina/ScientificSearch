Investigation of endoglucanase selectivity on carboxymethyl cellulose by mass spectrometric techniques 
Abstract The bene.ts of applying cellulose selec�tive enzymes as analytical tools for chemical structure characterization of cellulose derivatives have been frequently addressed over the years. In a recent study the high selectivity of cellulase Cel45A from Trichoderma reesei (Tr Cel45A) was utilized for relating the chemical structure to the .ow properties of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). How�ever, in order to take full advantage of the enzymatic hydrolysis the enzyme selectivity on the cellulose substrate must be further investigated. Therefore, the selectivity of Tr Cel45A on CMC was studied by chemical sample preparation of the enzyme products followed by mass spectrometric chemical structure characterization. The results strongly suggest that, in accordance with recent studies, also this highly selective endoglucanase is able to catalyze hydrolysis of glucosidic bonds adjacent to mono-substituted anhydroglucose units (AGUs). Furthermore, the results also indicate that substituents on the nearby AGUs will affect the hydrolysis.

Introduction 
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of�.ight mass spectrometry (MALDI�TOFMS) is a valuable tool for chemical structure elucidation of biopolymers. MALDI�TOFMS has been used for chemical structure characterization of partially hydrolyzed methyl cellulose (Momcilovic et al. 2003b), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) (Richardson et al. 2003) and ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose (An�dersson et al. 2004). Recently, MS and tandem MS methods for characterization of cellulose ethers were evaluated (Mischnick et al. 2005). The study showed that electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI�MS) and MALDI�TOFMS, are powerful techniques for investigation of the substituent distribution in the intact polymer. In addition, even more detailed chemical structure information can be obtained by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (Tuting et al. 2004b; Adden and Mischnick 2005; Adden et al. 2006). 
In CMC, variations in the chemical structure greatly affect the product properties (e.g. rheolog�ical properties), hence making it more or less suitable in a speci.c application. These properties 
123 
are known to be affected by, not only the molar mass and molar mass distribution, but also the degree of substitution (DS) and the substituent distribution in the polymer. The determination of the substituent distribution in CMC is still not a straightforward task. 
One attractive approach for characterization of the substituent distribution in CMC is to use cellulose selective enzymes, e.g. endoglucanases, for selective hydrolysis of the glucosidic bonds in the substrate. Due to that the carboxymethyl groups constitute obstacles (e.g. sterical or electrostatic) or hinder the formation of hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the substrate, the hydrolysis will be restricted to regions on the molecules containing no or few substituents. The chemical structure and concentra�tion of the enzyme products will thus depend on the selectivity of the enzyme and on the CMC-substrate structure (e.g. DS and substituent distribution). There are several publications available where enzymatic degradation in combination with different analytical techniques has been applied for the characterization of the substituent distribution in CMC. Gelman combined enzymatic degradation with viscosity measurements and reducing sugar determination (Gelman 1982) while more recent studies included chromatographic techniques (e.g. size-exclusion chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the enzymatic hydrolysates) (Horner et al. 1999; Saake et al. 2000). 
We have recently shown that by enzymatic hydrolysis with Tr Cel45A, it is possible to differen�tiate the substitution pattern in two CMCs displaying large variations in the product properties (Enebro et al. 2007). 
In order to take full advantage of the selective hydrolysis, more information on the endoglucanase sensitivity for substituents on the AGUs involved with the active site is required (Fitzpatrick et al. 2006). 
It has been suggested that endoglucanases require at least two non-substituted AGUs in order to hydrolyze the CMC molecules (Reese 1957; Wirick 1968; Eriksson and Hollmark 1969). However, in a recent study Horner et al. (1999) reported that an endoglucanase from Humicola insolens was able to hydrolyze the glucosidic bond adjacent to a substi�tuted AGU if the substituent was located at the O-6 position. 
There have been a few studies on the selectivity of Tr Cel45A endoglucanase on cellulose derivatives in recent years. Schagerlof et al. (2006a, b) suggested, from studies on HPC and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), that the endoglucanase cannot tolerate hydroxypropyl groups in the active site and that it, in addition, is severely hindered by methyl groups. Furthermore, Cohen et al. (2004) presented a study where CMC was hydrolyzed using six different endoglucanases, including Tr Cel45A, and the olig�omeric products analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-MS. It was concluded that all six endoglucan�ases are able to hydrolyze the glucosidic bond adjacent to a substituted AGU. This conclusion was based on the detection of substituted monomers in the hydrolysates. However, according to their results no substituted monomers were detected for Tr Cel45A. Furthermore, it was found that fully substituted cellotriose was a product from Tr Cel45A hydrolysis. This implies that the active site of Tr Cel45A is insensitive to carboxymethyl substituents, which should lead to substantial hydrolysis of the CMC. However, according to their results from size-exclu�sion chromatography and reducing sugar analysis it was found that the CMC was not extensively hydrolyzed by Tr Cel45A, which has also been shown in another study (Karlsson et al. 2002a). 
To gain further knowledge on the enzyme selec�tivity the substituent locations on the oligomeric enzyme products must be analyzed. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the selec�tivity of Tr Cel45A on CMC by detailed chemical structure characterization. This could be achieved by chemical sample preparation of the enzyme products followed by MALDI�TOFMS and ESI-MS/MS. From our .ndings we are able to present more detailed information regarding the selectivity of Tr Cel45A on CMC. 
Materials and methods 
Chemicals 
A high viscosity grade CMC (DS 0.61, CEKOL 50,000, Lot no. Z0607) was provided by CP Kelco (Skoghall, Sweden). The dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous), NaOH (pellets), NaBH4 and all sol�vents, analytical grades, were from Sigma-Aldrich 
123 
(Stockholm, Sweden). The strong ion exchange resin Dowex 50 W 9 8(H?-form, 50�100 mesh), iodomethane (MeI) and the MALDI matrices 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and 20,40,60-tri�hydroxyacetophenone monohydrate (THAP) were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). LiCl, NaCl and (NH4)2SO4 were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Deionized water was used in the chemical sample preparations while MilliQ grade water from a Synergy 185 UV Ultrapure Water System 
(18.2 MXcm, Millipore AB, Solna, Sweden) was used in the MALDI preparations. 
Enzymatic hydrolysis of CMC 
The CMC was dialyzed using a dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of &12,000 (glob�ular proteins) (Sigma-Aldrich) and deionized water in order to remove any low mass molecules in the sample. The endoglucanase Cel45A from Trichoderma reesei, puri.ed according to Karlsson et al. (2002b), was used for hydrolysis of the CMC according to Enebro et al. (2007). The endoglucanase showed no side activities. 
Chemical sample preparation 
A small volume of the enzymatic hydrolysate (con�taining approximately 5 mg of CMC) was .ltrated through a micro centrifuge .lter (MWCO 10,000) (Pall Norden AB, Lund, Sweden) in order to remove any remaining high mass products. When most of the solution had passed through the .lter, additional water was added (three times) in order to recover as high fraction as possible of the low-mass analytes. The solution was freeze-dried before subjected to the chemical derivatization. 
The hydrolysate was .rst reduced in a 3 mL micro-reaction vessel (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich) by addition of 1mL of 2gL -1 NaBH4 in aqueous ammonia (2 mol L -1) for 5 h under stirring. The solution was evaporated followed by repeated coeva�poration (.ve times) with 15% methanolic acetic acid under a stream of nitrogen in order to remove borate as its methyl ester (Adden et al. 2006). 
The enzymatic hydrolysates were permethylated according to Ciucanu and Kerek (1984) by using alkali powder in DMSO and MeI as reagents. The reduced sample was dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO before addition of 100 mg of powdered NaOH. After 30 min, 20 lL of MeI was added and the solution was stirred at room temperature (RT) over night. In order to maximize the methylation yield of the hydroxyl groups, 50 mg of powdered NaOH and, after 30 min, 10 lL of MeI was added three times in 24 h intervals. 
Twenty-four hours after the last addition of reagents, the excess of MeI was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen at RT for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a separation funnel containing water and the solution was made acidic (pH 1�1.5) by addition of a few drops of HCl. This was done in order to retain the CM-oligomers in their acidic form. The permethylated CM-oligomers were extracted in dichloromethane three times followed by washing of the organic phase with slightly acidic water three times. The dichloromethane was then evaporated under nitrogen and the residue was dissolved in 1 mL of MeOH. A small aliquot of the solution was diluted ten times before addition of a few strong ion exchange beads to the solution and stirring the solution for a few days. The solution was then used without any further puri.cation. Three separate reactions were performed. 
Acid hydrolysis 
A small volume of the reduced and permethylated, but not Dowex-treated, sample was subjected to acid hydrolysis. The methanol was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen before addition of aqueous tri.u�oroacetic acid (TFA, 2 mol L -1), giving a sample concentration of approximately 2.5 g L -1. The hydrolysis was performed by heating the solution to 90 C for 6 h with continuous stirring. Thereafter the acid was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and to the residue toluene was added for co-evaporation with the TFA. This procedure was repeated .ve times. The hydrolysate was then dissolved in water to a concentration of 1 g L -1 and used without further puri.cation. 
MALDI-TOFMS 
MALDI-TOFMS was conducted on a Bruker Ultra-Flex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with a SCOUT-MTP Ion Source (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a N2-laser (337 nm), a 
123 
gridless ion source and a re.ector. Two spectrum acquisition methods were used, both in the re.ector-positive mode. Spectra in the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range of 500�2,000 were acquired with an acceleration voltage of 25 kV and a re.ector voltage of 26.3 kV, while spectra from m/z range of 220�400 were acquired with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and a re.ector voltage of 11.3 kV. The laser intensity was set to the lowest value possible to acquire high resolution spectra. 
The MALDI target spot preparation for the permethylated oligomers was performed by mixing equal volumes of analyte (0.5 g L -1 in MeOH) with the THAP-matrix (10 g L -1 in MeOH). Additional sodium was added to the mixture by addition of a minute volume of NaCl (1.5 g L -1 in MeOH) in order to ensure ionization by sodium. 
The target spot preparation of the unmodi.ed enzyme products and the monomers from acid hydrolysis was performed by mixing the analyte with aqueous DHB (10 g L -1) in a mass ratio of 1:10 (analyte:matrix). A minute fraction of aqueous (NH4)2SO4 was added in order to reduce the high intensity peaks from matrix clusters and analyte molecules with sodium exchanged carboxylate groups (Enebro and Karlsson 2006). Matrix reference samples, using the same preparation but without sample, were also prepared in order to avoid misin�terpretation of the mass spectra due to matrix clusters. 
The analyte/matrix/salt mixtures were vortexed using a Vortex Genie (Scienti.c Industries, Bohemia, NY, USA). Approximately 0.5 lL of the mixture was added on the target plate and was allowed to dry in ambient temperature before insertion into the instrument. 
Spectra were acquired by irradiating 10�20 posi�tions on the sample spot with a total of 500�2,500 laser shots. The spectra were processed using Flex-Analysis software (Bruker Daltonics). 
ESI-MS/MS 
ESI-MS and MS/MS was performed on a Finnigan LCQ (Thermo Fisher Scienti.c, Waltham, NA, USA). The analyte solution (0.25 g L -1 in MeOH containing 2 mmol L -1 of LiCl) was infused into the ESI source via a syringe at a .ow of 5 lLmin -1. The spray voltage was approximately 5 kV and the sheat gas was set to 10 (arb. units). The ion-transfer capillary was set to 175 C and mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode. For collision induced dissociation (CID) helium was used as collision gas. Mass spectra were recorded and processed using Xcalibur 2.0 SR2 software (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA, USA). 
Results and discussion 
The main objective of this study was to investigate the selectivity of Tr Cel45A on CMC by mass spectro�metric structure analysis of the enzyme products. Initially, MS/MS was performed on CM-oligomers not subjected to chemical sample preparation. Inter�pretation of the spectra was very dif.cult due to that several different fragment types were obtained and due to low sensitivity. In order to overcome these limitations, we decided to perform chemical sample preparation of the CM-oligomers by reduction and permethylation. Derivatization of carbohydrates prior to MS/MS increases the sensitivity due to that more volatile organic solvents can be used and facilitates tandem mass spectrometry interpretations (Ikonomou et al. 1991; Reinhold et al. 1995; Kang et al. 2008). In addition, transformation of the charged CM-oligomers to neutral species should signi.cantly enhance the analysis in the positive ion mode (Kang et al. 2008). 
Chemical sample preparation 
The chemical sample preparation was performed in three subsequent reactions. Initially, the anomeric carbon atom in the CM-oligomers was reduced. This was done in order to allow for differentiation between the C/Y and B/Z fragments that can be obtained in MS/ MS (Fig. 1). The reduction should also prevent deg�radation that otherwise may occur under the alkaline conditions of the permethylation (Richtzenhain et al. 1954). The second step involved permethylation of the hydroxyl groups on the oligomers. In MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the permethylated reaction products it was seen that the most intense peaks corresponded to undermethylated oligomers. Furthermore, the number of undermethylations correlated with the number of CM-groups, which was an indication that the carbox�ylic acids had not been transformed to methyl esters. Therefore, a third step was introduced where the carboxylic acids were methyl esteri.ed in acidic 
123 


MeOH, which was prepared by addition of strong cation exchange beads to MeOH. 
MALDI-TOFMS 
In Fig. 2 MALDI mass spectra of the enzyme products before, Fig. 2a, and after chemical sample preparation, Fig. 2b, are shown. The relative peak intensities within each DP are similar in both spectra. 
Fig. 2 MALDI-TOF mass spectra of CM-oligomers from enzymatically hydrolyzed CMC (a) before the chemical sample preparation and (b) after chemical sample preparation. All peaks were identi.ed as sodium ion adducts [M ? Na]? . Peaks corresponding to oligomers with DP 3-7 were identi.ed and labeled. The labeling 41 corresponds to the sodium ion adduct with DP4 (large number) containing one carboxymethyl group (number in superscript). The incorporated .gures display the chemical structures of the CM�oligomers in each spectrum 
This indicates that no DS-selective loss of analyte components occurred during the chemical sample preparation. 
Furthermore, it can be seen in Fig. 2b that the chemical sample preparation procedure was success�ful as all major peaks in the mass spectrum correspond to fully permethylated oligomers. The identical oligomers, with respect to DP and number of substituents, were detected in both mass spectra.

In Fig. 2 it can be seen that cellotriose (30), cellotetraose (40) and cellopentaose (50) are enzyme products but not cellohexaose (60). This observation is in accordance with previous studies where CMC has been hydrolyzed by Tr Cel45A and indicates that the endoglucanase requires a substrate longer than .ve AGUs in order catalyze a cleavage (Karlsson et al. 2002a). It is also seen that the main products are oligomers with few substituents, which is an indica�tion on a high endoglucanase selectivity on the CMC. 
ESI-MS/MS 
In order to obtain information on the substituent positions in the CM-oligomers, ESI-MS/MS was performed. In MS/MS ions of a speci.c m/z (i.e. DP and number of substituents) are selected, fragmented, 
e.g. by collision induced dissociation (CID) and subsequently the charged fragments are analyzed with respect to their m/z. The measured m/z and the fragmentation scheme given in Fig. 1 were used for the identi.cation of the fragments. 
Figure 3 displays the CID-spectrum of cellotetra�ose (40), from chemical sample preparation, where the fragments have been identi.ed and labeled according to Fig. 1. 
It can be seen that the most intense peaks in the CID-spectrum correspond to Y-and B fragments. In addition there are also peaks corresponding to, what we believe are A-and C-fragments. Obviously C-fragments are formed in CID which shows that a reduction of the oligomers is required in order to differentiate between C-and Y-fragments. If the reduction was not performed, it would not be possible 
Fig. 3 CID-spectrum of reduced and permethylated cellotetraose as recorded by ESI-MS/MS. The fragments have been labeled according to Fig. 1 while the number in superscript denotes the number of substituents located at the fragment 
to determine whether these fragments contain the non-reducing or reducing end of the original ion. It has been suggested that cross-ring fragments, e.g. 3,5A-fragments, are formed via B-or C-fragments that contain a reducing end (Spengler et al. 1990; Tuting et al. 2004a). 
Detectable signal in MS/MS was only obtained for oligomers with m/z \ 1,500. From the MS/MS data on the substituted oligomers, it was possible to deduce information regarding the substituent posi�tions. Due to that all B-or Y-fragments still contain either the non-reducing or reducing end of the intact CM-oligomer it is possible to obtain substituent information on the terminal AGUs. 
Figure 4 displays a CID-spectrum of di-substituted cellotetraose (42) where peaks corresponding to fragments of varying DP and number of substituents have been labeled. 
In the CID-spectrum of 42 (Fig. 4) peaks corre�sponding to Y11 and B31 were detected. Evidently, mono-substituted AGUs can be located at the reduc�ing end of the oligomers. Furthermore, a peak corresponding to Y31 was also detected. Thus, mono-substituted AGUs can also be found at the non-reducing end. These observations were recurrent when performing MS/MS on all substituted oligo�mers, with the exception for mono-substituted cellohexaose (61) where no fragments corresponding to substituents at either of the end groups were detected. This may be due to that such oligomers contain a sequence of .ve non-substituted AGUs, and therefore may be further degraded by the enzyme. Although there was evidence on mono-substituted AGUs at the end groups, there were no indications on 


123 


di-or tri substituted AGUs at either of the end groups. In addition, in MS/MS of oligomers with three substituents no B23 or Y23 fragments, or peaks corresponding to neutral loss of tri-substituted dimers, were detected. This indicates that no more than two substituents were present on the two AGUs at either end of the oligomers. In order to further investigate the chemical structure of the reducing and non-reducing ends, acid hydrolysis of the oligomers was performed followed by MS of the monomers thus obtained. 
Monomer analysis 
A small fraction of the reduced and permethylated sample (not Dowex-treated) was subjected to exten�sive acid hydrolysis in order to obtain monomers. Due to that the monomer residues in the oligomers differ in chemical structure after the chemical sample preparation, the monomers obtained from hydrolysis will have different masses depending on their original position in the intact oligomers. Figure 5 displays the chemical structure of the monomers initially located at the non-reducing end (labeled [N]), the reducing end ([R]) and from between the two chain-ends ([B]). The mass of monomers denoted [R] is 16 Da higher than those denoted [N], which in turn is 14 Da higher than [B]. Due to these mass differences the three monomer types can be separated and identi.ed in MS. 
Figure 6 displays the MALDI mass spectrum where the peaks have been labeled according to Figs. 2 and 5. Due to that CM-oligomers with non-methyl esteri.ed carboxyl groups were hydrolyzed, additional peaks originating from H/Na exchanged 

Fig. 5 The monomers formed during acidic hydrolysis of the reduced and permethylated oligomers. The labels indicate the original position of the monomer in the intact oligomers (non�reducing end [N]; between the chain ends [B]; reducing end [R]) 
carboxyl groups were detected. These peaks (labe�led ? Na) were found at Dm/z ? n 22 (n = 1, 2, �) relative to the main series. However, the additional peaks did not interfere with the identi.ca�tion of the analytes. 
In Fig. 6, intense peaks corresponding to non-substituted (10) and mono-substituted (11) monomers from all three monomer types were detected. In addition, intense peaks corresponding to di-substi�tuted [B]-monomers were seen. However, no peaks corresponding to di-substituted [N]-or [R]-monomers were detected. The high intensity of the peaks corresponding to di-substituted monomers (12[B], 12[B] ? Na and 12[B] ? 2Na) compared to the non-and mono-substituted peaks is probably partly due to a high relative abundance and partly due to that the ionization yield increases with the number of sub�stituents (Momcilovic et al. 2003a). Therefore, no conclusions on the quantities of the different mono�mers can be drawn from the mass spectrum. Nevertheless, the results from the monomer analysis 
123 


of acidically hydrolyzed CM-oligomers supported the .ndings from MS/MS, i.e., that the reducing and non�reducing ends were at most mono-substituted. 
Endoglucanase selectivity 
A high viscosity grade (high molar mass) CMC was chosen for this study in order to make it possible to neglect the effect of the original end groups in the polymer (i.e., those present prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis). Therefore, it can be assumed that all end groups in the sample have been formed during the enzymatic hydrolysis and have, therefore, been in contact with the active site of the endoglucanase. Figure 7 illustrates the active site of an endoglucan�ase and the nomenclature of the sugar-binding subsites according to Davies et al. (1997). 
The endoglucanase used in the present study (Tr Cel45A) has been suggested to be highly selective towards CMC (Karlsson et al. 2002a). In addition, the endoglucanase must bind to a cellulose segment longer than .ve AGUs in order to hydrolyze the substrate (Karlsson et al. 2002b). This latter sugges�tion was also supported by our .ndings, as peaks corresponding to cellotriose, cellotetraose and cello�pentaose were detected in the MALDI mass spectrum (Fig. 2), but no peak corresponding to cellohexaose. 

Due to that the substrate�enzyme interaction can be hindered by the substituents, the endoglucanase hydrolysis of the glucosidic bonds in the CMC-substrate will be restricted to locations where there are no substituents, or where the substituents do not interfere with the enzyme�substrate interactions. Therefore, from chemical structure analysis of the enzyme product end groups we can obtain informa�tion on to what extent, the endoglucanase allows for carboxymethyl substituents at AGUs involved with the sugar-binding subsites. 
MS/MS as well as acid hydrolysis followed by monomer analysis of the CM-oligomers strongly indicate that the terminal AGUs of the oligomers may contain up to one substituent. This suggests that the endoglucanase used in our study is able to hydrolyze the glucosidic bond adjacent to at least one mono-substituted AGU. However, we cannot deter�mine from these results whether the endoglucanase is able to hydrolyze the glucosidic bond between two mono-substituted AGUs. Furthermore, there seems to be restrictions in the total number of substituents on the two terminal AGUs at either side of the cleavage point. 
From the results we can conclude that Tr Cel45A does not require continuous non-substituted AGUs in order to hydrolyze the CMC-substrate, but rather has restrictions regarding the number of substituents 
123

allowed at (at least) the four AGUs closest to the glucosidic bond. The indicated restrictions regarding the number of substituents at these AGUs are illustrated in Fig. 8. 
Conclusions 
In this study we present a chemical sample prepara�tion method for facilitated MS/MS of CM-oligomers from endoglucanase hydrolysis. We show that reduc�tion of the anomeric carbon atom at the reducing end of the oligomers is required in order to differentiate between fragments containing the non-reducing and reducing ends of the intact oligomers. Reduction and permethylation followed by extensive acidic hydro�lysis also allows for detailed monomer analysis where monomers located at different positions in the intact oligomers can be differentiated by mass spectrometry. 
Tr Cel45A is able to hydrolyze glucosidic bonds adjacent to a mono-substituted AGU. This is in agreement with a recent study, where it was shown that some endoglucanases are able to hydrolyze glucosidic bonds adjacent to a mono-substituted AGU, if the substituent is located at the O-6 position (Horner et al. 1999). Furthermore, by taking into account the low number of substituents detected on the oligomers by both MALDI�TOFMS and ESI-MS/ MS, it is conceivable to assume that several of the Tr Cel45A subsites are sensitive to substituted AGUs. This is a possible explanation for the apparent high selectivity of Tr Cel45A on CMC compared to other endoglucanases (Karlsson et al. 2002a).
