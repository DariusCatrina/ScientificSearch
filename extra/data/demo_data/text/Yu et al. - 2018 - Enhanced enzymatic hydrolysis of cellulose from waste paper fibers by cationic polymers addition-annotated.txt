Cationic polymers (cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), polyethyleneimine (PEI) or cationic starch (CS)) were used
to enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis of waste paper ﬁbers (WPFs) at 15% (w/w) solids concentration. Results
showed that 0.05 g/L PEI, CPAM and CS resulted in 72.5%, 65.9% and 59.7% conversion of WPFs, increased by
15.4%, 8.8% and 2.6%, respectively, compared with control (57.1%). PEI was shown to have a larger e ﬀect than
CPAM and CS, and generate a total sugar concentration of 73.9 g/L. Improvement in hydrolysis with cationic
polymer addition is attributed to increased cellulase adsorption on cellulose through electrostatic attraction,
rather than enhancement of cellulase activity. A patching/ bridging mechanism of cationic polymer enhance-
ment of cellulose adsorption in cellulose is hypothesized. PEI exhibited maximum cellulose binding for polymersexamined and appears to promote binding through a patching mechanism. CPAM and CS adsorbed a relatively
low cellulase through bridging mechanism. In addition, enzyme loading could be reduced by addition of cationic
polymers to obtain the same glucose yield, especially when PEI was used.
1. Introduction
Production of bio-fuels (ethanol, butanol, etc.) from lignocellulosic
materials is an important way to resolve the current energy and eco-
logical crisis ( Bharathiraja et al., 2017; Gao, Xiang, Chen, Yang, & Yang,
2015 ;Govumoni, Koti, Kothagouni, Venkateshwar, & Linga, 2013 ;
Singh, Krishna, Kumar, & Bhaskar, 2016 ;Tan & Lee, 2015). Lig-
nocellulose is composed mainly of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin.Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses into fermentable
sugars is an important part of lignocellulose bioconversion into bio-
fuels. Waste paper ﬁbers (WPFs) are becoming a prospective raw ma-
terial for producing fermentable sugars by enzymatic hydrolysis be-cause they have high cellulose content, low cost and are readily
available ( Brummer et al., 2014 ;Dubey, Gupta, Garg, & Naithani, 2012;
Subhedar, Babu, & Gogate, 2015 ). It has been regarded as bene ﬁcial
from both a resource and an environmental perspective to produce
sugars by enzymatic hydrolysis of their cellulose fractions ( Adu, Jolly,
& Thakur, 2018 ;Subhedar et al., 2015 ).
Studies of enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose have mainly fo-
cused on operating at low substrate concentration ( ≤10% (w/w)) ( Sun,
Sun, Cao, & Sun, 2016 ;Yang et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015 ). However, the
low sugar concentration after enzymatic hydrolysis is one of the bot-tlenecks for commercialization of biofuels due to the low ethanolconcentration in the fermentation broth, which increases the energy
needed for biofuel recovery ( Ramos et al., 2015 ;Zhao, Dong, Chen, &
Liu, 2013). Many researchers have indicated that carrying out enzy-matic hydrolysis at high solids loadings will be necessary to achieve
high sugar concentrations ( Mohamed, Ghazi, M Nejib, Mohamed, &
Issam, 2016 ;Szabo & Csiszar, 2017 ). In theory, higher sugar con-
centration translates into higher ethanol concentration, and thus makes
the bio-fuels production more economically feasible by reducing energy
use associated with the distillation process ( Kristensen, Felby, &
Jørgensen, 2009). In addition, less process water produces less wastewater ( Hodge, Karim, Schell, & Mcmillan, 2008 ). Unfortunately, enzy-
matic hydrolysis at high solids loadings is facing technical problems.Lacking of free water is one of the major challenges during enzymatic
hydrolysis. Water is important for the interaction between lig-
nocellulose and enzymes since it is directly correlated with rheology,
that is, to viscosity and shear rate during mixing ( Hodge et al., 2008).
Thus, lower water content can cause increased mass transfer limitationsbetween reactants, products and enzymes with high solids concentra-
tion during enzymatic hydrolysis ( Zhao et al., 2013).
Use of additives such as non-ionic surfactants ( Li, Sun, Ge, & Zhang,
2016 ) and polymers ( Wang, Liu, Yang, Chen, & Ni, 2015; Yang et al.,
2015 ) can be an e ﬃcient way to improve enzymatic hydrolysis. Several
additives have been screened for e ﬀectiveness in enhancing cellulose

conversion, including cationic and nonionic polymers ( Akimkulova,
Zhou, Zhao, & Liu, 2016; Strobel, Pfei ﬀer, Blanch, & Clark, 2016 ). Non-
ionic surfactants are a class of well-known additives for improving the
enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. Chen et al. reported
that a nonionic surfactant of Tween-80 could enhance the enzymatic
hydrolysis of ﬁnes from recycled paper mill waste rejects which had a
high mineral content ( Chen, Zhao, & Xia, 2008 ;Min, Bhayani,
Jampana, & Ramarao, 2015 ). The proposed mechanism of action of
Tween-80 in enhancing hydrolysis of paper waste is alleviation of thenon-productive binding of enzyme with the higher a ﬃnity on minerals
(Min et al., 2015 ). Nonionic additives could also improve the enzymatic
hydrolysis of materials that have high lignin content through reduction
of non-productive adsorption of cellulose onto lignin. Lou et al. re-
ported that polyethylene glycol (AL-PEG1000) could enhance the en-
zymatic hydrolysis of a mixture of the cellulose (Whatman ﬁlter paper)
and lignin with the ratio of 7:3 ( Lou et al., 2013). Sipos et al. compared
the enzymatic hydrolysis of di ﬀerent lignocelluloses by addition of
nonionic additives, such as poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) ( Sipos et al.,
2011 ). They found that the degree of enhancement di ﬀered among the
substrates, being highest on steam pretreated spruce (33.6% of lignincontent) with no e ﬀect for steam pretreated corn stover (20.3% lignin
content). In addition, recent study showed that the nonionic surfactantsdid not improve the enzymatic hydrolysis e ﬃciency at 0 and 100 rpm
but could enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis signi ﬁcantly at high agi-
tation rate (200 and 250 rpm) ( Lou et al., 2018).
In this study, waste paper ﬁbers had a relative low lignin content
(18.8%), and the stirring rate was 100 rpm. At high solid concentration,
it is di ﬃcult to improve the mass transfer by using high agitation rates.
In addition, both of cellulase and cellulose have a negative charge thatis expected to in repulsion and decreasing a ﬃnity between cellulose
and cellulase enzymes ( Wang et al., 2015 ). Therefore, cationic polymers
have been recognized as a potential class of additives for improving the
enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose ﬁbers. Lin et al. reported that the
cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (C16TAB) in-
creased the enzymatic hydrolysis of avicel linearly from 42.1 to 61.4%
with increasing surfactant concentration ( Lin et al., 2016). In the work
of Guan et al., the digestibilities were signi ﬁcantly improved showing
20% increase for glucan, and 10% for xylan with addition of cationic
polyacrylamide (CPAM) or poly-diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride
(PDADMAC) ( Guan, Haynes, & Lee, 2014 ). Cationic polyelectrolytes
such as cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), polyethyleneimine (PEI), andcationic starch (CS) possess a positive charge and have been widely
used in papermaking as e ﬀective retention aids based on their charge
neutralization mechanism ( Gaudreault, Cesare, Ven, & Weitz, 2015 ;Li
et al., 2016). Taking this technical advantage, cationic polymers addi-
tion are expected to improve enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose, espe-cially
for high solids concentrations.
In WPFs, the main component is cellulose, which is hydrophilic.
During pulping process, the oxidation bleaching process was carried
out, where the hydroxyl ( −OH) and reducing end of cellulose and
carbonyl of lignin will be oxidized to carboxyl ( −COOH). Under the
condition of enzymatic hydrolysis (pH4.8), the −COOH will ionize to
−COOe, thereby resulting the negative charge of cellulose. The charge
repulsion will a ﬀect the a ﬃnity between cellulose and cellulase. In view
of the charge characteristics of cellulose ﬁber and cellulase, the addi-
tion of cationic polymers appears to neutralize the negative charge of
cellulose, thereby increasing the cellulase binding capacity by electro-
static repulsion. In this study, we explored a way to best utilize WPFs as
a bioconversion feedstock by adding cationic auxiliaries. Three types of
cationic polymers (PEI, CPAM, and CS) were used during enzymatic
hydrolysis at a high solids concentration of 15% (w/w). The e ﬀect of
cationic polymer loading on enzymatic hydrolysis was investigated. Thevariations of cellulase adsorption capacity, zeta potential and atomic
composition of WPFs and cellulase activity with and without cationic
polymers were analyzed to reveal the mechanism responsible for the
beneﬁcial action of cationic polymers in enzymatic hydrolysisapplications.
2. Materials and methods2.1. Materials and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis
The waste paper ﬁbers (WPFs) deinked with alkaline ﬂotation was
kindly provided by Huatai Group (Shandong, China). The ﬁbers were
washed to neutral pH with distilled water and then stored at 4 °C. The
average contents of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, and ash were
61.3%, 7.4%, 18.8% and 6.5%, respectively. WPFs were dried at 40 °C
for 24 h prior to SEM analysis. Then they were coated with gold –-
palladium in a sputter coater (E-1010, HITACHI, Japan). The mor-phological structure was detected by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (S-3400 N, HITACHI, Japan).
Cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM, molecular weight 1000 kDa),
polyethyleneimine (PEI, molecular weight 5 kDa) and cationic starch
(CS, molecular weight 100 kDa) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
CPAM was dissolved in deionized water at 2 g/L.
2.2. Enzymatic hydrolysis
The eﬀect of cationic polymers on enzymatic hydrolysis of WPFs
was investigated. The ﬁbers were hydrolyzed by 18 FPU/g-cellulose for
cellulase and 25 CBU/g-cellulose for β-glucosidase at 48 °C and pH 4.8
with a substrate consistency of 15% (w/w) in a 100-mL reactor made of
polytetra ﬂuoroethylene (PTFE), which was loaded into a large stainless
steel tank after sealing. The system (PTFE reactor + stainless steel tank)was placed in an air oven equipped with a shaft that could be rotated atdiﬀerent speeds to ensure uniform mixing of the liquid and the sub-
strate. The ﬁlter-paper activity of cellulase (Celluclast 1.5 L, Sigma) was
90ﬁlter-paper units (FPU)/mL, and the cellobiase activity of Novozyme
188 (Sigma) was 175 cellobiase units (CBU)/mL. Before the hydrolysisexperiment, the desired amounts of cationic polymers (0.05, 0.1, 0.2
and 0.3 g/L) were mixed well with cellulase for 30 min in a beaker.
Then 10 g of WPFs was put into the PTFE reactor, followed by the
cellulase-polymer mixture. After sealing, the PTFE reactor was rotated
at 100 rpm. The e ﬀect of cellulase loadings on enzymatic hydrolysis of
WPFs was also investigated under optimal cationic polymer dosages.The cellulase loadings were 9, 12, 15 and 18 FPU/g-cellulose. After
hydrolysis, the slurry was mixed and left to equilibrate following ad-
dition of 20 ml water to dilute the glucose for 30 min and make the
liquid easy to transfer.
The transferred liquids were withdrawn and centrifuged at 10,000 g
for
5 min. Then the supernatants were ﬁltered through 0.22- μmﬁlters
and properly diluted for further sugar analysis. The ﬁltrate was col-
lected to detect glucose concentrations by HPLC (Waters 2695e, USA)
using an Aminex HPX-87 P column (Bio-Rad, USA) at 85 °C and a re-
fractive index detector at 35 °C. The glucose yield of the substrate was
calculated from the glucose content as a percentage of the theoretical
glucose available in the substrate. A cellulose:glucose ratio of 1:1.11 (g/
g) was assumed.
2.3. Cellulase adsorption and surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS)
Adsorption of cellulases on WPFs was carried out in 100-mL conical
ﬂasks with di ﬀerent cationic polymer loadings. The substrate con-
centration was adjusted to 5% (w/w) by deionized water. The cellulase
loading was 18 FPU/g-cellulose, which was similar to that used in en-zymatic hydrolysis. The adsorption experiment occurred in a shaking
incubator (150 rpm) at 4 °C for 2 h. At the end of cellulase adsorption,
the liquid-solid mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 gfor 10 min. The
supernatants were ﬁltered through 0.45- μmﬁlters for protein content
analysis. Free cellulase was determined in accordance with the
Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) measurement. A control without anyH. Yu et al. Carbohydrate Polymers 200 (2018) 248–254
249
enzyme was used for background correction. The di ﬀerence between
free and total protein was the bound cellulase.
Samples before and after cellulase adsorption with 0.2 g/L cationic
polymers were washed 6 times with 50 mL of deionized water to avoid
the inﬂuence of free components, and then freeze dried for XPS ana-
lysis. The X-ray photoelectron spectra analyses were carried out using ascanning XPS microprobe (Quantera SXM) equipped with a mono-
chromatic Al-K alpha X-ray source (1486.60 eV, energy width 280 eV)
operated at 23.7 W with a background pressure of 5 9 10
−8Torr.
2.4. Cellulase activity analysis
Cationic polymers were added into the cellulase solution in the
dosage of 0.2 g/L. Then the mixed solutions were incubated at 48 °C for60 h. A total of 1 mL of the mixture was withdrawn periodically, and
the enzyme activity with and without cationic polymers was assayed by
the standard ﬁlter paper assay ( Ghose, 2009 ). One unit of enzyme ac-
tivity is deﬁ ned as the amount of enzyme required to liberate 1 μmi-
cromol of reducing sugar per minute at pH 4.8 and 48 °C.
2.5. Charge density analysis
A particle charge detector (Mütek PCD 03 titrator, Herrsching,
Germany) was used to detect the charge density of the samples with a
standard poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride (PDADMAC) solu-
tion (1mN) or a poly(vinyl sulfate) potassium salt (PVSK) solution
(1 mN), as described in reference ( Wang et al., 2015 ). 0.5 g/L of CPAM
and PEI solutions were prepared in 150-mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks. The
cellulase and cellulase-polymer mixtures were diluted 1000 times in250-mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks. The 0.5 g/L cellulose solution was neu-
tralized by excess standard PDADMAC solution and shaken for 120 minto completely neutralize the surface negative charge of cellulose, after
which the supernatant ﬁltered from the fritted glass ﬁlter was titrated.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Composition and SEM analysis of waste paper ﬁbers (WPFs)
The waste paper ﬁbers (WPFs) were composed of 61.3% cellulose,
7.4% hemicellulose, 18.8% lignin and 6.5% ash. A mass balance lacking
100% is due to the presence of plastics, adhesives, and other organics in
waste papers ( Min & Ramarao, 2017 ). It is noticed that the carbohy-
drates (cellulose and hemicellulose) of WPFs account for 68.7%, in-dicating that WPFs are preferable candidates for bio-ethanol produc-
tion. Min et al. reported that old corrugated containerboard (OCC) had
lower lignin content (4%) and higher ash content (41%) compare with
WPFs in the present study ( Min et al., 2015 ). WPFs used in the present
study were produced mainly from old newspapers. Generally, news-papers were produced using mechanical pulp as a material. During
mechanical pulping process, most of lignin was retained in mechanical
pulp. Therefore, the lignin content in WPFs was relatively high. In
addition, the WPFs were taken from ﬂoatation cell, where most of ink
particles were removed. Thereby, the ash content was relatively low.
The microstructures of WPFs were detected by SEM, as shown in
Fig. 1 . According to Fig. 1(a), the morphology of WPFs are di ﬀerent.
Not only macro ﬁbers but also ﬁnes appeared in raw materials. Some
ﬁbers were curved ( Fig. 1 (a)). Pores ( Fig. 1 (b)) and fragments
(Fig. 1(d)) appeared on the surface of ﬁbers. Moreover, broken ﬁber
(Fig. 1(c)) was observed in WPFs. It has been suggested that disruption
of the highly ordered and tightly packed regions of ﬁber structure fa-
cilitated the enzyme access to cellulose, which was expected to speed
the hydrolytic attack of cellulases ( Arantes & Saddler, 2011). Therefore,
these WPF features are expected to be bene ﬁcial
 for enzymatic hydro-
lysis.3.2. E ﬀects of cationic polymers on enzymatic hydrolysis at high solids
concentration
The eﬀect of CPAM, PEI or CS on enzymatic hydrolysis of WPFs at a
high solids concentration of 15% (w/w) was investigated. Fig. 2 shows
the glucose yield after 60 h hydrolysis with and without cationic
polymers. The glucose yield ﬁrst increased and then decreased with
increasing CPAM, PEI and CS ( Fig. 2 ). This result indicated that a
moderate amount of CPAM, PEI and CS could substantially enhance
enzymatic hydrolysis. The highest glucose yield of 72.5% was obtained
with addition of 0.05 g/L PEI. The second-highest glucose yield of
65.9% was observed with 0.05 g/L CPAM. After this, as the dosages of
CPAM and PEI were increased, glucose yields decreased. Compared to
CPAM and PEI, CS did not noticeably improve the enzymatic hydro-
lysis. Obviously, the increment in glucose yield after adding PEI was
better than adding CPAM or CS at the high solids concentration of
enzymatic hydrolysis. Interestingly, when more than 0.2 g/L of CPAM
was used, the glucose yield was even less than with no CPAM at all.
However, all glucose yields after adding PEI were greater than that of
the raw material. Guan et al. demonstrated that cationic polymers
(CPAM and poly-diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride (PDADMAC))
improved the enzymatic hydrolysis of pulp mill sludge at a solid con-
centration of 10% (w/w), and an increase of 20% in glucose yield was
obtained after 96 h hydrolysis ( Guan et al., 2014 ). An increase in glu-
cose yield of approximately 15% observed in this study was lower thanthat found by Guan et al. The washed pulp mill sludge was composed of
70.6% cellulose, 16.1% hemicellulose, 7.3% lignin and 6.0% ash. By
comparison, the lignin content in WPFs (18.8%) was higher than that in
pulp mill sludge. In addition, the solid loading (15% (w/w)) was high
and hydrolysis time (60 h) was low in this study. These di ﬀerences
likely caused the lower increase in glucose yields for WPF's compared topulp mill sludge with cationic polymer addition. Overall, addition of
cationic polymers provided net increase of the total sugar concentrationto a level appropriate for subsequent fermentation. With addition of
0.05 g/L PEI, the sugar concentration increased from 57.3 g/L to
73.9 g/L. Energy requirement for distillation is signi ﬁcantly reduced if
the ethanol concentration is above 4%. In order to meet this ethanolyield, glucose yield must be at least 8% (w/w) (assuming that an
ethanol yield of 0.5 g/g-glucose). In this study, the highest glucose
concentration of 7.39% was obtained, which was close to 8%.
3.3. E ﬀects of cationic polymers on cellulase adsorption
Mass transfer will be decreased when enzymatic hydrolysis is per-
formed at high solids loadings ( Kristensen et al., 2009), which could
reduce the adsorption capacity of cellulase to cellulose. Therefore, in-
creasing cellulase binding to cellulose is signi ﬁcant for enzymatic hy-
drolysis at high solids concentration. In this study, the cellulase bindingcapacity of WPFs was investigated before and after adding cationic
polymers, as shown in Fig. 3. Cellulase binding was carried out at a
solids concentration of 5% (w/w), which is di ﬀerent from that of en-
zymatic hydrolysis (15%, w/w) due to uniformity of adsorption and
ease of sampling. Earlier studies showed that adsorption achieved
equilibrium in 90– 120 min ( Yu, Tang, Xing, Zhu, & Jiang, 2013 ). In this
study, cellulase binding was performed for 2 h to reach maximum ad-sorption. Fig. 3 shows that the cellulase binding trend was similar for
the three cationic polymers. The cellulase binding capacity of WPFs wasincreased when a suitable dose of cationic polymers was used. This
could, in part, explain the increase in glucose yield after adding cationic
polymers ( Fig. 2). The highest cellulase binding capacity was obtained
by adding PEI; it increased from 30.2 mg/g-substrate (original WPFs) to
37.1 mg/g-substrate with an increase in the concentration of PEI from 0
to 0.2 g/L. The second-highest binding capacity (32.8 mg/g-substrate)
was observed using 0.2 g/L CPAM. CS showed the lowest cellulase
binding capacity (31.9 mg/g-substrate) with a loading of 0.2 g/L.
Therefore, the greatest increase in enzymatic hydrolysis was obtainedH. Yu et al. Carbohydrate Polymers 200 (2018) 248–254

by adding PEI during enzymatic hydrolysis, as illustrated in Fig. 2. After
this point, continuing to increase the dose of cationic polymer (CPAM,
PEI or CS) did not improve cellulase binding capacity. On the contrary,
cellulase adsorption was decreased. This could explain the decrease in
glucose yield during enzymatic hydrolysis at high solids concentration
when more cationic polymer was used ( Fig. 2 ).
XPS analysis revealed a change in elementary composition on the
surface of original WPFs and WPFs with 0.2 g/L cationic polymers ad-
dition before and after cellulase adsorption, which is shown in Table 1.
Carbon and oxygen are the main elements of the WPFs surface. Thetheoretical O/C values of cellulose and lignin are 0.83 and 0.33, re-
spectively ( Pang et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013 ). According to Table 1, the
O/C of original WPFs was 0.61, which falls between 0.83 and 0.33. Itindicates that lignin and cellulose both exist on the surface of WPFs. In
addition, nitrogen was not detected on the surface of WPFs. After PEI orCPAM addition, the nitrogen appeared on the surface of WPFs, in-
dicating that PEI and CPAM were adsorbed onto WPFs. However, ni-
trogen was not detected with addition of CS. This is because CS does nothave nitrogen. After cellulase adsorption, the nitrogen contents of all

samples increased, suggesting that cellulase was bound onto WPFs.
When PEI was added, the increase in nitrogen content was 4.9% (in-
creased from 3.4% to 8.3%), which was higher than adding CPAM
(2.8%), CS (1.9%) and original WPFs (1.1%), respectively. This in-
dicates that PEI could result in more cellulase adsorption onto WPFs,
agreeing with the result showed in Fig. 3.

3.4. E ﬀects of cationic polymers on cellulase activity
Fig. 4 signiﬁes the stability of the cellulase incubated with 0.2 g/L of
CPAM, PEI and CS, respectively for 60 h. Without cationic polymer, the
cellulase activity declined drastically at 48 °C and only 62.4% activity
remained after 60 h incubation. With addition of PEI, a similar reduc-
tion in cellulose activity was observed. When CPAM was added, the
cellulase activity was decreased compared to surfactant free solutions.
The reduction was insigni ﬁcant with reference to the experimental
error. Interestingly, the cellulase activity was slightly increased with CSaddition. It has been reported that some nonionic surfactants have the
function of stabilizing enzymes, and may improve the enzymatic ac-
tivity, stability and prevent deactivation of the cellulase during the
hydrolysis process, thereby increasing the enzymatic hydrolysis. Jia
et al. pointed out the cellulase activity increased by 27.5% with
PEG4000 addition ( Jia et al., 2010 ). Kaar and Holtzapple proposed that
Tween-80 protected the enzymes from thermal deactivation duringhydrolysis of pretreated corn stover ( Kaar & Holtzapple, 2015 ). Cheng
et al. reported that the addition of nonionic surfactant of Triton X-100increased the cellulase activity signi ﬁcantly, which were 3.75-fold of
the control at 96 h of enzymatic hydrolysis ( Cheng, Yu, & Zhu, 2014 ).
However, in our study, no obvious improvement in cellulase activity
was observed with addition of cationic polymers. Fig. 2 showed the
highest glucose yield was obtained as PEI was used, and the secondhighest glucose yield was acquired when CPAM was added. However,
they did not improve the cellulase activity. Therefore, the improvement
in enzymatic hydrolysis of WPFs with addition of CPAM or PEI appears
to be due to their increase in cellulase adsorption onto cellulose.
3.5. Charge density of cellulase-polymer mixtures
Cellulase cocktail (Celluclast), used in this manuscript, contains
various di ﬀerent cellulases (endoglucanase(EG), cellobiohydrolase
(CBH) and β-glucosidase( βG) and hemicellulases (xylosidase) ( Stals,Sandra, Devreese, Van Beeumen, & Claeyssens, 2004 ). Therefore, the
electronegativity of the individual component enzymes depends on the
pH of system. The Celluclast cellulase preparation in this study is de-
rived from Trichoderma reesei, where the dominant protein present in
terms of mass is the cellobiohydrolase Cel7A. The pI of this enzyme
ranges between 3.5 and 4.2 ( Stals, Sandra, Devreese et al., 2004 ;Stals,
Sandra, Geysens et al., 2004). Therefore, under the enzymatic hydro-lysis condition of pH 4.8, Cel7A carries a negative charge. Usually, the
WPFs will have negative charge due to the oxidation bleaching during
pulping process. As shown in Table 2, the charge density of cellulase
was−191μeq/mL. However, the pI of some of the other enzymes will
be well above a pH of 4.8, such as the hemicellulases, and therefore will
be positively charged. In this study, the WPFs were used as the cellu-
losic material, and WPFs has a charge density of −75.5 μeq/mL
(Table 2 ). Due to the fact that both cellulase and cellulosic ﬁbers bear
negative charges, there would be repulsion force between the two,
hence
reducing the cellulase adsorption. Reye et al. have postulated
that cationic polyelectrolytes promote enzymatic hydrolysis by neu-tralizing the repulsive charge between cellulose surface and the enzyme
(Reye, Maxwell, & Banerjee, 2011 ).
CPAM is cationic polyacrylamide; PEI, polyethyleneimine; CS, ca-
tionic starch.
Before enzymatic hydrolysis, the cellulase was mixed well with the
cationic polymers for 30 min. Table 3 shows the charge density of the
enzyme solution mixed with di ﬀerent cationic polymers. The charge
density of cellulase increased with increasing CPAM, PEI and CS dosage
(Table 3). Apparently, the overall negative charge of the enzyme so-
lution was neutralized by the addition of the cationic polymers. Afterthe isoelectric point of cellulase was reached, the cellulase-polymer
system showed positive electric charge with increasing cationic
polymer dosage. It is hypothesized that reducing the negative charge of
cellulase will decrease the repulsive force between cellulase and WPF,
thereby increasing the binding capacity. In addition, the low positive
charge density of the cellulase-polymer system is bene ﬁcial for enzy-
matic hydrolysis because it can increase the binding of enzymes to WPFby electrostatic attraction. When a larger dose of cationic polymer was
used, the cellulose surface will take on a positive charge, which de-
creased cellulase binding capacity by electrostatic repulsion. For thisreason, larger doses of cationic polymers decreased glucose yield at
high solids concentration ( Fig. 2).
CPAM is cationic polyacrylamide; PEI, polyethyleneimine; CS, ca-
tionic starch.
Diﬀerent adsorption modes occur when di ﬀerent cationic polymers
are used; they involve distinct patching and bridging mechanisms as
shown in Fig. 5. Our previous study showed that CPAM could improve
the cellulase treatment e ﬃciency of hardwood kraft-based dissolving
pulp, which was mainly attributed to the patching/bridging mechanism
(Wang et al., 2015 ). Shorter-chain cationic polymers are more suitable
for patching, whereas longer-chain cationic polymers are more suitableFig. 4. Time courses of cellulase activity incubated with cationic polymers in

acrylamide; PEI, polyethyleneimine; CS, cationic starch. All cationic polymers
were added at a concentration of 0.2 g/L.Table 2Charges of cellulase, cellulose, and cationic polymers.

for bridging. CPAM and CS have long molecular chains and therefore
can bind cellulase through a bridging mechanism, as indicated in
Fig. 5 (C). However, short-chain PEI polymers are expected to bond
cellulase through a patching mechanism, as shown in Fig. 5 (B). Com-
pared with the patching mechanism, the binding mechanism in brid-
ging involves steric hindrance due to the characteristics of the long-
chain structure. Therefore, it can be speculated that the increase in
cellulase binding on cellulose observed with PEI is due to a patching
mechanism and is greater than that with CPAM or CS, bonding through
a patching mechanism. Thereby, the glucose yield after adding PEI will
be higher than after adding CPAM or CS, as seen in Fig. 2. CPAM and CS
are both long-chain polymers and they will have the same bindingmechanism. The di ﬀerence in their binding capacity may be due to
their di ﬀerences in charge density. The charge density of CS was 175.7
μeq/g, which was lower than that of CPAM (412.8 μeq/g). Therefore,
CS will bind less cellulase.
3.6. Enzymatic hydrolysis at di ﬀerent cellulase loadings
Under the optimal dosage of cationic polymers (0.05 g/L), four
cellulase loadings were used to evaluate enzymatic hydrolysis at a high
solids concentration of 15% (w/w). The cellulase loadings were 9, 12,
15 and 18 FPU/g-cellulose. Glucose yield increased as the cellulaseloading increased from 9 to 18 FPU/g-cellulose. Under all enzyme do-sage points, enzymatic hydrolysis increased using cationic polymers. In
agreement with previous research results, PEI showed the greatest
improvement in enzymatic hydrolysis for all cellulase loadings. When
cellulase loading was less than 15 FPU/g-cellulose, glucose yield in-
creased rapidly with the use of cationic polymers. However, the in-
crease in glucose yield slowed down when cellulase loading was greater
than 15 FPU/g-cellulose. This indicated that the improvement of en-
zymatic hydrolysis with cationic polymers had reached a maximum.
Therefore, cationic polymers can improve enzymatic hydrolysis mark-
edly under low enzyme loadings. It is known that the price of enzymes
is very high, which has hindered industrialized and large ( Bharathiraja
et al., 2017). From Fig. 6, a relatively low enzyme dosage can reach the
same glucose concentration when cationic polymers are used. For ex-
ample, if 58 g/L of glucose concentration is required, approximately
57% of glucose yield will be achieved when enzymatic hydrolysis is
carried out at 15% (w/w) solids concentration. According to Fig. 6,i n
order to meet above glucose yield, the cellulase loadings are about 18(without cationic polymers), 15 (with CS addition), 11 (with CPAM
addition) and 9.5 (with PEI addition) FPU/g-cellulose, respectively.
4. Conclusions
With addition of PEI, CPAM or CS, the glucose hydrolysis yields at
15% (w/w) solids concentration was improved. After 60 h hydrolysis,
the glucose yield increased from 57.1% to 72.5%, 65.9% and 59.7%
with addition of 0.05 g/L PEI, CPAM and CS, respectively. It is sug-
gested that the improvement in glucose yield caused by cationic poly-
mers may be due to the increase in cellulase adsorption through elec-
trostatic attraction. In addition, when the same glucose yield was
obtained, cationic polymers addition could reduce the cellulase loading,
especially when PEI was used. This may provide practical assistance for
industrialized production of biofuels.
