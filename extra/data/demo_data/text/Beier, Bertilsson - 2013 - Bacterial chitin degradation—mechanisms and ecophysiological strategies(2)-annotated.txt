e-mail: stebe@ebc.uu.seChitin is one the most abundant polymers in nature and interacts with both carbon
and nitrogen cycles. Processes controlling chi tin degradation are summarized in reviews
published some 20 years ago, but the recent use of culture-independent molecular
methods has led to a revised understanding of the ecology and biochemistry of this
process and the organisms involved. This review summarizes different mechanisms and
the principal steps involved in chitin degradation at a molecular level while also discussing
the coupling of community composition to measured chitin hydrolysis activities and
substrate uptake. Ecological consequences are then highlighted and discussed with a
focus on the cross feeding associated with the different habitats that arise because of the
need for extracellular hydrolysis of the chitin polymer prior to metabolic use. Principal
environmental drivers of chitin degradation are identiﬁed which are likely to inﬂuence
both community composition of chitin degrading bacteria and measured chitin hydrolysis
activities.

INTRODUCTION
The occurrence of chitin is widespread in nature and chitin serves
as a structural element in many organisms, e.g., fungi, crus-
taceans, insects or algae ( Gooday, 1990a,b ). Chitin is composed
of linked amino sugar subunits. Similar to cellulose and murein, it
makes a shortlist of highly abundant biopolymers with enormous
global production rates estimated at approximately 1010–1011
tons year−1(Gooday, 1990a; Whitman et al., 1998; Kaiser and
Benner, 2008 ). There are no reports of quantitatively signiﬁcant
long-term accumulation of chitin in nature, implying efﬁcient
degradation and turnover ( Tracey, 1957; Gooday, 1990a ).
In accordance with the abundance and ubiquity of chitin,
chitin-degrading enzymes are also detected in many types of
organisms, such as fungi, bacteria ( Gooday, 1990a ), archaea
(Huber et al., 1995; Tanaka et al., 1999; Gao et al., 2003 ),
rotifers ( Štrojsová and Vrba, 2005 ), some algae ( Vrba et al., 1996;
Štrojsová and Dyhrman, 2008 ), but also carnivorous plants or in
digestional tracts of higher animals ( Gooday, 1990a ).
Bacteria are believed to be major mediators of chitin degrada-
tion in nature. In soil systems, chitin hydrolysis rates have been
shown to correlate with bacterial abundance ( Kielak et al., 2013 ),
but depending on temperature, pH, or the successional stage of
the degradation process, also fungi may be quantitatively impor-
tant agents of chitin degradation ( Gooday, 1990a; Hallmann et al.,
1999; Manucharova et al., 2011 ). In aquatic systems, plating and
in situ colonization experiments convincingly demonstrates that
bacteria are the main mediators of chitin degradation ( Aumen,
1980; Gooday, 1990a ). However, occasionally, dense fungal colo-
nization of chitinous zooplankton carapaces has been observed
(Wurzbacher et al., 2010 ) and some diatoms have also beenshown to hydrolyze chitin oligomers ( Vrba et al., 1996, 1997 ). A
further source of chitin modifying enzymes in aquatic systems are
enzymes released during molting of planktonic crustaceans ( Vrba
and Machacek, 1994 ). Nevertheless, it is not yet clear whether the
enzymes released by diatoms and molting zooplankton react with
particulate chitin to any signiﬁcant extent or if their hydrolytic
activity is limited to dissolved chitin oligomers.
Chitin is the polymer of (1 →4)-β-linked N-acetyl-D-
glucosamine (GlcNAc). The single sugar units are rotated 180◦
to each other with the disaccharide N,N′-diacetylchitobiose
[(GlcNAc) 2] as the structural subunit. In nature, chitin varies
in the degree of deacetylation and therefore the distinction from
chitosan, which is the completely deacetylated form of the poly-
mer, is not strict. Chitin is classiﬁed into three different crystalline
forms: the α-,β-, and γ-form, which differ in the orientation of
chitin micro-ﬁbrils. With few exceptions, natural chitin occurs
associated to other structural polymers such as proteins or glu-
cans, which often contribute more than 50% of the mass in
chitin-containing tissue ( Attwood and Zola, 1967; Schaefer et al.,
1987; Merzendorfer and Zimoch, 2003 ). Chitin is a structural
homologue of cellulose where the latter is composed of glucose
instead of GlcNAc subunits. Also murein in bacterial cell walls can
be considered a structural chitin homologue, as it is composed of
alternating (1 →4)-β-linked GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid
units.
A process is called chitinoclastic if chitin is degraded. If
this degradation involves the initial hydrolysis of the (1 →4)-β-
glycoside bond, as seen for chitinase-catalyzed chitin degradation,
the process is called chitinolytic. Growth on chitin is not nec-
essarily accompanied by the direct dissolution of its polymeric

structure. Alternatively, chitin can be deacetylated to chitosan
or possibly even cellulose-like forms, if it is further subjected
to deamination ( Figure 1 ). Such a degradation mechanism has
been suggested in some early studies ( ZoBell and Rittenberg,
1938; Campbell and Williams, 1951 ). Chitinases and chitosanases
overlap in substrate speciﬁcity, while their respective efﬁciency is
controlled by the degree of deacetylation of the polymeric sub-
strate ( Somashekar and Joseph, 1996 )(Figure 1 ). Besides speciﬁc
chitosanases, also cellulases can possess considerable chitosan-
cleaving activity ( Xia et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, lysozyme has
also been shown to hydrolyze chitin, even if processivity is low
when compared to true chitinases ( Skujin ¸ š et al., 1973 ). Cellulases
can also bind directly to chitin ( Ekborg et al., 2007; Li and
Wilson, 2008 ), but there are no reports of these enzymes actually
hydrolyzing the polymers.
Few studies have compared the quantitative importance of
different chitinoclastic pathways, and the studies available sug-
gest that chitin degradation via initial deacetylation might be
more important in soil and sediment compared to water envi-
ronments ( Hillman et al., 1989; Gooday, 1990a ). The quantitative
importance of different chitinoclastic pathways from a global per-
spective has, to the best of our knowledge, never been assessed. In
the following sections, we will focus on the chitinolytic pathway.The quantitative signiﬁcance of chitin has been recognized for
some time and there has been great interest in identifying pro-
cesses and factors controlling its degradation. Accordingly, the
biochemistry, molecular biology, and biogeochemistry of chitin
degradation have been summarized in reviews published already
some 20 years ago ( Gooday, 1990a; Cohen-Kupiec and Chet,
1998; Keyhani and Roseman, 1999 ). More recently, the devel-
opment and widespread use of culture-independent molecularmethods in microbial ecology have enabled further dissection of
microbial processes controlling chitin degradation in more com-
plex natural environments and diverse microbial communities.
These methodological advances combined with the signiﬁcance
of chitin as a critical link between the carbon and nitrogen
cycles ( Figure 2 ) has led to a revived interest in the quantitative
importance of chitin turnover in marine systems ( Souza et al.,
2011 ).
There is clearly a need for an updated account of the diverse
mechanisms involved in chitinolysis and the ecological con-
sequences of this process for bacteria. A focus on bacteria
rather than all other organisms involved in chitin degradation
is warranted since bacterial chitin degradation takes place in
all major ecosystems and because their metabolism and growth
have such a central role in most ecosystem-scale biogeochemical

cycles. However, also non-bacterial or non-chitinolytic chitin-
degraders will occasionally be mentioned and discussed where
their activities would inﬂuence bacterial chitin degradation. In
light of recent developments in molecular methods, a particu-
lar emphasis will be on how the participation and interactions
of speciﬁc microbial populations and community compositioninﬂuence the process. We further identify gaps in knowledge and
needs for further research.
BIOCHEMISTRY OF CHITIN HYDROLYSIS
Chitin degradation is a highly regulated process, and the
hydrolytic enzymes are induced by products of the chitin hydrol-
yses, GlcNAc ( Techkarnjanaruk et al., 1997 ), or soluble chitin
oligomers (GlcNAc) 2-6(Keyhani and Roseman, 1996; Miyashita
et al., 2000; Li and Roseman, 2004; Meibom et al., 2004 ), depend-
ing on the organism under scrutiny. In contrast to (GlcNAc) 2,
GlcNAc has also been reported to act as a suppressor of chiti-
nase expression in a Streptomyces strain ( Miyashita et al., 2000 )
and this may be because its main origin in natural systems
could be from murein in cell walls rather than chitin ( Benner
and Kaiser, 2003 ). Other factors more generally regulating the
expression of these and other hydrolytic enzymes are nutrient
regime and availability of other, more readily available growth
substrates ( Techkarnjanaruk et al., 1997; Keyhani and Roseman,
1999; Delpin and Goodman, 2009a,b ). The variety of regulating
factors are likely to reﬂect the wide range of ecological nichesoccupied by chitin degraders.
Complete lysis of the insoluble chitin polymer typically con-
sists of three principal steps (1) cleaving the polymer into water-
soluble oligomers, (2) splitting of these oligomers into dimers,
and (3) cleavage of the dimers into monomers. The ﬁrst two
steps are usually catalyzed by chitinases. The occurrence of chiti-
nases in bacteria is widespread among phyla and the productionof multiple chitinolytic enzymes by individual bacterial strains
appear to be a common trait (e.g., Fuchs et al., 1986; Romaguera
et al., 1992; Saito et al., 1999; Shimosaka et al., 2001; Tsujibo
et al., 2003 ). Chitinases are typically grouped into family 18 and
19 glycoside hydrolases. The latter are rare in bacteria except for
some members of the genus Streptomyces (Ohno et al., 1996; Saito
et al., 1999; Watanabe et al., 1999; Shimosaka et al., 2001; Tsujibo
et al., 2003 ). It has been hypothesized that family 18 and 19 gly-
coside hydrolases have evolved separately, as genes belonging to
these two analogous gene families show little or no sequence
homology, nor share the same molecular-level catalytic mech-
anism ( Perrakis et al., 1994; Davies and Henrissat, 1995; Hart
et al., 1995 ) .T h eo c c u r r e n c eo fm u l t i p l eg e n e si nas i n g l eo r g a n -
ism may be the result of gene duplication or acquisition of genes
from other organisms via lateral gene transfer ( Hunt et al., 2008 ).
In support of the former mechanism, different chitinase gene
sequences found within single organisms are often almost identi-
cal. However, there are examples where chitinase genes coexisting
in a single organism are very different and cluster with chiti-
nase sequences from rather distantly related organisms ( Saito
et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 1999; Karlsson and Stenlid, 2009 ).
This suggests lateral gene transfer also between distantly related
organisms.
Multiple chitinases within a single organisms are believed to
lead to a more efﬁcient use of the respective substrate as a result
of synergistic enzyme interactions or contrasting afﬁnities to dif-
ferent substrate forms ( Svitil et al., 1997 ). One example of this
is the extensively studied chitinase system of Serratia marcescens ,
which is based on several chitinases with slightly different func-
tions. S. marcescens produces four family 18 chitinases ChiA,
ChiB, ChiC1, and ChiC2, all of which are released into the sur-
rounding medium ( Suzuki et al., 1998 ). ChiC2 results from a
posttranslational modiﬁcation of ChiC1 ( Gal et al., 1998; Suzuki
www.frontiersin.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 149 |3
Beier and Bertilsson Bacterial chitin degradation
et al., 1999 ) and hydrolytic activities of ChiC2 were lower on
crystalline substrates compared to ChiC1 whereas no further dif-
ferences were identiﬁed ( Suzuki et al., 1999 ), leaving the function
of ChiC2 unclear. By combining ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC1, syner-
gistic effects on chitin degradation have been observed, implying
differential action sites and/or molecular reaction mechanisms for
the three enzymes ( Suzuki et al., 2002 ). Indeed it was later shown
that ChiC is a non-processive endoenzyme that cleaves the chitinpolymer randomly, whereas both ChiA and ChiB are processive
enzymes cleaving off disaccharides while sliding along the chitin
polymer ( Horn et al., 2006; Sikorski et al., 2006 ). Multiple action
mechanisms are also implied for each of the latter two chiti-
nases as it has been demonstrated that ChiA and ChiB degrade
β-chitin microﬁbrils unidirectionally from opposite ends of the
polymer ( Hult et al., 2005 ). Still, the major end products from
all three enzymes are disaccharides, whereas monosaccharides are
produced as byproducts in substantially lower amounts ( Horn
et al., 2006 ). There are other examples where multiple enzymes
within an organism catalyze the metabolism of a single sub-
strate, with cellulose as a pertinent example ( Rabinovich et al.,
2002 ). It seems conceivable that enzyme multiplicity might be
a general feature in polymer degrading processes caused by the
structural complexity of the substrate. This would then allow par-
allelized or successive contrasting modes of action on the same
polymer.
β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidases, usually afﬁliated with family
20 glycoside hydrolases, ﬁnally cleave GlcNAc from the non-
reducing end of the water soluble chitin oligomers produced by
chitinases ( Scigelova and Crout, 1999 ). In bacteria, this last step
typically takes place in the cytoplasm or the periplasmic space
(Bassler et al., 1991; Keyhani and Roseman, 1996; Drouillard
et al., 1997; Techkarnjanaruk and Goodman, 1999 ). In some bac-
teria, enzymes other than the family 20 glycoside hydrolases are
involved in hydrolyzing GlcNAc from chitin oligomers ( Tsujibo
et al., 1994; Chitlaru and Roseman, 1996; Park et al., 2000 ).
Recent research also suggests that some family 20 glycoside hydro-
lases can cleave GlcNAc directly from chitin polymers and hence
function as chitinases ( LeCleir et al., 2007 ).
Chitin degradation is also inﬂuenced by more cryptic fac-
tors. For example, a chitin-binding protein without any catalytic
domain has been shown to facilitate the degradation of β-chitin
by disrupting the crystalline chitin polymer structure ( Vaaje-
Kolstad et al., 2005 ). The protein showed signiﬁcant sequence
similarity to a gene product in Streptomyces olivaceoviridis known
to have high afﬁnity to α-chitin ( Schnellmann et al., 1994 ). It
has been proposed that the ability to produce such proteins with
high speciﬁc afﬁnity to a certain crystalline chitin structure may
be decisive for the ability of bacteria to differentiate and react
to speciﬁc crystalline chitin structures ( Svitil et al., 1997 ). Such
chitin-binding domains may also inﬂuence chitin degradationindirectly by facilitating adhesion of cells to chitinous substrates,
a trait that is of particular importance in aquatic environments
(Montgomery and Kirchman, 1993, 1994; Pruzzo et al., 1996 ).
Since the insoluble chitin polymer has to be cleaved outside
of the bacterial cell barrier, metabolic use of chitin also relies
on efﬁcient uptake systems for hydrolysis products. In some
cultivated bacterial strains, PTS (phosphoenolpyruvat: glycosephosphotransferase system) transporters are responsible for the
main GlcNAc uptake. However, the uptake activity of other spe-
ciﬁc GlcNAc transporters as well as transporters with a broader
substrate range (including sugar monomers like glucose, glu-
cosamine, fructose and mannose) have also been described
(Mobley et al., 1982; Postma et al., 1993; Bouma and Roseman,
1996 ). The quantitative importance of these two substrate uptake
strategies, highly speciﬁc or more versatile, is not clear and cul-
ture independent assays based on inhibition experiments provide
contrasting results concerning the speciﬁcity of GlcNAc-uptake
systems. Whereas Riemann and Azam (2002) found a speciﬁc
inhibition of the bacterial GlcNAc-uptake by glucose, this was
not the case in an earlier study by Vrba et al. (1992) .R e a s o n sf o r
such conﬂicting results could be a different set of organisms being
present at the respective sampling sites, i.e., due to the differ-
ent environment under scrutiny in the respective study (marine
vs. freshwater) or seasonal differences in nutrient status of the
system.
Radiotracer studies in lake water suggest differentiation in
GlcNAc and (GlcNAc) 2uptake among phylogenetic groups of
bacteria with the (GlcNAc) 2uptake being quantitatively more
important ( Beier and Bertilsson, 2011 ). This implies that the two
hydrolysis products are taken up by different transporter systems
in freshwater ecosystems. The earlier discussed role of (GlcNAc) 2
as main hydrolysis product of chitinases ( Horn et al., 2006 )a n d
t h eq u a n t i t a t i v ei m p o r t a n c eo ft h e( G l c N A c ) 2uptake mentioned
above ( Beier and Bertilsson, 2011 ) corroborates the observation
that bacterial β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidases are often intracellu-
lar enzymes. Consequently, the relevance of (GlcNAc) 2transport
through the cell barrier during the process of chitin degradation
is evident.
SPECIES INTERACTIONS DURIN G CHITIN DEGRADATION IN
DIFFERENT HABITATS
Particles that contain chitin can act as a source of chitin degra-
dation intermediates to the surrounding medium ( Smith et al.,
1992; Kirchman and White, 1999 ). This implies that chitinolytic
bacteria sometimes process more chitin polymers than they are
able to use themselves. For instance, only a minority of cells in
a pure culture of Pseudoalteromonas S91 growing on chitin as a
sole source of carbon and nitrogen hydrolyzed chitin ( Baty et al.,
2000a,b ). It was assumed that cells with no apparent chitinase
activity fed on hydrolysis products produced in excess by the
chitinase-positive subpopulation. This type of multicellular coop-
eration is a strategy often observed in bacteria ( Shapiro, 1998 )a n d
has been described for several chitinolytic strains ( Gaffney et al.,
1994; Chernin et al., 1998; DeAngelis et al., 2008 ). Considering
the complexity of the chitinolytic cascade, with approximately 50
different proteins being induced ( Keyhani and Roseman, 1999;
Li and Roseman, 2004; Meibom et al., 2004 ), a partitioning of
the clonal population into a chitinase up-regulated subpopulation
that supply hydrolysis products to their kin could be a success-
ful survival mechanism. Such intraspeciﬁc cross-feeding might
also explain the excess enzymatic activity observed on particles in
aquatic systems ( Smith et al., 1992; Kirchman and White, 1999 ).
However, in natural environments, the release of hydrolysis prod-
ucts would not only serve speciﬁc clonal populations, but also
Frontiers in Microbiology | Terrestrial Microbiology June 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 149 |4
Beier and Bertilsson Bacterial chitin degradation
open up the possibility for interspeciﬁc cross-feeding. The exis-
tence of interspecies cross-feeding therefore seems plausible and
studies on bacterial pure cultures have indeed demonstrated that
there are organisms that grow on GlcNAc ( Kaneko and Colwell,
1978 )o r( G l c N A c ) 2(Keyhani and Roseman, 1997 )w i t h o u tp o s -
session of the enzymes for chitinolytic activity.
The habitat structure in which polymer degradation takes
place might have great consequences for this kind of interspeciesinteractions. The ﬂux of dissolved substances as hydrolyses prod-
ucts is physically constrained in aerated soils. Accordingly hydrol-
yses products will remain in close spatial proximity to the place
of enzymatic action. In terrestrial systems, interspecies metabolic
interactions will therefore likely be limited to organisms growing
directly adjacent to each other in bioﬁlms. Besides commensal
sharing of such hydrolysis products ( Everuss et al., 2008 )t h e r e
is also a potential for specialized interactions between organisms
such as synergistic coupling and the recently described parasitism
that rely on bi-directional exchange of e.g., metabolic inhibitors
and chitin degradation intermediates among speciﬁc bacterial
populations ( Jagmann et al., 2010 ). In contrast, released hydrol-
yses products in aquatic systems will be subject to transport by
diffusion and hydrological ﬂow away from the site where hydrol-
ysis took place. Because of the facilitated transport of hydrolysis
products away from the hydrolytic site, quantitatively signiﬁ-
cant cross-feeding events can occur over longer distances in this
biome as observed previously ( Cho and Azam, 1988; Beier and
Bertilsson, 2011; Eckert et al., 2013 ). Thus, it seems likely that
such long-distance cross-feeding relationships could favor rather
unspeciﬁc and unidirectional commensal interactions, where thereceiving organism is less likely to critically depend on the inter-
action. Sediments or waterlogged soils in wetlands may represent
habitats with intermediate transport constraints, locally shar-
ing transport characteristics with both environments outlined
above.
To the best of our knowledge, no studies exist that target
species interactions during chitin degradation in soil environ-
ments speciﬁcally, nor are we aware of studies that compare
the above suggested general differences in cross-feeding between
aquatic and terrestrial habitats. However, a number of culture-
independent studies in aquatic environments that quantify the
fraction of chitin degraders vs. chitin consumers in the total
bacterial community support the existence of signiﬁcant cross-
feeding during chitin degradation ( Ta b l e 1 ): chitinolytic organ-
isms were estimated to represent 0.1–5.8% (average about 1%)
of all prokaryotes in a variety of aquatic ecosystems ( Cottrell
et al., 1999; Beier et al., 2011 ). An even lower fraction of cells
displayed active chitinolytic activity in natural aquatic habitats
(0–1.9%) ( Beier and Bertilsson, 2011; Beier et al., 2012 ). In
contrast, between 4 and 40% of the bacteria, or one third of
the DNA-replicating bacteria, were shown to incorporate chitinhydrolysis products ( Nedoma et al., 1994; Riemann and Azam,
2002; Beier and Bertilsson, 2011; Eckert et al., 2013 ).
The assumption that the uptake of polymer-derived metabo-
lites in aquatic system often occurs over longer distances is
supported by the observation that typically free-living bacterial
groups appear to be quantitatively important receivers of this
hydrolyzed material ( Cho and Azam, 1988; Beier and Bertilsson,2011; Eckert et al., 2013 ). For such long-distance substrate
acquisition, the free-living organisms receiving the hydrolysis
products are likely to proﬁt from the action of other hydrolytic
bacteria that are in close proximity to the polymeric substrate:
any hydrolytic enzymes produced by free living cells across such
long distances would have a low probability of encountering the
substrate and even in this case the majority of resulting hydrolysis
products would not be encountered by the free-living cell. Modelﬁndings indicate that the area around a polymer-hydrolyzing
bacterium, from which hydrolysate can be efﬁciently collected,
is limited to approximately 10 μmd i s t a n c ef r o mt h ep o l y m e r i c
source ( Vetter et al., 1998 ). Free-living bacteria might occasionally
be within this distance to a chitinous particle, but it is uncer-
tain whether the gain from such occasional degradation product
uptake can balance the costs for maintenance of the polymer
hydrolyzing machinery. On the other hand, it has recently been
demonstrated that a member of the typically free-living lineage
Actinobacteria ac1 hosts genes to take up GlcNAc while also
encoding a chitinase gene ( Garcia et al., 2013 ). However, it still
remains to be demonstrated, whether or not these gene products
can solubilize polymeric chitin.
Because of the more pronounced dilution of the released
hydrolyses products in aquatic systems, a successful receiving
organism residing such a long distance from the polymer hydrol-
ysis site would likely also feature high afﬁnity uptake systems.
In agreement with this idea, Boyer (1994)
observed radiolabeled
chitin degradation intermediates in sediment but not in water
after incubating both type of samples with14C labeled chitin. This
suggests that organisms with higher substrate afﬁnity are presentin the water samples compared to organisms present in the sedi-
ment. It remains to be tested whether the remaining intermediates
in sediments would be metabolized over longer timescales or
become resistant to further degradation by diagenetic processes.
It is also unknown, whether organisms with high substrate afﬁn-
ity inﬂuence the efﬁciency of polymer degradation or if they are
irrelevant for the overall ecosystem functioning.
TAXONOMIC IDENTITY OF CHI TINOCLASTIC ORGANISMS
Qualitative characterization of the chitinolytic community by
means of culture-independent molecular methods such as PCR
ampliﬁcation of chitinase genes or metagenomic approaches usu-
ally results in a rather rough level of identiﬁcation. This is due to
the supposedly extensive lateral gene-transfer and the limited tax-
onomic coverage of characterized reference organisms. One con-
sequence of this is that a large number of chitinase gene sequences
cannot be clearly afﬁliated to speciﬁc taxa. However, at a broader
phylogenetic resolution recent studies in aquatic environments
indicate that group A chitinases were by far the most abundant
phylogenetic subgroup of family 18 glycoside hydrolases ( Beier
et al., 2011 ). More detailed information about the taxonomic
identity of microorganisms that consume the chitin degrada-
tion products can be obtained by either cultivation approaches
or by using radiotracer techniques. The bias inherent in stud-
ies that describe natural bacterial communities using exclusively
cultivation-dependent approaches are well-known ( Amann et al.,
1995 ), but the bias appear to be of quantitative rather than
qualitative concern.

In aquatic systems, Cytophaga-Flavobacteria are known to
proﬁt from chitin addition and have been detected in dense clus-
ter on chitinous particles where they also assimilate chitin hydrol-
ysis products ( Cottrell and Kirchman, 2000; Beier and Bertilsson,
2011 ). This suggests a central role of Cytophaga-Flavobacteria
in aquatic chitin degradation where they also beneﬁt from this
material as a substrate. In contrast, in soil environments bacte-
ria afﬁliated with Actinomyces are often identiﬁed as being active
chitin degraders, as they display enhanced growth and activity
upon chitin addition. Members of this phylum are also frequently
recovered in cultivation dependent studies of chitin degraders
(Metcalfe et al., 2002; Manucharova et al., 2011 ). However, in
both of these biomes, chitinoclastic bacteria from other phy-
logenetic groups, including Proteobacteria and Firmicutes ,a r e
also commonly observed ( Cottrell et al., 2000; Brzezinska and
Donderski, 2006; Yasir et al., 2009 ). The high phylogenetic diver-
sity within the frequently isolated chitinolytic bacteria may there-
fore reﬂect a high ecological diversity of chitin degraders and
could also explain why chitin does not accumulate in nature, but
instead seems to be degraded under all possible environmental
conditions ( Tracey, 1957; Gooday, 1990a ).
The composition of the chitin utilizing community—
including active degraders and organisms proﬁting from cross-

plausible that i.e., gram-positive chitin consumers use a higher
percentage of GlcNAc in anabolic processes to synthesize the
murein needed in abundance for production of their cell wall,
while gram-negative bacteria might allocate more of these sub-
strates to catabolic energy acquisition. Indeed, the fraction of
hydrolyzed chitin respired to CO 2in natural ecosystems varies
considerably between 30 and 93% ( Ta b l e 2 ). Whereas the pres-
ence of other substrates has been shown to inﬂuence mineral-
ization rate of GlcNAc ( Mobley et al., 1982 ), it remains to be
determined if the species composition of chitin consumers, as
speculated above, has any signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the actual chitin
mineralization rates.T able 2 | Fraction of hydrolyzed chitin that is mineralized.

Since the taxonomic identity of the chitin-degrading and
chitin-utilizing organisms might be decisive to ecosystem func-
tioning, i.e., as outlined above for mineralization rates of chitin,
it seems important to learn more about key players involved
in different environments. One feasible strategy might be to
combine designed experiments with single-cell isotope tracer
methods. Another option is the direct coupling of chitin degra-
dation traits to other metabolic features and taxonomic afﬁliation
via single cell genome sequencing of uncultured microorganisms
(Stepanauskas and Sieracki, 2007 ).
DYNAMICS OF THE CHITINOLYTIC COMMUNITY
STRUCTURE AND CHITIN DEGRADATION RATES
Chitin degradation is a regulated trait and chitin degraders will
be able to also metabolize other substrates than chitin. Therefore,
the coupling between the abundance and composition of the
chitinolytic community and their collective hydrolytic activity
might not always be strong. A number of different methods,
Frontiers in Microbiology | Terrestrial Microbiology June 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 149 |6
Beier and Bertilsson Bacterial chitin degradation
such as weight loss,14C labeled chitin tracer experiments or
incubation experiments with colorimetric or ﬂuorogenic sub-
strate analogs, have been applied to measure hydrolytic activ-
ity during chitin degradation. Due to the variety of different
methods applied, measuring i.e., potential or actual rates, indi-
vidual values for chitin hydrolytic activity in different studies
are difﬁcult to compare directly ( Ta b l e s 3 ,4). Instead we will
describe trends in environmental control of chitin degrada-
tion detected consistently across several studies and if possible
compare these patterns to shifts in the chitinolytic community
composition. All methods for activity measurements have in
common that they do not differentiate between different organ-
isms hydrolyzing the chitin. Depending on the method used, also
enzymes other than chitinases, such as chitosanases, β-N-acetyl-
hexosaminidases or lysozymes might contribute to the measured
rates ( Höltje, 1996; Vrba et al., 1996 ). Community shifts are
in most cases detected by molecular analyses of group A chiti-
nases of the family 18 glycoside hydrolase ( Ta b l e 5 ). Bacterial
as well as non-bacterial organisms capable of chitin hydroly-
sis, such as those that possess β-N-acetyl-hexo saminidases and
lysozyme are also frequently carrying group A chitinase genes.The targeted group A chitinases can thus also include genes from
fungi, algae and higher animals ( Hobel et al., 2005; Beier et al.,
2012 ). Therefore, most organisms that contribute to the mea-
sured chitinolytic process should be included in the community
analyses.
Temperature is often considered as a critical factor controlling
chitin degradation rates. There are several reports of variation inchitin degradation rates with the highest activity during periods
of high in situ temperature ( Hood and Meyers, 1977; Rodríguez-
Kábana et al., 1983; Hillman et al., 1989; Gooday et al., 1991;
Ueno et al., 1991; Boyer, 1994; Metcalfe et al., 2002 ). Analogously,
observations that different chitinoclastic strains were isolated
during different seasons provided support that temperature could
also affect the composition of the chitinoclastic community
(Warnes and Rux, 1982 ). In some of these studies reporting tem-
perature dependency for chitin hydrolysis rates, substrate avail-
ability might have been a cryptic underlying factor driving the
observed correlation. In aquatic ecosystems for example, chiti-
nous zooplankton can be dominant contributors to polymeric
chitin and are known to increase seasonally in response to warmer
temperature. In agreement with this, Beier et al. (2012) recently
detected pronounced seasonal dynamics in the chitinolytic com-
munity using cultivation-independent molecular methods, but
it was not evident from this study if temperature or alternate
autocorrelated environmental factors such as chitin supply via
crustacean zooplankton were the major environmental factors
driving the community shifts.
There are also studies that revealed that temperature seems
to play a minor role: in the Y ork River, the correlation between
chitin degradation and temperature was much less evident in the
water column compared to the sediments ( Boyer, 1994 ). Further
exceptions are reported for the North Sea where higher chitin
degradation rates were observed in October/November com-
pared to the warmer period during July/August ( Gooday et al.,
1991 ). Also in these studies, however, chitin availability seemed

to have inﬂuenced chitin degradation rates, as maximum chiti-
nase activity coincided with high abundances of chitin-containing
organisms ( Kirchman and White, 1999; LeCleir and Hollibaugh,
2006 ). In aquatic systems, the water-sediment interface represents
a habitat where chitin accumulates as a result of sedimentation
of chitinous particles. This environment is usually also identi-
ﬁed as a hotspot for chitin degradation when compared to the
w a t e rc o l u m no rt h eb u l ks e d i m e n t( Hood and Meyers, 1977;
Warnes and Rux, 1982; Gooday et al., 1991 ). In soils, decreasing
chitinase activity has been observed over depth and, this pattern
has been attributed to the higher presence of chitin-containing
organisms in the upper soil layers ( Rodríguez-Kábana et al., 1983;
Ueno et al., 1991 ). A direct coupling of chitin concentration andthe chitinolytic community has also been demonstrated in an
experiment where chitin-amendment of a soil caused an increase
in chitinase gene copy numbers ( Xiao et al., 2005; Kielak et al.,
2013 ).
Only a few studies have directly related measured hydrolysis
rates to shifts on the chitinolytic community: It has for exam-
ple been shown that high chitinase activity measured after a
soil was amended with sludge or chitin was accompanied by a
decrease in the diversity of chitinases ( Metcalfe et al., 2002; Kielak
et al., 2013 ). Two recent studies in a terrestrial and an aquatic
environment also reported a signiﬁcant correlation between chiti-
nase gene copy numbers and measured chitin hydrolysis rates
(Brankatschk et al., 2011; Köllner et al., 2012 ). A correlation

Beier and Bertilsson Bacterial chitin degradation
between changes in the composition of the chitinolytic com-
munity and chitin hydrolysis rates has also been observed in a
temporal survey of lake bacterioplankton ( Beier et al., 2012 ),
which indicates that apart from environmental factors also the
community composition per se could be decisive for measured
rates.
In summary, the available data suggest that temperature
and chitin supply are important environmental factors con-trolling both chitin hydrolysis rates and the chitinolytic com-
munity structure. This further implies the existence of a link
between dynamic shifts in the chitinolytic community and
measured chitin hydrolysis rates across spatially or tempo-
rally connected habitats. Based on these observations, we spec-
ulate that organisms that contribute in signiﬁcant ways to
chitin degradation may in fact be specialized on chitin sub-
strate use even if they likely also are able to metabolize other
substrates.
Environments with limited connectivity or gene ﬂow, such
as systems located in different climate zones or systems that
vary in salinity, have been shown to host dramatically dif-
ferent chitinolytic communities ( Terahara et al., 2009; Beier
et al., 2011; Manucharova et al., 2011 ). Recent evidence sug-
gests that such isolated communities are adapted to the local
prevailing conditions, as it was shown that the temperature opti-
mum for maximal chitin degradation in soil was strongly cor-
related to the climate zone where the samples originated from
(Manucharova et al., 2011 ). There may, however, still be con-
straints on such local adaptation, as suggested by Kang et al.
(2005) who demonstrated a signiﬁcant positive correlation of
β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activities in wetlands with the annual
mean temperature of the respective system. Future molecular
studies targeting expression patterns for chitinases coupled to
the presence of chitinase genes and measured rates would no
doubt greatly increase our ability to decipher the mechanisms and
controls underlying the process of chitin degradation, not least
by identifying key players and their sensitivity to environmental
change.CONCLUDING REMARKS
In the previous sections, mechanisms and ecophysiological strate-gies of microbial chitin degradation and the role of parameters,
such as temperature and chitin supply in determining chitin
degradation rates have been discussed along with an account
of compositional variation in chitinoclastic communities. The
absence of long-term accumulation of chitin in natural systems
implies that de novo production of chitin is the ultimate limitingfactor controlling its degradation and turnover in nature. Still, the
fate of this material with regards to production of new biomass or
complete mineralization to inorganic constituents varies to a con-
siderably and the underlying factors controlling this variation are
only marginally understood. Besides the presence of other, more
readily degraded substrates, also the composition of the bacterial
community involved into chitin utilization could inﬂuence the
fraction of chitin being mineralized, i.e., by the substrate afﬁnity
toward hydrolyses products. Habitat structure might determine
such general characteristics of the inherent chitin utilizing com-
munity and therefore also dictate the fate of chitin in terms of
its mineralization rates. This may have major implications for
the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in food webs i.e., by carbon
or nitrogen removal due to mineralization and volatilization. We
therefore conclude that the interactive roles of habitat and the
chitinolytic or chitin utilizing community and their taxonomic
identiﬁcation merits further investigation.
The process of chitin degradation is easier to target than degra-
dation of many other polymers such as the structurally heteroge-
neous lignin and humic acids or even cellulose. This is because of
its simple structure and the existence of primer-systems targetingthe chitin modifying enzymes. Chitin degradation could there-
fore be explored as a general model for understanding microbial
degradation of biopolymers in the biosphere.
