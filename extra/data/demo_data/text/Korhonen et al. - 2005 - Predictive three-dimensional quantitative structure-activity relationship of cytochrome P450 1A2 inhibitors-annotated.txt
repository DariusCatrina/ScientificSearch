The purpose of this study was to determine the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibition
potencies of structurally diverse compounds to create a comprehensive three-dimensionalquantitative structure -activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model of CYP1A2 inhibitors and to
use this model to predict the inhibition potencies of an external set of compounds. Fifty-twocompounds including naphthalene, lactone and quinoline derivatives were assayed in a 96-well plate format for CYP1A2 inhibition activity using 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation asthe probe reaction. The IC
50values of the tested compounds varied from 2.3 Ã­M to over 40 000
Ã­M. On the basis of this data set, a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and GRID/
GOLPE models were created that yielded novel structural information about the interactionbetween inhibitory molecules and the CYP1A2 active site. The created CoMFA model was ableto accurately predict inhibitory potencies of several structurally unrelated compounds, includingselective inhibitors of other cytochrome P450 forms.
Introduction
Microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are a
family of heme proteins involved in the metabolism ofnumerous toxic and pharmacologically active com-pounds. In humans, the CYP1A2 enzyme is expressedat a high level only in the liver, where it constitutesapproximately 10% of the total cytochrome P450 con-tent. It is one of the enzymes responsible for theactivation of aromatic and heterocyclic amines andpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to reactive meta-bolites.
1,2Many pharmaceuticals, e.g., caffeine3and
theophylline4are selective substrates for CYP1A2, and
the enzyme is effectively inhibited by furafylline5and
fluvoxamine.6,7A complete list of CYP1A2 substrates
and inhibitors is provided at the Web site http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart.
Rapid advances in several different technologies have
yielded increasingly precise information on the interac-tions between cytochrome P450 and their ligands. Inparticular, quantitative structure -activity relationship
(QSAR) and pharmacophore approaches have been usedto assess the active sites of cytochrome P450. These newcomputational models are promising tools to screenmore rapidly the quantitative interactions betweenchemicals and cytochrome P450 enzymes. However,these techniques are still in the early stages of develop-ment with respect to application for cytochrome P450and there is plenty of scope for technological improve-ment.
8
Several computational approaches, especially QSARs,
have been used to characterize the molecular propertiesof substrates and inhibitors of the CYP1A2 enzyme. Theoverall result of these studies is that substrates of
CYP1A2 are moderately basic and planar moleculeswith medium volume and low total interaction energies(Â¢Evalue), but there is no clear correlation between
compound lipophilicity and inhibitory effect.
9-15
There are no reports on the use of pharmacophore or
QSAR techniques to characterize the molecular proper-ties of CYP1A2 inhibitors and then to use this informa-tion for quantitative prediction. Therefore, the goals ofthis study were to determine the CYP1A2 inhibitionpotencies of structurally diverse compounds, to createa comprehensive 3D-QSAR model of CYP1A2 inhibitors,and to use this model to predict the inhibition potenciesof an external set of compounds. To achieve this goal,the abilities of 52 compounds including naphthalene,lactone, and quinoline derivatives to inhibit CYP1A2-catalyzed 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation reactionwere examined. On the basis of this data set, a com-parative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and a GRID/GOLPE analysis were carried out. The generated CoM-FA model yielded precise information about the molecularcharacteristics of CYP1A2 inhibitors and was able toaccurately predict the inhibitory potencies of severalstructurally unrelated compounds.

reaction. Recombinant human CYP1A2 was used as the
enzyme source to exclude any interference from othercytochrome P450 forms present in human liver mi-crosomes. The enzymatic activity was assayed underconstant conditions using seven different concentrationsof each inhibitor. Figure 3 represents an example ofconcentration-dependent inhibition of the enzyme activ-ity by two structurally different compounds (2,6-dim-ethylquinoline and 2-methylnaphthalene).
The lowest IC
50values were obtained with 1,4-
dichloronaphthalene and 2,4-dimethylquinoline ( <3
Ã­M), and the highest values were obtained with -ca-
prolactone and 4-methoxyfuran-2(5 H)-one ( >40 mM)
(Tables 1 and 2). Most of the naphthalene derivativeswere more potent inhibitors than the lactones and othercompounds tested.
The IC
50values of all naphthalene derivatives were
lower than the IC 50value of naphthalene because
methyl, chloro, ethyl, fluoro, and hydroxyl substitutionsdecreased the IC
50value. In general, disubstituted
naphthalenes or quinolines were more potent thanmonosubstituted or unsubstituted ones. In particular,electronegative substitutions at position 1 of naphtha-lene increased the inhibitory potency. The IC
50values
of quinoline derivatives were lower than the corre-sponding naphthalene derivatives, indicating that aheterocyclic nitrogen atom decreases the IC
50value
(Table 1).
The inhibitory potencies of 11 lactones were tested
(Table 2). The simple lactone ring structures were weakinhibitors, -caprolactone being the least potent. With
alkyl-substituted Ã§- and Ã¤-lactones, the inhibition po-
tency increased with increasing side chain length. Theoptimum length of the side chain was seven carbons.
The IC
50value decreased more than 300-fold when the
side chain length increased from methyl to hexyl in fivering lactones. The most potent lactone inhibitor wasundecanoic- Ã§-lactone (IC
50)45Ã­M).
In addition to lactone and naphthalene derivatives,
other selected compounds were tested for CYP1A2inhibition (Table 2). When the cyclohexane ring ofbutylcyclohexane was replaced by phenyl, the IC
50value
increased about 60-fold. 2-Coumarone and 2-indanone,which have a carbonyl group, were more potent inhibi-tors than indan and 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. A halogengroup at position 4 of the biphenyl increased inhibitorypotency, and that at position 2 decreased inhibitorypotency.
CoMFA and GRID/GOLPE Analysis. Forty-six
compounds listed in Tables 1 and 2 were analyzed usingCoMFA and GRID/GOLPE methods. Also listed in

Tables 1 and 2 are six compounds used in the external
test set. After data pretreatment, GRID/GOLPE analy-sis gave an r
2value of 0.86, followed by a q2value of
0.73 with three components and an SDEP of 0.60. Inthe final model, the smart region definition (SRD)method with F.Factorial Selection was used to removevariables that did not correlate with the inhibitionpotency. The obtained statistics of the models aresummarized in Table 3, and the plots for the training
set of both models are shown in Figure 4.
The CYP1A2 CoMFA model is represented as 3D
contour maps with 2,7-dimethylquinoline as the refer-ence structure (Figure 5). The contours of the steric mapare shown as green and yellow regions in which bulkygroups enhance and decrease inhibition potency, re-spectively. Those of the electrostatic map are shown asred and blue areas in which a more negative chargeenhances and decreases inhibition potency, respectively.Negative-charge-favored areas that were near a nitro-gen atom and positions 6 and 8 of the quinoline ringindicate that a partial negative charge here tended toincrease the inhibition potency. The broad negative-charge-disfavored area shown in blue was displayednear position 3 of the ring. The sterically favored greenarea was located around substitution at position 7 ofquinoline in the CoMFA model.
A stereofigure of the GOLPE coefficient map (Figure
6) displays large continuous regions, where the interac-tion with the hydroxyl probe is favorable (cyan) orunfavorable (purple). The favorable region is aroundthe nitrogen atom and partly above and under thearomatic ring structure. These regions of the inhibitorcan act as hydrogen bond acceptors or donors. Theelectronic configuration of the OH probe is defined sothat it interacts with the Ã°-electron of the conjugated
system like a planar aromatic ring or double bond. Itmakes strong hydrogen-bonding interactions, whichmay account for the shape of the interaction regionswith the molecular structures.
16The unfavorable re-
gions reside in the plane of the ring and are spread allaround the ring except to the region near the nitrogenatom.
The prediction power of the CoMFA model was
evaluated by estimating pIC
50values for an external test
set of compounds, including the six compounds testedin this study (Tables 1 and 2). These six compoundswere chosen on the basis that they resemble in structurethe ones in the training set but also contain featuresthat differ from the training set compounds.

Discussion
The main purpose of this study was to create a QSAR
model to understand in greater detail the structuralproperties of inhibitors of the human CYP1A2 enzyme.The inhibition potency of a series of 52 chemicals wasdetermined against the CYP1A2 enzyme. With this dataset, CoMFA and GRID/GOLPE models were createdthat yielded novel structural information about theinteraction between inhibitory molecules and theCYP1A2 active site. In addition, the developed CYP1A2CoMFA model accurately predicted the inhibition po-tencies of several structurally unrelated compounds.
Some disubstituted naphthalene and quinoline de-
rivatives were found to be potent inhibitors of CYP1A2.Quinoline derivatives had lower IC
50values than the
corresponding naphthalene derivatives, indicating thata heterocyclic nitrogen atom increases inhibition po-tency. Also, hydrophobic substituents at position 1 ofthe naphthalene ring increase inhibition potency. Hy-droxyl, halogen, and methyl substitutions of the naph-thalene ring decreased the IC
50values. The IC 50values
of molecules decreased as the molecular volume oflactones and the length of alkyl side chain increased.
Previously published QSAR studies on the CYP1A2
enzyme were based on a limited number of structurallydiverse compounds and have not been used to predictthe inhibition potency of new compounds. One of thefirst human CYP1A2 3D-QSAR studies was carried outon quinolone antibacterials.
9Four pharmacophore fea-
tures were suggested to be involved in the binding ofquinolone-type CYP1A2 inhibitors in the active site. Nocorrelation between lipophilicity and the inhibitoryeffect could be observed in this study.
9On the basis of
the experimental finding that a methyl group at position8 of the xanthine ring is important for CYP1A2 inhibi-tion, a subsequent theoretical model was created usinga molecular electrostatic potential approach.
10A QSAR
analysis using inhibition data of 16 naturally occurringflavonoids showed that planar molecules with a smallvolume to surface area were the most potent inhibitors,the number of hydroxyl groups being inversely propor-tional to inhibition potency, and glycosylation of the freehydroxyls could reduce the inhibition potency.
11
Two different studies docked selected substrates into
the active site of homology models of the CYP1A2protein and analyzed the binding mode of the ligand -
enzyme complex in terms of molecular mechanics cal-culations.
12,13Lozano et al.13used the COMBINE method
for energy partition and adjacent 3D-QSAR analysis.Subsequently they performed a GRID/GOLPE analysis
using the phenylic OH group. The combination of bothmethods provided useful insights into the positions oflikely hydrogen bonding or placement of hydrophobicor bulky groups. A previous study suggested thatCYP1A2 substrates are generally neutral or protonatedmolecules.
14
The correlation between electrostatic interactions and
pIC 50values appeared in the CoMFA maps as negative-
charge-favored areas that are near the nitrogen atomof the quinoline ring. Also, electronegative substituentsat position 1 of the naphthalene ring are important forinhibition. This explains the finding that 1,4-dichlo-ronaphthalene and 1-naphthol are quite potent inhibi-tors compared with the naphthalenes with halogen orother electronegative substituent at position 2. In ad-dition, there is an attractive interaction between thehydroxyl probe and an inhibitor favorable area locatedaround position 1 of the quinoline ring near the nitrogenatom. The hydroxyl probe is capable of donating andaccepting one hydrogen bond with a hydrogen acceptoror donor atom or with the Ã°-system of the aromatic ring.
GRID/GOLPE maps can describe interactions betweennitrogen and the hydroxyl group or dipole-induceddipole interactions between the aromatic ring and theprobe.
16The nitrogen atom can act as a hydrogen-
bonding acceptor atom, which indicates that hydrogenbonding is an important interaction between quinoline-type inhibitors and the CYP1A2 enzyme.
Most of the CYP1A2 substrates are hydrophobic with
high log Pvalues, suggesting that hydrophobic interac-
tions play an important role in binding to CYP1A2. Thecreated CoMFA model confirms this because the CoMFAmodel shows that alkyl substitutions at position 7increase the inhibitory potency. The alkyl side chain oflactones can interact with hydrophobic amino acids inthe CYP1A2 protein. A large steric-favored region islocated near the 7-position in the CoMFA map. Also,substitution of naphthalene with hydrophobic substit-uents such as halogen or methyl groups increases theinhibition potency. These data suggest that the bindingpocket of the CYP1A2 enzyme is composed of mostlyhydrophobic and aromatic amino acids, with polaramino acids for hydrogen bonding being present nearthe heme center.
18In addition to the use of steric and
electrostatic fields, a CoMFA model was created usinglogPvalues as an additional variable. This did not
improve in the model.
The created CoMFA model predicted very well the
inhibitory potencies of the test set of compounds. Thebest predictions were obtained for biphenyls and 1,5-dichloronaphthalene, with predicted pIC
50values being
within 0.05 log units of the actual values. The modelalso predicted well the CYP1A2 pIC
50values of several
well-known inhibitors of other cytochrome P450 forms,ketoconazole (CYP3A4), tranylcypromine (CYP2A6),quinidine (CYP2D6), quercetin (CYP2C8), and sul-faphenazole (CYP2C9).
7This is remarkable because the
structures of these compounds differ considerably fromthe ones used in the training set.
The current CoMFA model takes into account both
steric and electrostatic interactions. The CoMFA ap-proach described in this report represents a robustmethod to screen for inhibitory properties of compoundsTable 4. Validation of CYP1A2 Model

toward CYP1A2. A similar approach will be applicable
to other xenobiotic metabolizing cytochrome P450 com-pounds as well. We have shown earlier that CoMFAmodeling can predict reasonably well the actual inhibi-tion characteristics of lactones and naphthalenes towardthe human CYP2A6 and mouse CYP2A5 enzymes andthat naphthalene is metabolized by these CYP forms.
19,20
A CoMFA method similar to the one described here hasbeen used for modeling the CYP2A6 enzyme.
21In the
present CYP1A2 QSAR study, the GRID/GOLPE analy-sis was also applied, which improved the precision ofthe model through exclusion of variables that were notsignificant.
The model presented here is clearly superior to
previously published QSAR models of CYP1A2. Thecurrent training set is large and contains structurallydiverse compounds. All biological data used in thetraining set are generated with internally fully consis-tent methods. The model is reasonably predictive evenfor compounds that differ in structure from the ones inthe training set. Using the hydroxyl probe yieldedinformation about the importance of dipole-induceddipole interaction in the active site of CYP1A2. TheGRID/GOLPE analysis gave insight into the shape ofthe interaction regions. The presented CoMFA andGRID/GOLPE models are in agreement with previousstudies concerning areas of H-bonds and electrostaticfield.
9-13However, from the statistical analysis of a
large training set with structurally diverse compounds,the present model is more general and predictive thanthe previous ones. In particular, the spatial orientationin the regions where H-bonds are likely to occur andthe regions where bulky groups enhance the inhibitorypotential could be determined in both a qualitative anda quantitative way.
There are two major reasons for studying inhibitory
potencies of drug candidates and other xenobiotics.First, potent inhibition by a drug candidate gives anearly warning about potential drug -drug interactions
during its clinical use. Second, evidence of inhibitioncapabilities suggests that the compound may be asubstrate for the cytochrome P450 studied. This appliesespecially to competitive inhibitors. Because competitiveinhibitors are usually also substrates of cytochrome
P450, screening of inhibitory properties serves as a goodstarting point for substrate specificity studies for anychemical compound. Inhibitor orientation in the CoMFAmodel provides clues on how it is coordinated towardthe cytochrome P450 heme iron if the oxidation patternof at least one molecule in the training set is known.Thus, a CoMFA model based on inhibition data canrepresent a starting point to the much more complextask of predicting the metabolism of novel compounds.
A recent report has described a computational filter
for prediction of inhibitory properties of compoundstoward CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes. The filter, basedon training sets of more than 1700 molecules, yielded astatistically significant rank ordering of test set mol-ecules.
22There is now considerable interest in the
development of computational methods to assess cyto-chrome P450 mediated metabolic properties of drugcandidates and other xenobiotics. Initial attempts arebeing made to create databases combining differentapproaches for the prediction of metabolism.
23In the future these kinds of computer models may
become very efficient for predicting the structuralrequirements of inhibitors of cytochrome P450. Inparticular, the combination of QSAR and protein modelsoffers a potentially very powerful approach for predict-ing cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism.

tors were dissolved in ethanol, and the final concentration ofethanol was 2% in all incubations. The reaction was initiatedby adding the NADPH-regenerating system after a 10 minpreincubation at 37Â°C, and after a 20 min incubation, thereaction was terminated by the addition of 110 Ã­Lo f8 0 %
acetonitrile/20% 0.5 M Tris base. The formed fluorescence wasmeasured with a Victor
2plate counter (Perkin-Elmer Life
Sciences Wallac, Turku, Finland) at 570 nm excitation and616 nm emission. The linearity of the reaction with respect toincubation time and protein concentration was determined.Several control incubations were carried out to determine theeffect of quenching by the inhibitors and other interferingfactors. Each inhibitor was prescreened using pooled humanliver microsomes at inhibitor concentrations ranging from 0.1to 40 000 Ã­M. The actual IC
50values were determined using
expressed human CYP1A2 enzyme and seven inhibitor con-centrations. The IC
50values were calculated using nonlinearQSAR of CYP1A2 Inhibitors Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, Vol. 48, No. 11 3813

regression analysis with Prism 4.0 software (San Diego, CA)
from the results of two separate experiments.
Because the purpose of this study was to create a model for
CYP1A2 enzyme inhibition, IC 50values (measuring relative
inhibition potency) rather than the absolute Kivalues were
determined. This is justified because all measurements weremade under standardized conditions, and the results are thusfully comparable with each other.
CoMFA and GRID/GOLPE Models. The construction of
the molecules, superimposition, and CoMFA modeling wereperformed using the Sybyl 6.9 (Tripos Associates Inc., St.Louis, MO) molecular modeling software. The biological datawas transformed to pIC
50(-log IC 50) values.
Atomic point charges were calculated using the MMFF94
method. Standard CoMFA analysis included steric and elec-trostatic fields that were calculated using the sp
3carbon probe
atom with a +1 charge an da2Ã… grid spacing. The standard
derivation threshold for exclusion of columns from the partialleast squares (PLS) analysis was set at 2 kcal/mol. The PLSmethod with five random group cross-validations was used forstatistical analyses, and this calculation was repeated 20 timesto verify the stability of the obtained q
2values. The optimum
number of components for the nonvalidated analyses waschosen using the lowest S
PRESS value and the highest q2value.
The predictive capacity of the generated model was testedusing an external set of compounds (Table 6).
In addition to the standard CoMFA model, another model
was created using the GRID/GOLPE method. GRID fields werecreated using a phenolic hydroxyl probe wit h 1 Ã… grid spacing,
and the positive cutoff was set to 5 kcal/mol. The phenolichydroxyl probe was chosen because it represents a hydrogenbond donor or acceptor that was found to be suitable forexamining aromatic systems. GRID fields of the moleculeswere analyzed with GOLPE.

Initially the GRID/GOLPE analysis included several vari-
ables that did not describe interactions between inhibitorymolecules and the GOLPE hydroxyl probes. Therefore, theSRD and the F.Factorial Selection procedures were used toreduce the number of variables in the final GOLPE model.Data pretreatment was done using the zeroing option correc-tion. To diminish the amount of noise in the data, positivevalues smaller than 0.10 and negative values greater than-0.01 were zeroed. The SRD analysis was performed to select
important variables for the interaction using a maximumdimensionality of 5 with a critical distance cutoff value of 1 Ã…and with a collapsing distance cutoff value of 2 Ã…. TheF.Factorial Selection procedure was used with a maximumdimensionality of 2, and the Random Groups method was usedwith five groups to separate a variable that significantlyimproves predictability. The final model was validated byusing PLS cross-validation with five random groups.
