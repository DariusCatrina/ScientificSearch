vProtein-carbohydrate interactions are involved in diverse processes required for life, includ -
ing the microbial degradation of plant biomass and marine polysaccharides and human 
health and nutrition. Understanding and predicting how carbohydrates are recognized and 
modified by carbohydrate-active enzymes (i.e., CAZymes) therefore is an important area of 
basic research that spans multiple disciplines and holds vast promise for informing future 
innovations in renewable resource utilization and medicine. Since the turn of the millennia, 
the field of protein-carbohydrate interactions has been transformed by high-throughput 
and ultrasensitive instrumentation, which has enabled us to study complex carbohydrate 
utilization systems at the levels of metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, and metaproteomes. 
This increase in technology has opened new doors for CAZyme discovery and application. 
Here within we will provide a wide-ranging resource for studying protein-carbohydrate 
interactions that extends from traditional biochemical methods to state-of-the-art tech -
niques, both of which will continue to propel the field forward in the coming years. In 
particular, this volume will focus on four different research themes.
Part I describes methods for screening and quantifying CAZyme activity. These chap -
ters will survey each class of CAZyme, including glycoside hydrolases (Chap. 1, Copper-  
Bicinchoninic Acid; Chap. 2, High-Performance Anion-Exchange Chromatography; and 
Chap. 3, 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic Acid Assays), polysaccharide lyases (Chap. 4), carbohydrate 
esterases (Chap. 5), glycosyltransferases (Chap. 6), and lytic polysaccharide monooxygen -
ases (Chap. 7). In addition, a method for investigating carbohydrate depolymerization by 
cellulosomes, which can contain multiple enzyme classes and activities (Chap. 8), is 
provided.
Part II contains methods for investigating the interactions between proteins and carbo -
hydrate ligands. These techniques include affinity gel electrophoresis of catalytic modules 
(Chap. 9), microscale thermophoresis (Chap. 10), and NMR spectroscopy (Chap. 11). 
The final chapter in this section describes current methods for detecting the biomechanical 
activity of expansions (Chap. 12), a class of proteins involved in the loosening of plant cell 
wall networks.
Part III discusses methods for the visualization of carbohydrates and protein-  
carbohydrate complexes. These chapters include a novel bioinspired plant cell wall assembly 
for measuring protein interactions by fluorescence (Chap. 13), using carbohydrate-binding 
modules as probes within plant cell walls (Chap. 14), and investigating the subcellular local -
ization of CAZymes within Gram-negative bacteria (Chap. 15). These are followed by 
three different methods for investigating carbohydrate structure. First is a method for using 
Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy to characterize the composition of plant cell 
walls (Chap. 16); this is followed by methods for studying fluorescent glycans by electro -
phoresis (Chap. 17) and capillary electrophoresis (Chap. 18).
Finally, Part IV focuses on structural and “omics” approaches for studying systems of 
CAZymes. First, a “dissect and build” approach for determining multimodular CAZyme 
structure involving combinatorial small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray crystallography is 
described (Chap. 19) followed by methods describing the development of “omics” tech -Preface 
vi
niques to identifying novel CAZyme systems using metagenomics (Chap. 20), transcriptomics 
(Chap. 21), and proteomics (Chapter 22) approaches.
We anticipate that this collection of methods for studying carbohydrate modification 
and protein-carbohydrate interactions will be a valuable resource to the glycomics research 
community. As the field continues to advance, methods included within this volume will 
have utility for illuminating the biology of glycomics, driving biotechnological innovation, 
and developing solutions for human health and for sustainable resources within the emerg -
ing green economy.

A Low-Volume, Parallel Copper-Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) 
Assay for  Glycoside Hydrolases
Gregory  Arnal, Mohamed  A. Attia, Jathavan  Asohan, and  Harry  Brumer
Abstract
The quantitation of liberated reducing sugars by the copper-bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay provides a 
highly sensitive method for the measurement of glycoside hydrolase (GH) activity, particularly on soluble 
polysaccharide substrates. Here, we describe a straightforward method adapted to low-volume polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) tubes which enables the rapid, parallel determination of GH kinetics in applications 
ranging from initial activity screening and assay optimization, to precise Michaelis–Menten analysis.
Key words Glycoside hydrolase (GH), Glycosidase, Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), 
Copper-bicinchoninic acid (BCA), Polysaccharide, Enzymology, Reducing sugar
1 Introduction
The cleavage of a glycosidic bond in an oligo- or polysaccharide by 
a glycoside hydrolase (glycosidase, EC 3.2.1) results in the genera -
tion of a new hemiacetal chain end, the aldehyde form of which 
can be oxidized with the concomitant reduction of metal ions to 
lower oxidation states. This reaction is the basis for the classic 
silver-  based Tollen’s and copper-based Fehling’s qualitative tests 
for “reducing sugars” [ 1]. In particular, these free “reducing ends” 
readily convert cupric (Cu2+) to cuprous (Cu1+) ions, the latter of 
which can be bis-chelated by disodium 2,2 ′-bicinchoninic acid 
(BCA) to yield a stable, intense purple complex ( λmax 562 nm). The 
formation of the Cu1+-BCA complex was first used for carbohy -
drate detection following chromatography [ 2], an application that 
in fact predates its widespread use for protein quantitation [ 3]. 
Subsequent development of the copper-BCA assay for carbohy -
drates included quantitative analysis of reducing monosaccharides 
and oligosaccharides with up to nanomole sensitivity [ 4–7], appli -
cation to glycoside hydrolase (GH) activity assays [ 8], and minia -
turization in a micro-well plate format [ 9–11]. In these applications, 
the unique accuracy and sensitivity of the BCA assay vis-à-vis  other 
4
reducing-end methods (e.g., Nelson-Somogyi, dinitrosalicylate) 
has been underscored [ 7, 8].
In this chapter, we describe the further adaptation of a minia -
turized, parallel BCA glycoside hydrolase assay to standard poly -
merase chain reaction (PCR) tubes. This enables the use of widely 
available PCR thermocyclers/thermoblocks for temperature con -
trol for both enzymatic reactions and color development steps. 
Additionally, the use of capped PCR tubes in strip format facilitates 
sample handling. Furthermore, the intrinsic tight seal of PCR 
tubes (which are designed for high-temperature use), together 
with heated thermocycler/thermoblock lids, significantly mini -
mizes errors due to sample evaporation from small volumes, 
thereby improving assay precision. This method is directly appli -
cable for most standard biochemistry and molecular biology labo -
ratories, and does not inherently require advanced robotics for 
implementation.
2 Materials
All solutions should be prepared using ultrapure water with a resis -
tivity of 18  MΩ-cm at 25  °C.
 1. Analytical balance.
 2. Magnetic stirrer and stir bars.
 3. 100 mL graduated cylinder.
 4. Solution A (54.28  g/L Na 2CO 3, 24.20  g/L NaHCO 3, and 
1.94 g/L disodium 2,2 ′-bicinchoninic acid). Weigh 2.714  g 
(25.6  mmol) of Na 2CO 3, 1.210  g (14.4  mmol) of NaHCO 3, 
and 0.097  g (0.25  mmol) of bicinchoninic acid disodium salt 
hydrate. Dissolve by stirring in ca. 25  mL of ultrapure water in 
a graduated cylinder and dilute to a final volume of 50  mL. This 
solution is stable for 1 month when stored at room tempera -
ture in the dark.
 5. Solution B (1.25  g/L CuSO 4:5H 2O, 1.26  g/L l-serine). 
Weigh 0.062  g (0.25  mmol) of CuSO 4:5H 2O and 0.063  g 
(0.60  mmol) of l-Serine. Dissolve by stirring in ca. 25  mL of 
ultrapure water in a graduated cylinder and dilute to a final 
volume of 50  mL. This solution is stable for 1 month when 
stored at 4  °C in the dark.
 6. The BCA working reagent is prepared daily by mixing equal 
volumes of Solution A and Solution B (1:1 ratio), which results 
in a light blue solution.

 4. 1.7 mL plastic microcentrifuge tubes.
 5. 15 mL plastic centrifuge tube.
 6. In a 15  mL conical tube, prepare a fresh 10  mM d-glucose 
solution by weighing 18.01  mg of d-glucose and dissolving in 
10 mL of ultrapure water ( see Note 1 ).
 7. Prepare carbohydrate substrate stock solutions at 5  mg/mL, 
or the highest practical concentration, by dissolving in ultra -
pure water in a beaker or flask ( see Notes 2  and 3).
 1. Prepare all buffers according to standard protocols [ 12] at ten 
times (10×) the final concentration desired in the assay.
 2. Enzyme stock solutions and suitable dilutions should be pre -
pared following best practices for protein handling [ 13].
 1. Strips of eight thin-walled PCR tubes (200  μL volume).
 2. Two multichannel reagent reservoirs ( see Note 4 ).
 3. 1–10, 10–100, and 100–1000  μL micropipettes and dispos -
able plastic tips.
 4. 1–10 and 10–300  μL multichannel pipettes.
 5. PCR thermocycler or thermoblock for PCR tubes, capable of 
accurately maintaining a wide range of temperatures 
(4–100  °C). An Eppendorf Thermomixer C equipped with the 
ThermoTop is especially recommended; PCR tubes are com -
pletely encompassed by the corresponding block, which guar -
antees a homogeneous temperature distribution in 200  μL 
reactions, while the heated ThermoTop efficiently prevents 
assay solution condensation on tube lids.
 6. Benchtop centrifuge equipped with a PCR tube rotor.
 7. Flat-bottom polystyrene microplate suitable for absorbance 
measurements.
 8. Microplate reader suitable for A562 measurements.
3 Methods
Figure 1 provides a schematic overview of an assay designed for a 
thermocycler/thermoblock with a 6  × 8 heating block, which 
includes enzyme assays in triplicate, blank assays in duplicate, and one 
series of reducing-sugar standards. The number of replicates of each 
may be expanded depending upon available thermal equipment. 
Optimization of enzyme assays to generate accurate, publication-  
quality data is necessarily an iterative procedure involving determina -

Fig. 1  Assay scheme. A 6  × 8 tube layout is shown that corresponds to common PCR thermocycler/thermob -
lock format, in which up to eight different conditions can be tested in parallel. A solution of substrate in the 
assay buffer and the BCA working reagent are distributed into multichannel reservoirs; enzyme in buffer and 
the corresponding buffer blanks are distributed into 8-PCR tube strips. These different solutions are subse -
quently distributed using multichannel pipettes in the following steps. Step 1 : Substrate (columns E1, E2, E3, 
B1, B2) and carbohydrate standard (column S) solutions in the assay buffer are distributed and equilibrated at 
the assay temperature in a PCR thermocycler/thermoblock. Step 2 : Assays are initiated by adding the enzyme 
solutions to the tubes in columns E1, E2, and E3; blank (buffer only) solutions are added to the columns B1 and 
B2. Step 3 : Reactions are stopped by the addition of BCA working reagent and placement on ice, prior to read -
justing the block temperature to 80  °C for color developmentGregory Arnal et al.

 1. Dilute the carbohydrate standard stock solution (10  mM) by a 
factor of 10 by adding 9  mL of ultrapure water 1 mL of stock 
solution to, resulting in a 1  mM carbohydrate solution.
 2. Dilute the 1  mM carbohydrate standard solution in the assay 
buffer as indicated in Table 1 to obtain 8 different glucose 
solutions at different concentrations (0–125  μM) ( see Note 6 ).
 3. In an 8-PCR-tube-strip (Fig. 1, “S”), distribute 100  μL of 
each solution into individual tubes.
 4. Keep the standards on ice until use.
Fig. 2  Examples of various glycoside hydrolase (GH) operational assays that can be performed using the 
method described here, with the fixed and varied parameters indicated for each. Kinetic analysis of previously 
uncharacterised enzymes will involve iteration of these assays to determine optimal assay parameters. 
Typically, GH characterization begins with substrate screening to determine enzyme specificity. Consequently, 
enzyme concentration is scouted to assure that the reaction is linear over a convenient assay time (e.g., 
10–30  min), and that the amount of reducing ends released falls within the standard curve (0–125  μM). 
Optimal pH and temperature can then be determined using a suitable enzyme concentration (e.g., one that 
gives A 562 of ca. 0.8). Finally, Michaelis–Menten analysis can be performed by varying substrate concentration 
(e.g., 0.1  KM to 10  KM), taking special care to ensure that assay linearity is maintained at the lowest substrate 
concentration [ 14]Determining Glycoside Hydrolase Kinetics Using the Copper-Bicinchoninic Acid Assay

Solutions of substrate(s) in buffer(s) can vary depending on the 
type of assay (Fig. 2), and this determines the composition of the 
tubes in Rows 1–8 (Fig. 1).
 1. Mix 60  μL of 10× buffer, 120  μL of 5× polysaccharide ( see 
Note 7 ), and 360  μL of ultrapure water in Row 1 of the mul -
tichannel reagent reservoir ( see Note 4 ). This 540  μL total 
volume is sufficient for 6 assays (3 enzyme assay replicates and 
2 blanks, with additional volume to allow accurate pipetting).
 2. Repeat the step above for the remaining wells of the multi -
channel reservoir to set the conditions of the seven other 
assays, varying maximally one solution parameter (Fig. 2, e.g. 
substrate or buffer concentration, or type).
The preparation of enzyme and blank solutions can vary depend -
ing on the type of assay (Fig. 2).
 1. Prepare a working enzyme solution in Row 1 of the “Enzyme” 
PCR-tube strip (Fig. 1) by dilution of the enzyme stock solu -
tion in 1× assay buffer (e.g., 50  mM) containing 0.1  mg/mL 
of BSA ( see Note 8 ) to a final volume of at least 40  μL (suffi -
cient volume for three replicates plus additional volume to 
allow accurate pipetting). This working enzyme solution will 
be further diluted an additional factor of 10  in the final assay 
solution (vide infra).
 2. Repeat the step above for the remainder of the tubes in 
“Enzyme” strip, unless performing an enzyme concentration 
scouting experiment by serial dilution (Fig. 2).
 3. Prepare the blanks in a PCR-tube strip ( see Fig. 1, “Blank”) by 
filling each tube with at least 30  μL of 1× assay buffer (e.g., 
50 mM) containing 0.1  mg/mL of BSA ( see Note 9 ).3.4 Preparation

 1. In a thermocycler/thermoblock, organize five empty strips of 
eight PCR tubes (corresponding to columns E1, E2, E3, B1, 
and B2 as indicated in Fig. 1) and include the strip of standard 
solutions “S” that was prepared in Subheading 3.3.
 2. Using a multichannel pipette, transfer 90  μL of the substrate in 
buffer solution(s) into Strips E1, E2, E3, B1, and B2.
 3. Equilibrate the reaction mixtures at the set assay temperature 
in the thermocycler/thermoblock for 10  min.
 4. Ca. 20  s before starting the reaction, open the thermocycler/
thermoblock lid and carefully  open the E1 PCR tube lids.
 5. Start the reactions in E1 by adding 10  μL of the enzyme 
solution(s) from the “Enzyme” PCR-tube strip (Fig. 1) using 
a multichannel pipette. Mix thoroughly by reciprocal pipetting 
(three times; be consistent in mixing method and time). Close 
the lids of PCR tubes and thermocycler/thermoblock.
 6. Maintaining a strict 1-min time interval between enzyme addi -
tions, repeat step 5  for Strips E2 and E3.
 7. Again maintaining a strict 1-min time interval between addi -
tions, add the “Blank” solution from the corresponding PCR-  
tube strip (Fig. 1) to Strips B1 and B2.
 8. Ca. 20  s before the end of the desired assay duration (e.g., 
10 min since the addition of enzyme to Strip E1; see Note 10 ) 
prepare to stop the reactions in Strip E1 by opening the ther -
mocycler/thermoblock lid and the PCR tube lids (carefully).
 9. Precisely at the end of the assay duration, stop the reactions in 
Strip E1 by adding 100  μL of BCA reagent with a multichan -
nel pipette and mix by reciprocal pipetting 2 times (be consis -
tent in time). Place the reactions on ice to prevent immediate 
color development ( see Note 11 ). Close the lid of the thermo -
cycler/thermoblock.
 10. Maintaining strict 1-min time intervals, repeat step 9  for Strips

 1. Subtract the A562 value of the blank (0  μM carbohydrate) from 
all the A562 values of the carbohydrate standard solutions.
 2. Plot the background-corrected absorbance values versus car -

 3. Use linear regression to obtain the best fit line through all 
points. The intercept of the best-fit line should be zero (or 
negligible) and hence the slope ( mstd) will be used to directly 
determine the concentrations of reducing ends generated in 
the enzyme assays (vide infra) (Fig. 3a).
 1. Calculate the average A562 values of the enzyme replicates in 
Strips E1, E2, and E3; A562(enzyme) .
 2. Calculate the average A562 values of the blanks in both series, 
Strips B1 and B2; A562(blank) .
 3. Subtract the averaged enzyme and blank A562 values and divide 
by the slope of carbohydrate standard curve ( see Subheading 
3.8.1 , step 3 ) to obtain the concentration of reducing ends in 
each assay in μM (see Note 13 ).

4 Notes
 1. Glucose has been widely used in establishing copper-BCA 
standard curves, regardless of the polysaccharide tested, due to 
its low cost and wide general availability. Several studies have 
demonstrated that different monosaccharides and oligosaccha -
rides exhibit minor [ 8, 16] or major [ 5, 7, 11] deviations from 
the response observed for glucose, which should be considered 
when establishing the standard curve for a particular enzyme 
assay. Glucose standard curves are linear up to 125  μM in a 
wide range of buffers that we have tested in our lab.
 2. Solubilization of high molecular mass polysaccharides can be 
challenging, often requiring portion-wise addition, heating, 
and vigorous stirring.
 3. Low molecular weight polysaccharides or oligosaccharides may 
exhibit unacceptably high background levels in the assay, due 
to intrinsic reducing ends. Reduction of saccharides to alditols 
with sodium borohydride [ 17] can be used to resolve this 
problem.
 4. Can be substituted by 1.7  mL microfuge tubes.
 5. Temperature gradient thermocyclers/thermoblocks can be 
effectively used for temperature-activity profile analysis (cf. 
Fig. 2).
 6. Large-volume, single-step dilutions are used to minimize sys -
tematic and accumulated pipetting errors. Weighing solutions 
on an analytical balance can further improve dilution accuracy 
and reduce assay error.
 7. For screening and assay optimization, polysaccharide concen -
trations of 0.5–1.0  mg/mL (or higher) typically ensure that 
less than 1% of the substrate is hydrolyzed at absorbance values 
falling within the linear range of the standard curve. As such, 
enzyme assays typically may be assumed to be linear with 
respect to time and thus under initial-rate conditions.
 8. Addition of BSA limits nonspecific protein adsorption onto 
plastic surfaces and thus loss of activity. Although proteins can 
react with the copper-BCA reagent [ 3], thus potentially inter -
fering with reducing-sugar quantitation, the BSA concentra -
tion in the final assay provides a negligible contribution to Gregory Arnal et al.
13
color development, which is nonetheless compensated by the 
blank solutions.
 9. Although proteins can react with the copper-BCA reagent [ 3], 
thus potentially interfering with reducing-sugar quantitation, 
typical concentrations of purified enzymes in the assay (<2  μg/
mL) do not significantly contribute to A562. However, when 
using crude enzyme preparations or other cases involving high 
enzyme (protein) concentration, the “Blank” PCR-tube strip 
should be prepared to contain an inactivated enzyme control.
 10. It is recommended to use extended assays (1  h to overnight) 
when screening enzyme activity toward different substrates, to 
capture low-level activities.
 11. These solutions are stable on ice up to 1  h.
 12. The BCA assay is not a true end-point method; therefore, 
color continues to develop at 80  °C, but is greatly slowed at 
4 °C. It is important to respect incubation times and to use a 
series of standard solutions incubated in parallel with test assays 
to obtain reliable and reproducible results.
 13. It is necessary to calculate propagation of error (standard devi -
ation or standard error) for this and for all further calculations, 
see [18].
 14. The ExPASy ProtParam tool [ 19] can be used to accurately 
determine the molar mass of enzymes of known amino acid 
sequence: http://web.expasy.org/protparam/ .
 15. If the data does not appear to outline the classic rectangular 
hyperbola described by the Michaelis–Menten equation, the 
analysis should be repeated by increasing or decreasing the 
range of substrate concentrations as appropriate to bracket the 
apparent KM value from ca. 0.1  KM to 10  KM [14]. If satura -
tion of the enzyme with substrate cannot be achieved, the ratio 
of kcat/KM can be obtained from the slope of a linear fit to the 
data at [S]  < KM.

Quantitative Kinetic Characterization of  Glycoside 
Hydrolases Using High-Performance Anion-Exchange 
Chromatography (HPAEC)
Nicholas  McGregor, Gregory  Arnal, and  Harry  Brumer
Abstract
High-performance anion-exchange chromatography coupled to pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-  
PAD) is a powerful analytical technique enabling the high-resolution separation and sensitive quantifica -
tion of oligosaccharides. Here, we describe a general method for the determination of glycoside hydrolase 
kinetics that harnesses the intrinsic power of HPAEC-PAD to simultaneously monitor the release of mul -
tiple products under conditions of low substrate conversion. Thus, the ability to track product release 
under initial-rate conditions with substrate concentrations as low as 5  μM enables the determination of 
Michaelis–Menten kinetics for glycosidase activities, including hydrolysis and transglycosylation. This tech -
nique may also be readily extended to other carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), including polysac -
charide lyases, and glycosyl transferases.

1 Introduction
The assembly and deconstruction of the great variety of complex 
carbohydrates found in nature is facilitated by a corresponding 
diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), which have 
been classified into hundreds of protein sequence-based families 
[1]. Of these, the glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and polysaccharide 
lyases (PLs) mediate glycan breakdown to component monosaccha -
rides, and are therefore of broad fundamental and applied impor -
tance [ 2–5]. Detailed substrate-specificity, kinetics, and product 
analyses are central to CAZyme discovery and characterization, and 
moreover form the bedrock of advanced protein structure-  function 
analyses and refined bioinformatic predictions [ 6–9]. These data, in 
turn, underpin biocatalyst engineering and applications.
In harness with classical quantitative assays ( see the chapters by 
McKee (Chapter 3) and Arnal et  al. (Chapter 1) in this volume), 
16
high-performance anion exchange chromatography coupled to 
pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD, [ 10–12]) is a power -
ful tool for CAZyme functional analysis. HPAEC-PAD is widely used 
for CAZyme product characterization in end-point, or limit-  digest, 
analyses (e.g., see refs. 13–15 and references therein). Our group has 
subsequently adapted the sensitivity of HPAEC-PAD for initial-rate 
enzyme kinetic analysis of glycoside hydrolases and transglycosylases 
under conditions of low substrate conversion. Significantly, this tech -
nique allows the simultaneous quantitation of all enzyme products 
and determination of Michaelis–Menten kinetic parameters for native 
(non-derivatized) saccharides [ 13, 16–20]. We detail here a general 
method for the initial-rate analysis of glycosidases, which can be read -
ily adapted to a wide range of HPAEC-PAD chromatographic media.
2 Materials
All solutions must be prepared from ultrapure water having a resis -
tivity of 18  MΩ·cm at 25  °C and should be filtered using a suitable 
0.22 μm nominal pore size filter before use. All reagents should be 
obtained at analytical grade or other suitable high-purity grade. 
Prepare and store all reagents under ambient conditions unless oth -
erwise indicated. All waste should be appropriately collected and dis -
posed of according to local regulations. We recommend using 
dedicated glassware for eluent preparation to avoid contamination 
and maintain chromatographic reproducibility. As described below, 
oligosaccharide analyses were performed using a Dionex ICS-5000 
with a 4-channel gradient pump, AS-AP autosampler, and ED elec -
trochemical cell equipped with a 1  mm gold electrode and Ag/AgCl 
reference electrode ( see Note 1 ). Oligosaccharides were separated on 
a 3 × 250 mm CarboPac PA200 column with a 3  × 50 mm CarboPac 
PA200 guard column at a flow rate of 0.5  mL/min. Data acquisition 
and analysis was performed using Chromeleon 7 chromatography 
software. The methods below may be adapted to other comparable 
HPAEC-PAD systems, including various columns appropriate to 
specific mono- and oligosaccharides (reviewed in [ 12]).

82.03  g of anhydrous sodium acetate (BioUltra grade, Sigma

500 mL of water and mix to dissolve. Quantitatively transfer 
the solution to a 1  L volumetric flask, add water to 1  L and 
invert to mix. Vacuum-filter the solution and transfer to a 
clean and dry plastic HPLC reservoir bottle ( see Note 2 ).
 2. Eluent B, 1  M sodium hydroxide: To ca. 500  mL of water in 
a 1 L graduated cylinder or volumetric flask, add 52.8  mL of

 2. Thin-walled PCR tubes (200  μL volume).
 3. Two PCR thermocyclers or heat blocks with heated lids and 
200 μL PCR tube blocks.
 4. Enzyme stock solutions should be prepared in a suitable assay 
buffer [ 21], including any necessary additives or cofactors to 
maintain activity ( see Note 4 ), and handled using best prac -
tices [ 22]. Although the methods below assume that the opti -
mal conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, buffer, cofactors) are 
known through independent experiments, these may also be 
determined by HPAEC-PAD assay prior to kinetic 
characterization.
 5. Appropriate oligosaccharide substrates and products of known 
molecular composition should be dissolved in ultrapure water 
(or a suitable buffer solution of minimal concentration ( see 
Note 5 )). Stocks should in general be made at the highest 
practical carbohydrate concentration (e.g., 10  mM for oligo -
saccharides); volumes should be chosen to minimize errors 
due to weighing milligram amounts, in light of carbohydrate 
availability and cost.
3 Methods
The success of initial-rate kinetics using HPAEC-PAD is depen -
dent on efficient separation of all enzyme products at <  10 %  
(ideally, <  1 %) conversion from a correspondingly large amount of 
oligosaccharide substrate. Broad substrate peaks that disturb the 
baseline are a particular concern, even when perfectly Gaussian in 
the absence of peak fronting and tailing. At low substrate conver -
sion, separation of products from minor impurities present in the 
starting material must also be considered. Given the potential 
diversity of carbohydrate analytes and HPAEC media, it is not pos -
sible to provide a single-gradient solution here. Generally, how -
ever, the gradient should be as short as possible to maximize sample 
throughput while at the same time providing suitable analyte sepa -
ration. The program should also include a sufficiently long re-
equilibration step to maximize retention time reproducibility. 2.2 Enzymes 
and Oligosaccharides
3.1 Gradient Design
Using HPAEC for the Determination of Enzyme Kinetics
18
Some exemplar gradients employed in our lab for enzyme kinetics 
with linear and branched oligosaccharide substrates are given in 
Table 1.
 1. From individual monosaccharide and oligosaccharide stock solu -
tions, prepare six 40  μL solutions of 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10, 30, and 
50 μM in microvolume HPLC vials by dilution ( see Note 6 ). 
Independent replicates may be included as necessary to ensure 
statistical accuracy and precision.
 2. Using the programmable autosampler, sequentially inject 
10 μL of each solution ( see Note 6 ) into the HPAEC-PAD 
system and run the gradient program.
 3. For each chromatogram, integrate the product peaks ( see Note  
7) and plot integration (nC*min) against concentration.
 4. Apply linear regression analysis to determine the linear work -
ing range of the assay and calculate the slope (nC*min/ μM) 
for each product standard ( see Note 8 ).
Optimization of enzyme assays to generate accurate, publication-  
quality data is necessarily an iterative procedure in which substrate

Michaelis–Menten kinetic analysis, it is advisable first to estimate a 
suitable enzyme concentration for assaying each substrate of 
interest.
 1. Prepare a series of seven fivefold serial dilutions of the enzyme 
stock in 20  μL of the assay buffer in 200  μL PCR tubes  
(see Note 9 ). This results in the following broad range of 
 dilutions suitable for initial scouting: 1:5, 1:25, 1:125, 1:625, 
1:3125, 1:15,625, 1:78,125. A more limited range of dilu -
tions may be appropriate if prior information on enzyme spe -
cific activity exists.
 2. From the substrate stock solution ( see Subheading 2.2, item 5 ), 
prepare 0.5  mL of working solution in the assay buffer at a 
concentration roughly half of the anticipated KM value of 
the substrate. A working solution of 0.2  mM is often a useful 
starting point for many oligosaccharides (this concentration is 
typically below the KM value).
 3. Initiate the enzymatic reaction by adding 20  μL of substrate 
working solution to the first 20  μL solution of diluted enzyme. 
Gently mix by reciprocal pipetting or gently tapping the PCR 
tube; consistently mixing individual samples is essential for 
assay reproducibility.
 4. Immediately transfer the tube to a PCR thermocycler pre -
heated to the temperature optimum of the enzyme.
 5. Repeat steps 3  and 4 for each enzyme dilution, spacing the 
additions precisely by 30  s or 1  min.
 6. Include a blank reaction consisting of 20  μL of the working 
substrate solution mixed with 20  μL of buffer.
 7. Precisely 1  h after the addition of substrate to each tube, stop 
the reaction by heating to 95  °C for 10  min ( see Note 10 ).
 8. Transfer the samples to microvolume HPLC vials and inject 
10 μL of each sample into the HPAEC-PAD system using the 
programmable autosampler ( see Note 6 ).
 9. For each chromatogram, integrate the product peak(s) and 
subtract the integration of any peak observed at the same elu -
tion time in the blank sample.
 10. Convert integration values to product concentration(s), [P], 
using the linear calibration(s) ( see Subheading 3.2).
 11. For each product in each sample, plot [P] against the enzyme 
concentration in the assay ([E] t). In this stopped assay, enzyme 
concentrations that result in <  10 % conversion of the original 
substrate concentration (as determined by the sum of all prod -
ucts) can be reasonably assumed to give linear, initial-  rate kinetics 
suitable for subsequent, detailed Michaelis–Menten analysis. [E] t 
values producing <  1 % substrate conversion are preferred [ 23].

 1. Based on results from Subheading 3.3, prepare 700  μL of a 
diluted working enzyme solution from the enzyme stock solu -
tion ( see Note 9 ).
 2. In PCR tubes, prepare 80  μL each of eight dilutions of the 
oligosaccharide substrate, spanning a concentration range of 
ca. 0.2–20 times the anticipated KM value (e.g., 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 
1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 10, and 20  × KM). These solutions will be subse -
quently diluted 1:2  in the assay to give substrate concentration 
values, [S], spanning 0.1–10 KM [23].
 3. Equilibrate these solutions in the thermocycler at the desired 
assay temperature.
 4. Initiate the enzyme reaction in the first tube by adding 80  μL 
of enzyme solution to 80  μL of substrate solution. Gently mix 
by reciprocal pipetting or gently tapping the PCR tube; con -
sistently mixing individual samples is essential for assay repro -
ducibility. Place the tube back in the thermocycler.
 5. Repeat steps 3  and 4 for each substrate concentration, spacing 
the additions precisely by 30  s or 1  min. Randomization of the 
order of enzyme addition to the substrate tubes is recom -
mended to minimize systematic error resulting from any time-  
dependent enzyme inactivation in the working enzyme 
solution.
 6. Precisely 15, 30, 45, and 60  min after the addition of  
enzyme to each tube, sample 40  μL into individual PCR tubes 
and stop the reaction by heating to 95  °C for 10  min  
(see Notes 10  and 11).
 7. Transfer the samples to microvolume HPLC vials and inject 
10 μL of each sample into the HPAEC-PAD system using the 
programmable autosampler ( see Note 6 ).
 8. For each chromatogram, integrate the product peak(s)  
(see Fig. 1a).
 9. Convert integration values to product concentration(s), [P], 
in μM using the linear calibration(s) ( see Subheading 3.2).
 10. For each initial substrate concentration in the assay, plot [P] 
against time for each product ( see Note 12 ). Visually inspect 
the data for linearity and use linear regression to determine the 
initial enzyme-catalyzed reaction rate, vo, in units of μM/min 
from the slope of the linear range ( see Fig. 1b and Note 13 ).
 11. Starting from the stock enzyme concentration in g/L (=  mg/
mL) calculate [E] t in μM according to the equation below. 
Account for any intermediate dilutions to reach the working 
enzyme solution ( see Subheading 3.3), subsequent dilution of 
the working enzyme solution (80  μL) in the total assay volume 
(160 μL), and the enzyme molecular weight molar mass, Mr

4 Notes
 1. It is important to polish the working electrode regularly (every 
1–2 months) and replace the reference electrode regularly 
(every 6–12  months) to maximize reproducibility, dynamic 
range, and sensitivity of the electrochemical detector. The 
waveform described by Rocklin et  al. cycled at 2  Hz will mini -
mize wear of the working electrode [ 10].
 2. For highly anionic carbohydrates, sodium nitrate is a good 
alternative eluent providing stronger elution and lower viscos -
ity than many alternatives [ 24].
 3. To obtain more consistent retention times, carbonate contam -
ination due to absorption of atmospheric CO 2 by aqueous 
sodium hydroxide should be avoided. Work efficiently and 
consistently when preparing the sodium hydroxide solution 
(do not let stand exposed to the atmosphere or in glass vessels; 
the latter to avoid silicate dissolution). 50% NaOH stock solu -
tion bottles should be disturbed as little as possible and the 
solution should be drawn from the middle of the bottle to 
avoid withdrawing any precipitated carbonate. Once diluted, 
maintaining the sodium hydroxide solution under CO 2-free 
atmosphere will improve retention time reproducibility; 
equipment manufacturers can include a sparging apparatus for 
this purpose. Alternatively, solutions may be made fresh and 
replaced weekly to maximize reproducibility.
 4. Enzyme solutions should be prepared in such a way so as to 
minimize carbohydrate contamination. Enzymes obtained 
from culture medium should be thoroughly purified. Note 
that commercial enzymes obtained as freeze-dried powders 
may contain nonreducing carbohydrates (e.g., sucrose, treha -
lose, raffinose) as stabilizing/bulking agents, which may limit 
working concentration ranges in the absence of further purifi -
cation (e.g., dialysis). Polyethyleneglycol and detergents 
(especially anionic detergents) should be avoided; these can 
bind irreversibly to the column and reduce chromatographic 
performance. In our experience, most buffers work well, but 
the addition of hydroxylated compounds (e.g., tris, glycerol) 
will generate a large peak at the beginning of the chromato -
gram, thereby obscuring weakly retained carbohydrates. The 
presence of proteins, peptides, or amino acids can also pro -
duce small, unretained peaks. High concentrations of certain 
anions such as halides and mineral salts can cause unpredictable

23
elution times. In general, it is best to use the lowest practical 
concentration of buffer compounds and other additives.
 5. Substrates should be prepared at high purity with the same 
considerations as enzyme solutions. We have found that most 
research-grade purified oligosaccharides (e.g., from Sigma 
Chemical Company, St. Louis, USA; Megazyme International, 
Wickow, Ireland; or Carbosynth, Compton, UK) are directly 
suitable for use in HPAEC-PAD following dissolution and fil -
tration. If solubility is an issue, substrates may first be dissolved 
in DMSO and diluted with ultrapure water to a concentration 
that does not cause enzyme inhibition; DMSO does not inter -
fere with chromatographic detection.
 6. Sample volumes are chosen to enable 10  μL partial-loop injec -
tions, which require 30  μL plus a sufficient excess for accurate 
autosampling.
 7. Chromeleon 7 offers the ability to automatically process large 
numbers of chromatograms to quickly extract peak integra -
tions; the built-in Cobra algorithm can automatically identify 
and integrate peaks, including defining baselines. Cobra peak-  
detection parameters should be adjusted to maximize the con -
sistency of baseline prediction ( see Fig. 1a). The resulting 
integration values can be easily transferred into external graph -
ing programs for analysis.
 8. With the HPAEC-PAD system described, saccharide concen -
trations of 0.5–50  μM typically give responses within the lin -
ear range of the detector. If deviation from linearity is observed 
at high concentrations, electrode polishing may be required.
 9. Low protein binding (e.g., siliconized) microfuge tube or the 
addition of bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 
0.1 mg/mL should be used to prevent loss of enzyme activity 
due to adsorption on plastic surfaces.
 10. Alternatively, and especially for thermostable enzymes, stop 
the reaction by adding 10  μL of 0.5  M aqueous NaOH to give 
a final concentration of 0.1  M. To minimize base-catalyzed 
hydrolysis, maintain at 4  °C and do not store for extended 
periods.
 11. For substrate concentrations greater than 1  mM, a dilution step 
is highly recommended. High concentrations of substrate can 
negatively impact chromatographic performance and a large 
substrate peak can interfere with peak detection and integra -
tion. Quantitatively dilute the reaction to 1  mM initial substrate 
concentration immediately following enzyme inactivation.
 12. Measuring change in concentration over time abrogates the 
need to subtract a blank.
 13. Deviations from linearity may indicate a loss of enzyme activity 
during the assay, substrate depletion, or abnormally strong

Measuring Enzyme Kinetics of  Glycoside Hydrolases  
Using the  3,5-Dinitrosalicylic Acid Assay
Lauren  S. McKee
Abstract
Use of the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid reagent allows the simple and rapid quantification of reducing sugars. 
The method can be used for analysis of biological samples or in the characterization of enzyme reactions. 
Presented here is an application of the method in measuring the kinetics of a glycoside hydrolase reaction, 
including the optimization of the DNSA reagent, and the production of a standard curve of absorbance 
and sugar concentration.

1 Introduction
The 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) assay utilizes the inherent 
chemical reactivity of DNSA to detect and quantify reducing sug -
ars. The method was first developed with some variations in the 
1920s and 1940s [ 1, 2] in publications which partly established 
the chemistry of the reaction and the impact of assay conditions on 
the accuracy of measurements. The method was formalized in 
1959 by GL Miller [ 3]. This seminal paper established the reaction 
parameters and described an optimized reagent composition. The 
article had been cited more than 19,000 times by January 2017, 
underlining the huge utility of the assay. The method is simple and 
rapid to perform, and robust enough to be useful for analysis of 
many kinds of samples. Citing papers include thousands of studies 
on glycoside hydrolase activity, among them descriptions of puri -
fied recombinant proteins and natural mixtures of enzymes, and 
analyses of plant biomass degradation by chemical and enzymatic 
hydrolysis. Presented here is an approach to use the method for 
analysis of glycoside hydrolase reaction kinetics ( see Note 1 ).
The chemistry of the reaction is quite simple, and is shown in 
Fig. 1. The aldehyde or ketone functional group of a sugar is 
28
oxidized to a carboxyl group, and in the process the yellow DNSA 
compound is reduced to 3-amino, 5-nitrosalicylic acid (ANSA), 
which has a reddish-brown color and can be detected by measuring 
absorbance at 575  nm. This simple reaction scheme implies 1:1 
stoichiometry of sugar oxidation and DNSA reduction, but there 
are confounding factors. There may be side reactions, which is why 
different monosaccharides will lead to different color intensities, 
and other factors such as the presence of oxygen can also lead to 
inaccuracies in measurement. As a result, although this method is 
simple and highly flexible in its application, care must be taken to 
optimize the precise composition of the DNSA working reagent 
for each experiment, and to run multiple control experiments every 
time.
The major component of the working analytical reagent is 
DNSA dissolved in water. The protocol involves adding an equal 
volume of the working reagent to a sample, heating to 95–100  °C 
for up to 20  min to develop the color change reaction, then read -
ing absorbance at 575  nm with a UV–visible spectrophotometer. 
Additional components in the reagent serve to increase the accu -
racy and reliability of measurements.
The inclusion of phenol in the working reagent leads to an 
approximate five-fold increase in color change: the maximum color 
intensity for any given reducing sugar concentration is achieved 
with 0.2% phenol, so its inclusion is always advised. Lower concen -
trations of phenol can lead to a loss of linearity in the color change 
reaction [ 2].
Additional accuracy of measurements derives from the inclu -
sion of sodium sulphite (Na 2SO 3) in the working reagent. This 
compound serves to scavenge oxygen, preventing a loss of sugar 
due to destruction by oxidation. Early versions of the method 
flushed samples with nitrogen gas to achieve the same effect [ 3]. 
The inclusion of Na 2SO 3 has been shown to reduce glucose 
destruction by 70% [ 2]. It is therefore recommended that sulphite 
is included in the working reagent to improve accuracy, especially 
when measuring very low concentrations, as it leads to a noticeable

group is oxidized, and 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) is oxidized to 3-amino, 5-  nitrosalicylic acid (ANSA), 
resulting in a color change in the solution

increase in baseline absorbance, particularly when using a working 
reagent with a higher glucose content (Fig. 2).
The most significant variable in the preparation of the working 
reagent is the concentration of glucose included in the solution. 
While the DNSA reagent allows for precise measurement of reduc -
ing sugar concentration, it does so over a limited linear range of 
concentrations. It is therefore necessary to include glucose in the 
reagent in order to raise the overall reducing sugar concentration 
in analytical samples to be within this range. Standard curves with 
variable amounts of glucose in the working reagent are presented 
later in this chapter to show how increasing the amount of glucose 
extends the linearity of the assay’s response to cover lower sample 
concentrations. However, the increased absorbance values result -
ing from high glucose contents will also saturate the reagent in 
samples with high reducing sugar concentrations. It is therefore 
important that an appropriate amount of glucose be included in 
the working reagent, to allow for accurate measurements over the 
whole range of reducing sugar concentrations in the samples under 
analysis.
Many users add Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate) to 
samples after heating but before cooling and measuring absorbance, 
Fig. 2  The effect of the inclusion of Na 2SO3 in the working reagent. Absorbance 
values are increased as less glucose is lost due to oxidative destruction. For 
these samples, working reagent containing 0, 5, 10, or 20  μL glucose per 20  mL 
of DNSA solution (referred to respectively as DNSA 0, DNSA 5, DNSA 10, and DNSA 20) 
was added to an equal volume of water prior to color development

to stabilize the color change. The inclusion of Rochelle salt in the 
working reagent itself is a mistake, as it can interrupt the oxygen 
scavenging by sodium sulphite, thereby contributing to a loss of 
glucose [ 2]. However, the addition of Rochelle salt to a sample 
immediately after color development does stabilize the color 
change, leading to more repeatable measurements [ 2, 4], although 
a significant color change is required for this to be useful.
2 Materials
All solutions should be prepared using ultrapure water and analyti -
cal grade reagents. Solutions should be stored at room tempera -
ture, and will be stable for around 1 month, unless specified 
otherwise. Take heed of local regulations concerning chemical 
storage and waste disposal. The dry DNSA compound is an irritant 
and proper personal protective equipment should be worn when 
handling it. The DNSA solution in water has a pH of around 12.5, 
which also requires proper handling and disposal. Phenol should 
be dispensed and added to the reagent in a fume hood. Additionally, 
the DNSA solution stains surfaces, equipment, textiles and skin, so 
care must be taken when dispensing the liquid.
 1. DNSA stock reagent: 1% (w/v) DNSA, 0.2% (v/v) phenol, 
0.05% (w/v) Na 2SO 3, and 1% NaOH.  Weigh 5  g DNSA and 
0.25 g Na 2SO 3 into a glass beaker. Add 400  mL water and stir 
using a magnetic stirrer. Add 0.1  mL phenol, and make up to 
500 mL with water. Store at room temperature.
 2. 20% (w/v) stock of glucose: Weigh 100  g of glucose into a 
beaker and add 500  mL water. To improve the long-term stor -
age of this solution, it should be autoclaved or filter sterilized. 
The solution can then be stored at room temperature.
 3. Optional . 40% (w/v) solution of potassium sodium tartrate 
(Rochelle salt): weigh 40  g of Rochelle salt into a beaker and 
add 100  mL water. Stir using a magnetic stirrer. Store at room 
temperature.
 4. DNSA working reagent: take 20  mL of the stock reagent ( see 
step 1 ), and add glucose from the stock prepared in step 2 . 
Typically you will add 10–20  μL of glucose solution to the 
DNSA stock to make the working reagent, but this should be 
optimized for each new experiment to ensure that the linear 
range of response covers the reducing sugar concentrations in 
the samples under analysis. The working reagent is not suit -
able for long-term storage, as the presence of glucose will 
cause the color change to develop over time, leading to inac -
curate sample analysis. A small volume of working reagent is 2.1 Reagents

therefore produced when needed, and stored at room tem -
perature for no more than 2 days.
 1. For the standard curve, prepare solutions of glucose (or the 
most appropriate monosaccharide for your analyses, see Note 2 ) 
over a range of concentrations in the same buffer as will be used 
to generate the experimental samples. It is recommended that a 
first-time user of the method begins with 20 samples between 0 
and 1  g/L of monosaccharide, to become familiar with the lin -
ear range of the response.
Samples should be prepared in heat-stable 1.5  mL eppendorf 
tubes. A boiling water bath or high temperature heat-block is 
required for incubation of samples to induce the color change. A 
UV–visible spectrophotometer is required for measuring sample 
absorbance. The examples included in this chapter were analyzed 
using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian) and the Simple Reads 
software. Disposable plastic cuvettes can be utilized in the spectro -
photometer. Plotting software is required to generate curves and 
to analyze kinetic data.
3 Methods
All steps can be performed at room temperature, unless specified 
otherwise. The example presented is the hydrolysis of tamarind 
xyloglucan by a GH5 enzyme [ 5]. We therefore present a standard 
curve of glucose. You should use the most appropriate monosac -
charide for your standard curve. For instance, if you will examine 
the hydrolysis of xylan, make a standard curve of xylose.
First, perform some enzyme reactions to scope the likely range of 
reducing sugar concentration in the samples ( see Note 3 ).
 1. Prepare a DNSA working reagent by adding 10  μL of glucose 
(20% stock) to 20  mL DNSA stock. This is working reagent 
DNSA 10.
 2. Set up enzyme reactions in a final volume of 200–500  μL. The 
reactions should contain buffer, substrate, and enzyme, all at 
known concentrations. For this example, a reaction volume of 
250 μL containing 50  mM sodium citrate buffer, an enzyme 
concentration of 4.8  μM, and a substrate concentration of 
0.5 g/L are utilized.
 3. Incubate the reactions at an appropriate temperature for 1  h, 
or overnight if the activity is low, and then stop the reaction by 
adding an equal volume of DNSA working reagent.2.2 Samples

 4. Develop the color of the samples by placing the tubes in boil -
ing water or in a heat-block set to 95  °C, and incubating for 
20 min. Maximum color change may be achieved after a 
shorter time, and this can be optimized as an experiment 
proceeds.
 5. Optional step . Add 300  μL of Rochelle salt to stabilize the 
color change ( see Note 4 ).
 6. Place the tubes on ice briefly (up to 5  min) to cool to room 
temperature, to prevent fluctuations in the absorbance 
reading.
 7. Centrifuge the tubes for 1  min at 10,000  × g to pellet insolu -
ble material, including precipitated denatured protein, which 
could interfere with the absorbance measurements.
 8. Transfer the colored solutions to disposable plastic cuvettes. 
Read absorbance at A575. The typical expected range of color 
change is depicted in Fig. 3. At very high sugar concentra -
tions, the color change will be saturated, and samples will 
appear black. Highly concentrated samples must be diluted 
before  the addition of the DNSA reagent: diluting after the 
reagent is added and color developed will not give an accurate 
measurement of sugar concentration in the sample.
 (a) If the absorbance of the samples falls outside of the range 
of 0.1–1.0, fresh working reagent should be prepared 
containing more or less glucose (i.e., prepare working 
reagent DNSA 5 to decrease the color change, or DNSA 15 
to increase the color change).
 (b) The absorbance values shown in these examples are 
obtained without “blanking” the spectrophotometer 
against a water sample. The “autozero” function on the 
spectrophotometer can be used with a water sample before 
you start, but this must be consistently performed for the 
generation of the standard curve and the analysis of ana -
lytical samples.

DNSA working reagent containing 10  μL glucose (from a 20% stock) per 20  mL DNSA stock reagent. Samples

Prepare a standard curve of monosaccharide concentration vs 
absorbance at 575  nm, preparing the sugar solutions in the same 
buffer conditions as the analytical samples. The example shown is 
a standard curve for glucose in 50  mM sodium citrate buffer.
 1. Prepare serial dilutions of the monosaccharide from 0 to 
1 g/L.  Prepare 200–500  μL of each concentration, in 
triplicate.
 2. Add an equal volume of the appropriate DNSA working 
reagent, selected in the initial scoping process ( see Note 5 ).
 3. Develop the color of the samples by placing the tubes in boil -
ing water or a heat-block set to 95  °C, and incubating for 
20 min.
 4. Optional step . Add 300  μL of Rochelle salt to stabilize the 
color change.
 5. Place the tubes on ice briefly (up to 5  min) to cool to room 
temperature, to prevent fluctuations in the absorbance 
reading.
 6. Centrifuge the tubes for 1  min at 10,000  × g to pellet any 
insoluble material which could interfere with the absorbance 
measurements.
 7. Transfer the colored solutions to disposable plastic cuvettes. 
Read absorbance at 575  nm.
 8. Use a plotting software to produce a scatter plot of absorbance 
vs sugar concentration, and determine the equation of the 
straight line: this will be used to calculate the reducing sugar 
concentration in analytical samples using the absorbance 
measurements.
Figure 4 shows standard curves for the same range of samples 
using different amounts of glucose in the DNSA working reagent. 
With increasing amounts of glucose included, the linear range of 
the assay is expanded to cover lower sample concentrations, and 
the absorbance values increase, toward the limits of detection in a 
typical spectrophotometer. Absorbance values should be within 
0.1 and 1.0 to maintain accuracy.
 1. Set up enzyme reactions in a final volume of 200–500  μL. The 
reactions should contain buffer, substrate, and enzyme, all at 
known concentrations. In the example given here, we utilized 
50 mM sodium citrate buffer, an enzyme concentration of 
4.8 μM, and substrate concentrations from 0 to 8  g/L in a 
final reaction volume of 250  μL.
 (a) For each substrate concentration, a reaction should be 
allowed to proceed for several different lengths of time, to 
allow a time-course of the reaction to be plotted to make 
sure the reaction is being measured within the linear range 
of activity (Fig. 5).3.2 Generate

 2. For each time-course, take the slope of the line ( ΔA575 min−1) 
and convert these values to the concentration of glucose 
released per minute of the assay using the equation from your 
standard curve. It will be useful to then convert this to molar -
ity of glucose (M glc  min−1). Divide these values by enzyme 
concentration (M) to obtain the rate constant (min−1) for the

converted to s−1 by dividing by 60. Plot these values against 
substrate concentration, to generate a full kinetic plot for the 
reaction (Fig. 5).
 (a) Use a plotting software to perform nonlinear regression 
on the data and determine Michaelis–Menten kinetics of 
the reaction.
4 Notes
 1. The DNSA method is particularly useful for analysis of endo 
type hydrolysis of polysaccharide substrates. This is because 
the initial reducing sugar concentration in the substrate is low 
due to the length of the carbohydrate chains, and because 
endo chain cleavage generates a lot of new reducing ends. An 
exo type reaction, such as polysaccharide debranching, will 
generate comparatively fewer reducing ends, so additional glu -
cose in the working reagent may be required. An oligosaccha -
ride substrate will give a more intense background signal than 
a polysaccharide substrate at the same concentration (g/L) as 
there is a greater number of reducing ends per equivalent mass 
of substrate, so assays of oligosaccharide cleavage will require 
less glucose in the working reagent.
 2. When performing an experiment, a great deal of preliminary 
scoping is required to establish a reagent composition which 
will give reliable, reproducible measurements over the range 
of reducing sugar concentrations under analysis. It is impor -
tant that the standard curve of absorbance vs reducing sugar 
concentration be performed using the same reagent condi -
tions as the experiment. This initial scoping phase can be labo -
rious, but is preferable to having to begin again with a different 
reagent composition mid-way through an experiment.
 3. The most appropriate monosaccharide to use for your stan -
dard curve will typically be the major component of your poly -
saccharide substrate (i.e., use a standard curve of xylose for 
measuring hydrolysis of xylan, a standard curve of mannose for 
measuring hydrolysis of mannan, and so on). Different mono -
saccharides give different responses to DNSA treatment.
 4. The addition of Rochelle salt is part of the inherited protocol 
in a lot of laboratories, but the decision to include this step 
varies, as the benefit is not always apparent. The addition of 
the Rochelle salt should help to stabilize the color change if a 
significant coloration has been achieved and if added at the 
correct moment, but can instead dilute a  
sample and cause loss of color at lower color intensities.  
It is recommended that a first-time user of the DNSA method

An Improved Kinetic Assay for  the Characterization 
of Metal-Dependent Pectate Lyases
Darryl  R. Jones, Richard  McLean, and  D. Wade  Abbott
Abstract
Pectate lyases are a subset of polysaccharide lyases (PLs) that specifically utilize a metal dependent 
β-elimination mechanism to cleave glyosidic bonds in homogalacturonan (HG; α-d-1,4-galacturonic acid). 
Most commonly, PLs harness calcium for catalysis; however, some PL families (e.g., PL2 and PL22) dis -
play preferences for transitional metals. Deploying alternative metals during β-elimination is correlated 
with signature coordination pocket chemistry, and is reflective of the evolution, functional specialization, 
and cellular location of PL activity. Here we describe an optimized method for the analysis of metal-  
dependent polysaccharide lyases (PLs). We use an endolytic PL2 from Yersinia enterocolitica  (YePL2A) as 
example to demonstrate how altering the catalytic metal within the reaction can modulate PL kinetics.

1 Introduction
Polysaccharide lyases (PLs) are a class of carbohydrate active 
enzymes (CAZymes) that catalyze the cleavage of uronic acid con -
taining polysaccharides by β-elimination [1]. One of the most 
common terrestrial uronic acid containing polysaccharides is pec -
tin, which is a heterogeneous matrix composed of three main com -
ponents homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I), 
and rhamnogalacturonan-II (RG-II) [2, 3]. HG is an unbranched 
homopolysaccharide, the primary pectic component of plant cell 
walls, and the substrate of pectate lyases [3, 4]. The lytic cleavage 
of polysaccharides by PLs results in the generation of a new reduc -
ing end and a hexenuronic acid moiety (HexA) at the non-  reducing 
end of the leaving group. The formation of the unsaturated HexA 
provides a unique opportunity to directly monitor product forma -
tion using ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy at 232  nm without the 
need for synthetic substrates.
38
Despite a variety of determined protein folds [4, 5], the PLs 
demonstrate a high level of structural convergence within their 
active sites that is likely the result of limitations introduced by the 
chemistry of the substrate [6, 7]. β-Elimination catalyzed by PLs 
proceeds through three main steps: (1) neutralization of the charge 
on uronate group, (2) abstraction of the C-5 proton , charge delo -
calization, and oxyanion formation, and (3) protonation of the 
glycosidic oxygen and formation of the unsaturation between C4 
and C5 [1, 8, 9]. Neutralization of the uronate most commonly 
occurs through a bivalent cation, and can be assisted by basic or 
amidic amino acids [1, 8, 10]. In most metal-dependent PLs, cal -
cium is harnessed to neutralize the uronate group and stabilize the 
oxyanion intermediate. This is likely because calcium is present at  a 
high concentration (10  μM–10  mM) in the plant cell wall [5, 11]. 
Interestingly, some PL families (PL2 and PL22) have shown a 
 preference for divalent cations other than calcium, and recent work 
has shown that these PLs may display greater plasticity in metal 
selectivity than previously thought [7, 10, 12–14].
The metal cofactor is an integral part of the enzyme active site. 
Removing the catalytic metal with a strong chelating agent fol -
lowed by supplementation is the most commonly reported method 
for investigating metal selectivity in PLs [7, 10, 12]. This approach, 
however, can introduce high concentration ion microenviron -
ments, which can be detrimental to protein stability. Often these 
effects result in enzyme precipitation and prevent accurate mea -
sures of activity. To avoid these confounding effects, a more con -
servative approach can be used for exchange of metals within the 
active site. Recently, this method has been used successfully to 
report the effects of different metals on the kinetics of YePL2A, a 
member of the PL2 family from Y. enterocolitica  [14]. Here we 
describe this optimized approach for the exchange of metal cofac -
tors and quantitative analysis of metal selectivity in PLs (Fig. 1).
2 Materials
Prepare all solutions using ultrapure water and analytical grade 
reagents. Extreme care must be taken to ensure no contamination 
of solutions with any unwanted ions as trace contamination of 
optimal ions will be bound preferentially over the ion being tested. 
All glassware should be rinsed with copious amounts of ultrapure 
water prior to use. Prepare and store all reagents at room tempera -
ture (unless indicated otherwise).

setting.
 5. Repeat step 4 , and transfer dialysis tubing to the fresh bucket 
of 1× CAPSO Buffer for a minimum of 2  h. Keep an aliquot of 
enzyme from this step (“ edta treated ” ablation control).
 6. Prepare metal dialysis buffers, label six 1  L beakers 1–6. Add 
50 mL 10× CAPSO buffer and 445  mL chilled water to each 
beaker. Add 5  mL of the calcium solution to beaker one, 5  mL 
of the magnesium solution to beaker two, 5  mL of the manga -
nese solution to beaker three, 5  mL of the cobalt solution to 
beaker four, 5  mL of the nickel solution to beaker five, and 
5 mL of the copper solution to beaker six. Stir each beaker 
continuously ( see Note 4 ).
 7. Cut six lengths of dialysis tubing (approximately 5  cm in 
length), and soak each in water for 3–5  min. Seal one end of 
each, and divide the content of the dialysis tubing from step 5  
equally among the six lengths of tubing, fill each tube with no 
more than 2.5  mL of enzyme solution and seal the other end 
(see Note 3 ). Place one enzyme filled length of dialysis tubing 
in each beaker from step 6  and incubate for at least 2  h.
 8. Repeat step 6  and transfer the dialysis tube from step 7  into 
the corresponding beakers of fresh buffer, incubate with stir -
ring for at least 2  h.
 9. Transfer the dialysis bag contents from beakers 1–6 to tubes 
labeled “ calcium ”, “ magnesium ,” “ manganese ,” “ cobalt ,” 
“nickel ,” and “ copper ” respectively ( see Note 5 ).
 1. Turn on spectrophotometer and allow UV lamp to warm up.
 2. Prepare reaction blank at room temperature; 1  mg mL-1 HG,

CAPSO stock to a 1  mL quartz cuvette, and make up to 1  mL 
with water. Cover cuvette and invert 3–5 times to mix  
(see Note 6 ).

ture or until absorbance stabilizes ( see Note 8 ).3.2 PL Assay

 6. Repeat steps 4  and 5 with “ edta treated ” enzyme sample  
(see Note 9 ).
 7. Repeat steps 2–5  with “ calcium ,” “ magnesium ,” “ manga -
nese,” “ cobalt ,” “ nickel ,” and “ copper ” dialyzed enzyme 
samples with the addition of 1  mM of the respective metal, or

(see Note 10 ).
 8. For each digestion reaction, graph the absorbance at 232  nm 
as a function of time (minutes) and calculate the slope of the 
plot in units A232 min−1.
 9. With an extinction coefficient of 5200  M−1 cm−1 for unsaturated 
products, the calculated slopes from step 8 , and a path length of 
1 cm calculate the initial reaction velocities, V0, for each condi -
tion using the Beer–Lambert law ( A = ε c l) where A is absor -
bance, ε is the extinction coefficient, c is the concentration in M, 
and l is the optical path length in cm ( see Notes 11  and 12).
 10. To determine Michaelis–Menten kinetics, initial reaction 
velocities need to be measured over a range of substrate con -
centrations. Steps 1–9  should be repeated at 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 
1.5, 0.8, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1  mg mL-1 HG.
 11. For each enzyme and cation condition, plot the initial velocity, 
V0, over final enzyme concentration, [E] t, as a function of sub -
strate concentration, [S]. To determine kinetic parameters 
from these data, a Michaelis–Menten curve should be fit to the 
V0/[E] t, versus [S] plot according to the equation:
 VV K0= [] []+() max(/SSM 
where Vmax is maximal velocity, KM is the substrate concentra -
tion at which half of maximal velocity is achieved ( see Note 13 ).
4 Notes
 1. The β-elimination reaction requires an alkaline pH.  If the pH 
optimum of your enzyme is known the CAPSO buffers can be 
adjusted to this pH.  When comparing multiple enzymes a suit -
able pH should be selected, where all enzymes are similarly 
active.
 2. Quartz cuvettes are required for analysis at 232  nm.
 3. Dialysis buffer to enzyme should be at a minimum 200:1 ratio 
to ensure complete removal of ions. If there is more than 
20 mL total enzyme solution it is recommended to concen -
trate the enzyme sample by ultrafiltration. If concentration is 
not an option it is also possible to scale up the amount of 
dialysis buffer used, split your protein into smaller batches, or 
increase the number of dialysis exchanges performed.

pocket of the enzyme is composed of nitrogen ligands with an 
optimal geometry for the binding of transitional metals [7, 10, 
12–14]. Additional bivalent ions may be screened if the metal 
binding pocket of the test enzyme does not contain the signa -
ture histidine residues associated with transitional metal pref -
erence [10, 15].
 5. If there is any precipitate in these samples, centrifuge at 
10,000  × g for 10  min at 4  °C, then transfer the supernatant 
to a fresh tube. Quantify protein concentration by measuring 
absorption at 280  nm and using an appropriate extinction 
coefficient, which can be accurately predicted from enzyme 
primary sequence by ProtParam ( http://www.expasy.org/
tools/protparam.html ) [16]. An aliquot of the last dialysis 
buffer can be used as a blank.
 6. If using a smaller size cuvette or a quartz 96-well plate, scale 
down the digestion to an appropriate volume, be sure to note 
the path length of the cuvette.
 7. Enzyme concentrations resulting in measurable initial veloci -
ties will vary greatly depending on the enzyme under investi -
gation as well as the metal co-factor. It is recommended to 
start with 1  μM final enzyme, and optimize enzyme concen -
tration (1  nM → 1 μM final) such that linear rates can be 
observed in step 5 . If the reaction proceeds too rapidly to 
observe a linear increase in absorbance, the digestions can be 
prepared at lower enzyme concentrations starting at 500  nM 
and decreasing to as little as 1  nM. When selecting a final 
enzyme concentration it is crucial that the same concentration 
is used for all digestions.
 8. Recording time will vary depending on the activity of the 
enzyme and reaction conditions. It is essential to generate a 
linear rate for each reaction.
 9. Monitor this digestion reaction for the same amount of time 
as the “ untreated ” positive control reaction. Increased absor -
bance should not be detected as EDTA treatment should 
remove metal cations and ablate activity. If activity is seen 
repeat method 3.1 Dialysis, increasing the EDTA Buffer con -
centration in steps 1–3  from 2  mM EDTA, 20  mM CAPSO 
pH 9.0 to 5  mM EDTA, 20  mM CAPSO pH  9.0, and per -
forming step 3  twice.
 10. Addition of some ions can cause the gelation and aggregation 
of HG.  Blanks should be made immediately before zeroing 
the spectrophotometer.
 11. If a cuvette with a path length other than 1  cm was used, use 
the appropriate path length in the initial velocity calculation.

Colorimetric Detection of  Acetyl Xylan Esterase Activities
Galina  Mai-Gisondi and  Emma R.  Master
Abstract
Colorimetric detection of reaction products is typically preferred for initial surveys of acetyl xylan esterase 
(AcXE) activity. This chapter will describe common colorimetric methods, and variations thereof, for measur -
ing AcXE activities on commercial, synthesized, and natural substrates. Whereas assays using pNP- acetate, 
α-naphthyl acetate, and 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate (4MUA) are emphasized, common methods used to 
measure AcXE activity towards carbohydrate analogs (e.g., acetylated p-nitrophenyl β-d- xylopyranosides) 
and various acetylated xylans are also described. Strengths and limitations of the colorimetric assays are 
highlighted.
Key words Acetyl xylan esterase, Colorimetric assays, pNP-acetate, α-Naphthyl acetate, 
4-Methylumbelliferyl acetate, Acetylated xylooligosaccharides, β-Xylosidase-coupled assay
1 Introduction
Within the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) database ( www.
cazy.org ), acetyl xylan esterases are currently classified into carbohy -
drate esterase (CE) families 1–7, and 16, as well as the recently pro -
posed family CE17 [ 1–3]. Most of AcXEs employ a Ser-His-  Asp 
catalytic triad to catalyze the deacylation of substituted sugars [ 1], 
although family CE4 includes enzymes that employ a metal-  ion 
dependent hydrolysis mechanism [ 4]. Given the lack of low cost and 
well characterized acetylated xylo-oligosaccharides and xylans, broad 
screens for AcXE activity often begin by using p-nitrophenyl acetate 
(pNP-acetate), α-naphthyl acetate, or 4MUA [ 5–7]. Slight variations 
to the standard assay are summarized in Table 1. Whereas continuous 
product detection is possible through assays that use pNP-acetate, 
α-naphthyl acetate, and 4MUA, main limitations to using pNP-acetate 
is instability at alkaline pH [ 8]. Because 4MUA is more stable under 
these pH conditions, it is often the preferred substrate for determi -
nation of pH optima [ 7, 8].

Certain AcXEs, such as those belonging to CE4 family, exhibit 
no activity towards the chromogenic substrates described above [ 1], 
which has motivated the application of alternative commercial 
compounds (Table 2) and synthesis of additional substrate analogs 
(Table 3). These substrates have also been used to uncover the 
regioselectivity of AcXEs [ 9–14].
Following initial activity screens and determination of pH 
optimum, the specific activity and kinetic parameters of AcXEs can 
be determined using natural acetylated oligosaccharides and poly -
saccharides. For example, AcXE activity has been measured using 
native, acetylated xylan from birchwood [ 5, 14, 17], beechwood 
[17], and oat spelt [ 11], whereas oligosaccharides can be prepared 
through β-xylanase treatment of xylans [ 38–40]. Alkali extracted 
xylans can also be chemically acetylated prior to their use in activity 
assays [ 23, 41]. The release of acetic acids from these substrates is Table 1

typically measured by monitoring the drop in pH of reaction mix -
tures either directly [ 13, 42], or indirectly using a colorimetric pH 
indicator such as bromothymol blue (BTB) [ 43]. Such measure -
ments have been facilitated by the establishment of commercial kits 
that also permit indirect, spectrophotometric detection of acetic 
acid release (e.g., acetic acid assay kit from Megazyme (K-ACET) 
or the acetate colorimetric assay kit from Sigma (MAK086). 
Alternatively, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is 
widely used for direct, quantitative measurement of acetic acid Table 2

commonly used [ 1, 5, 17, 44]. Finally, nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (NMR), including 1H NMR and 2D-NMR, can be 
used to detect deacetylation products [ 45]. In particular, 1H NMR 
has been the method of choice to confirm the regioselectivity of 
AcXEs [ 46, 47], whereby release of acetyl groups can be continu -
ously tracked to distinguish enzyme action from spontaneous 
acetyl group migration [ 1, 34]. This chapter describes the main 
substrates and methods used to measure AcXE activity, and details 
five common methods for their colorimetric detection.

buffer pH 6.5 (or lower pH) and 1  mM pNP-acetate ( see Note 9 ), 
transfer 100  μL of a 500  mM stock-buffer (e.g., sodium citrate

 4. To initiate the reaction, add 100  μL of enzyme solution at an 
appropriate dilution for product detection. Negative control 
samples will substitute the enzyme solution for 100  μL of 
water or storage buffer for the enzyme. If measuring reaction 
rates, the enzyme dose must also ensure a linear relationship 
between reaction time and product release ( see Note 10 ).
 5. Directly measure p-nitrophenol formation at A405 nm using a 
1.5 mL cuvette; use milliQ water as the blank ( see Note 11 ).
 6. The absorbance of p-nitrophenol is pH dependent (Fig. 1). 
Therefore, a standard curve is required for each tested pH condi -
tion. The following p-nitrophenol concentrations are recom -
mended for 1  mL cuvette (i.e., 1  cm path length) at the specified 
pH value: pH 3: 0.75–9  mM; pH 4: 0.3–9  mM; pH 5: 0.03–
0.6 mM; pH 6: 0.05–0.5  mM; pH 7: 0.01–0.1  mM; pH 8: 
0.01–0.1  mM; pH 9: 0.01–0.05  mM; pH 10: 0.005–0.5  mM.
 1. To prepare a final reaction volume of 2  mL containing 1  mM 
α-naphtyl acetate in final 50  mM buffer, pre-equilibrate 20  μL 
of the 100  mM substrate stock solution with 200  μL of 
500 mM buffer and 1.58  mL milliQ water at the reaction 
temperature.
 2. Control samples are prepared as above without adding enzyme.
 3. Initiate the reaction by adding 200  μL of enzyme solution at 
an appropriate dilution for product detection ( see Note 10 ). 
Negative control samples will substitute the enzyme solution 
for 200  μL of water or storage buffer for the enzyme.3.2 Assay Using

 5. Add 1  mL of 0.01 Fast Corinth Salt stopping and dye 
solution.
 6. Read absorbance at A535  nm exactly 10  min after addition of 
the dye; milliQ water containing dye is used as the blank.
 7. To prepare a standard curve, dilute 100  mM α-naphthol 1:10 
with milliQ water and use 10  mM solution for dilution series 
containing 0.01–0.1  mM α-naphtol in cuvette with 1  cm path 
length after addition of stopping reagent.
 1. To prepare a final reaction volume of 400  μL containing 
100 mM buffer and 1  mM 4MUA, transfer 80  μL of a 500  mM 
stock buffer solution to 306  μL milliQ water and add 4  μL of 
the 100  mM 4MUA stock solution ( see Note 12 ).
 2. Control samples are prepared as above without adding 
enzyme.
 3. Mix and incubate the solution in a preheated water bath for 
5 min.
 4. To initiate the reaction, add 10  μL of enzyme solution at an 
appropriate dilution for product detection. If measuring reac -
tion rates, the enzyme dose must also ensure a linear relation 
between reaction time and product release. Negative control 
samples will substitute the enzyme solution for 10  μL of water 
or storage buffer for the enzyme.
 5. Incubate the reaction mix for 10  min at a specified temperature 
(see Note 10 ).
 6. After 10  min, add 600  μL of 50  mM citric acid (pH 2.2) and 
vortex rigorously to stop the reaction.
 7. Filter the samples through a 0.2  μm GHP Acrodiscs 13 filter 
(PALL) to remove insoluble particles prior to measurement 
(see Note 13 ).
 8. Transfer filtered samples into disposable 1.5  mL polystyrene 
cuvettes and read the absorbance at 354  nm; milliQ water is 
used as the blank.
 9. To prepare a standard curve, dilute 100  mM 4  MU stock solu -
tion to 10  mM in DMSO.  Use 0.01–1  mM of 4  MU for 1  cm 
path length after addition of stopping solution (for 96-well 
plate use 0.05–2.5  mM of 4  MU without adding of stopping 
solution).
 1. To prepare a final reaction volume of 200  μL containing 
50 mM buffer and 1.5% (w/v) oligosaccharide, mix 20  μL of 
500 mM buffer, 30  μL water, and 100  μL of a 3% (w/v) oligo -
saccharide to stock solution ( see Note 14 ).
 2. Control samples are prepared as above without adding enzyme.3.3 Assay Using

 3. Preheat the tubes containing substrate–buffer–water mix to 
the reaction temperature for 5  min.
 4. Initiate reaction by adding 50  μL enzyme dilution. Negative 
control samples will substitute the enzyme solution for 50  μL 
of water or storage buffer for the enzyme.
 5. Incubate with shaking (80–200  rpm) at a temperature and 
duration suitable for measuring reaction rates ( see Note 15 ).
 6. Detect acetic acids released using a commercial acetic acid kit 
or by HPLC after stopping the reaction with 40  μL of 0.33  M 
H2SO 4 or by heating at 100  °C for 10–20  min ( see Note 16 ).
 1. To prepare a final reaction volume of 250  μL containing 
100 mM buffer (pH 5–6) ( see Note 17 ) and 4  mM substrate, 
pre-warm 50  μL of 500  mM buffer together with 145  μL mil -
liQ water and add 5  μL of 200  mM mono-acetylated substrate 
stock solution.
 2. Control samples are prepared as above without adding enzyme.
 3. Initiate the reaction by adding 50  μL of enzyme mixture 
directly after the substrate addition. Negative control samples 
will substitute the enzyme solution for 50  μL of water or stor -
age buffer for the enzyme. Approximately 0.16  nkat of AcXE 
is reported to correspond to an A405 of 1.75  in 1 cm light path 
cuvette; absorbance values over 0.1 are recommended [ 35].
 4. Incubate the reaction mix for 10  min at 40  °C or less ( see 
Note 18 ).
 5. Add 800  μL of saturated Na 2B4O7 solution ( see Note 19 ) and 
measure absorbance at 405  nm.
 6. To prepare a standard curve use 0.003–0.3  mM 4-nitrophenol 
for both 1  cm light path cuvette or 96 well plate after addition 
of stopping solution.
4 Notes
 1. Acetonitrile was alternatively used to prepare 80  mM pNP- 
acetate stock solution [ 28]. In the product sheet of Sigma-  
Aldrich, methanol is recommended. Methanol (52%) was 
confirmed experimentally in our group to prepare a 10  mM 
pNP-acetate solution. Higher pNP-acetate concentrations or 
less than 52% of methanol led to precipitation. In methanol, 
stock solutions can be stored for about one week at 2–8  °C 
with only a small increase in free nitrophenol. By contrast, 
aqueous solutions should be freshly prepared each day (prod -
uct sheet of Sigma-Aldrich).
 2. 10 mM pNP can also be dissolved in 40% methanol (deter -
mined experimentally by our group).3.5 The

 3. The concentration of an enzyme stock solution is dependent 
on the enzyme preparation and dilution required in the assay.
 4. A 100  mM stock solution of α-naphthyl acetate in DMSO is 
insoluble if diluted to 10  mM with water. Alternative methods 
describe using 1  mM substrate in buffer (buffer is dependent 
on enzyme used) [ 25] or 5  mM stock solution in methanol 
[24]. The maximal concentration of α-naphthyl acetate that is 
soluble in aqueous solution is reported to be 2  mM [ 14].
 5. Fast Corinth Salt stopping solution contains insoluble parti -
cles. However, filtration can reduce product detection. This 
developing procedure is also pH sensitive.
 6. Alternatively, 4MUA is reported to solubilize as a 5  mM ace -
tone solution [ 28].
 7. Use of DMSO to dissolve 4MU is recommended in the prod -
uct information sheet provided by Sigma-Aldrich. 4MU is 
soluble at 1  mM in solutions containing 1% DMSO.
 8. β-Xylosidase should not be capable of hydrolyzing the mono -
acetates of 4-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranosides (NPh-Xyl), 
should be free of deacetylating esterases, and activity on 
4-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranosides should not be inhibited by 
acetic acid released by AcXEs.
 9. Concentrations of 1–2  mM of pNP-acetate are described for 
this assay.
 10. When determining rates of reaction, the reaction time is typically 
between 5–20  min, to minimize the chance of enzyme dena -
turation and conversion of more than 10% substrate.
 11. If absorbance of substrate is high, solutions containing sub -
strate but no enzyme should also be prepared as a negative 
reference.
 12. The 4MUA assay reported by Shao et  al. [7] begins by mixing 
the enzyme sample with the reaction buffer prior to substrate 
addition. This may be because the substrate can precipitate 
once suspended in aqueous solutions, depending on substrate 
concentration and reaction temperature.
 13. Depending on the reaction temperature, 1  mM of substrate in 
aqueous solvent may lead to precipitation, which can interfere 
with product detection. In this case, residual substrate can be 
removed by filtration prior to absorbance readings.
 14. Acetate buffer should not be used in this assay. The final substrate 
concentration will depend on the sensitivity of the detection 
method used.
 15. 200 rpm is indicated in Juturu et  al. [23]. The time needed for 
the reaction depends on the substrate concentration, enzyme 
performance, and sensitivity of the acetic acid detection method.

 16. Heating to stop the reaction is preferred in the cases where pH 
changes caused by addition of H 2SO 4 are not desirable. If the 
reaction products will also be analyzed by NMR to determine 
the regioselectivity of the enzyme, then the precautions against 
acetyl group migration that are described in Notes 17  and 18 
should also be applied.
 17. Acetyl group migration is avoided at pH 4, and is very low 
below pH 6 [ 34].
 18. Acetyl group migration is also mitigated by running reactions 
below 40  °C and for short incubation times (i.e., less than 
30 min) [ 34].
 19. Saturated Na 2B4O7 solution intensifies the yellow color of 
product but can also increase background detection of remain -
ing substrate.

Methods for  Determining Glycosyltransferase Kinetics
Maria  Ngo and  Michael  D.L. Suits
Abstract
Glycosyltransferases are a class of biosynthetic enzymes that transfer individual activated monosaccharide 
units to specific acceptors. Colorimetric assays using the detection of released products such as para-  
nitrophenol and coupled assays for inorganic phosphate detection allow for convenient and quantifiable 
kinetic characterization. These techniques may be applied to determine the enzymatic activity of glycosyl -
transferases by indirectly measuring the transfer of nucleotide-activated donor carbohydrate units to various 
cognate acceptor molecules. In addition to an overview of these methods, the protocol for quantifying the 
glycosyltransferase activity used for the characterization of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) involving the 
transfer of lipid II to form elongated murein chains during bacterial cell wall synthesis is described herein.
Key words Glycosyltransferases, Enzyme kinetics, Malachite green dye, para-Nitrophenol, 
Colorimetric assay, Lipid II transfer
1 Introduction
Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are biosynthetic enzymes that catalyze 
the transfer of phosphate-activated carbohydrate donors to specific 
acceptor molecules, resulting in the formation of glycosidic bonds 
(see Carbohydrate Active Enzymes; http://www.cazy.org /) [1]. 
For instance, in the case of glycosyltransferases, donor glucosyl 
units in the form of uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-Glu), a 
nucleotide-activated sugar, are conjugated to specific acceptor 
molecules to form products [ 2, 3]. While we overview three 
approaches for performing kinetic analyses with specific GTs, the 
methods outlined are broadly applicable for the kinetic character -
ization of GT systems in general. Specifically, we overview kinetic 
characterization of GTs through para-nitrophenol depletion, mala -
chite green dye inorganic phosphate detection methods, and 
fluorescamine-  labeled quantification via high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC).
The determination of optimal condition for kinetic characteriza -
tion, such as temperature and pH in which a GT reaction occurs 
may initially be determined using the relative absorbance of 
60
para- nitrophenol (pNP) at a wavelength of 405  nm under basic con -
ditions. This methodology was utilized for the kinetic characteriza -
tion of LgtA, an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase from Neisseria 
meningitidis , which transfers the glucosyl unit from the  glycosyl 
donor, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), 
to the glycosyl acceptor, 4-nitrophenyl- β-d-galactopyranoside (pNP-
β- Gal) (Fig. 1a) [4–6]. After a suitable incubation period for catalysis 
to progress, an exolytic β-galactosidase is added to the reaction to 
hydrolyze any remaining pNP- β-Gal to D-galactoside and 
p- nitrophenol. Under basic conditions, the resonance structure of 
p-nitrophenol to the p-nitrophenolate ion results in the develop -
ment of a yellow color that can be quantified at 405  nm, which cor -
relates to the amount of unreacted pNP- β-Gal remaining (Fig. 1b). 
As not all GTs are active under basic conditions, this type of analysis 
may involve quenching the reaction through the addition of NaOH 
as an endpoint assay. A lower absorbance value will inversely corre -
late with a higher level of activity from the enzyme because there is 
a lower amount of available pNP- β-Gal remaining in the reaction 
mixture [ 7]. In this way, the pNP-colorimetric assay is useful for 
efficiently comparing the relative absorbance values, and thus, rela -
tive enzymatic activity. However, this approach is not typically rec -
ommended for the characterization of enzyme kinetics for extended 
incubation periods due to its susceptibility to  auto-  hydrolysis that 
can give greater phenolate signals than expected [ 8].
Although auto-hydrolysis of pNP substrates may be largely cor -
rected against a suitable blank (buffer, control protein, acceptor, and 
UDP-donor only) [ 9], another method that provides a more sensi -
tive and reliable measurement of GT activity is the malachite green 
Fig. 1  (a) The overall reaction employed for the pNP- and malachite green assay in the following protocol. The 
incubation of UDP-GlcNAc (glycosyl donor) with pNP- β-Gal (glycosyl acceptor) in the presence of the enzyme 
will result in the transfer of the single glucosyl unit forming a glycosidic bond. ( b) The analysis of enzyme activ -
ity from the pNP-assay requires an additional step of adding a β-galactosidase to cleave the galactosyl unit 
from any unreacted/free pNP- β-Gal. The release of para-nitrophenolate from the glycosyl acceptor, emits a 
yellow  color and will allow an inverse quantification ( λ = 405 nm) of how much product was formed. A high 
signal of para-nitrophenolate indicates that there is low enzyme activity due to the amount of free glycosyl 
acceptors still available for reaction

assay [ 10]. This assay typically employs the optimal conditions that 
were determined from initial pNP-colorimetric assays. In this 
approach the malachite green dye reagent acts indirectly in that it 
provides a measure of the release of inorganic phosphate from 
reacted glycosyl donors [ 11, 12]. When the donor sugar unit is 
transferred to the glycosyl acceptor, the remaining moiety of the 
glycosyl donor is UDP that has a diphosphate attached to the nucle -
otide. A phosphatase can be added which will cleave the inorganic 
phosphate from the free end of UDP (Fig. 2). The addition of mala -
chite green dye reagent, which is initially yellow in color and can be 
read at 446  nm, will interact with one unit of phosphate to produce 
a large complex molecule concomitantly with a change to a green 
colour that can be quantified at 640  nm. A standard curve generated 
with inorganic phosphate from KH 2PO 4 will allow for the quantifi -
cation of free phosphate that remained following the GT reaction.
Lastly, the glycosyltransfer reaction at the core of the biosyn -
thesis of murein or peptidoglycan, is widely studied and involves a 
three-stage process of: (1) N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) conversion 
to N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) in the cytosol, (2) the addition of 
undecaprenyl phosphate to NAM to produce Lipid I, and (3) the 
elongation of murein through the glycosyltransfer of the 
Fig. 2  Following the same reaction as seen in Fig. 1a, the enzyme activity is measured differently in the mala -
chite green assay than in the pNP-assay ( see Fig. 1b). Rather than detecting the quantity of free glycosyl 
acceptor, the malachite green assay employs the use of CD39L, a phosphatase, to cleave the end of UDP to 
release an inorganic phosphate. With the addition of the malachite green dye reagent (originally yellow in color 
and quantifiable at 446  nm), the reaction will yield a malachite green–phosphate complex molecule indicated 
by a color change to green, which can also be quantified at 640  nm. The detection of released inorganic phos -
phate from the glycosyl donor directly correlates to the amount of product formed

carbohydrate units (Lipid II), fluorescamine labeling and transpep -
tidation reaction by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) [ 13, 14] 
(Fig. 3). The protocol described [ 15] involves more sophisticated 
equipment for detection than the two aforementioned methods. 
However, the detection of fluorescamine-labeled Lipid II provides 
a sensitive method for the characterization of glycosyltransferase 
activity at membrane surfaces where substrate decoration is bio -
logically significant, but the abundance of catalytic products is low. 
The reaction consists of reaction buffer, Lipid II (substrate), and 
PBP1b (GT-enzyme). In this reaction, the GT activity of PBP1b 
links units of Lipid II to produce an elongated chain. Lipid II is 
then labeled with fluorescamine for detection [ 16] and purified 
using an anion-exchange column through HPLC [ 17, 18]. The 
phosphate groups give Lipid II a net negative charge [ 19], allow -
ing purification using anion-exchange chromatography. The NAM 
moiety also provides the short peptide bond in which fluores -
camine can react with side group of lysine by adjusting the pH of 
the reaction above 9 (fluorescamine reacts with primary amine 
groups; lysine p Ka2 = 8.95). Finally, the measurement of free Lipid 
Fig. 3  Generally known as stage 3 of the biosynthetic process of the bacterial cell wall, penicillin-binding 
protein (PBP1b) elongates the formation of murein by transferring Lipid II to an extension of the carbohydrate 
chain. Here, PBP1b catalyzes the O-glycosidic bond between NAG and NAM units, which also releases unde -
caprenyl phosphate from the NAM unit. Fluorescamine is used to label the primary amine group belonging to 
lysine for quantification at an excitation wavelength of 380  nm, and emission wavelength of 470  nm

II is read at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 380  nm 
and 470  nm, respectively. Theoretically, the aliquots retrieved from 
the longer periods of incubation should result in a lower intensity 
of fluorescence for Lipid II as there would be less available sub -
strate for the GT reaction. Also, because only Lipid II is labeled, 
the detection of the peak should appear at the same retention time 
from any collected aliquots. Integration of the peak areas and com -
parison of an N-acetyl lysine standard curve may also be used to 
determine concentration of remaining Lipid II [ 20].

4 Notes
 1. Adding a small amount of water to the beaker prior to addi -
tion of dry masses helps to dissolve chemicals easier and pre -
vents clumping at the bottom.
 2. Use HCl or NaOH to adjust pH of buffer stocks appropriately.
 3. Prepare fresh stock of glycosyl acceptor if solution appears yel -
low due to auto-hydrolysis.
 4. Concentration of reaction enzyme may be adjusted higher or 
lower depending on the rate of activity.
 5. No preference for the type of microplate; however, round-  
bottoms allow better mixing for assay-type reactions, while flat-
bottoms allow for uniform surface and subsequent readings.
 6. Listed are only a few commonly used divalent ions that may 
affect activity of enzyme.
 7. Malachite green dye reagent should appear yellow in color in 
the absence of inorganic phosphate.
 8. Heating solution slightly may help improve suspension of 
polyethylene glycol.
 9. The pH does not have to be exact, as long as it is above pH  9.0 
because the p Ka of lysine’s side chain is ~8.95 for the ability of 
fluorescamine to bind.
 10. In total, six wells will be used: three blanks and three samples 
incubated at room temperature, and three blanks and three 
samples at 37  °C.

 11. Always add the enzyme last.
 12. Slightly tapping the microplate on a flat surface without splash -
ing may also help to mix reaction. Or a “shake” method can 
be applied from the microplate reader before readings if 
available.
 13. In total, 24 wells will be used: three blanks for each metal ion 
(Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+), three samples for each metal ion, three 
blanks for testing the absence of metal with EDTA, and three 
samples with EDTA.
 14. In total, 60 wells will be used: three blanks and three samples 
for each pH (50  mM MES pH  5.5, 6.0, 6.5, PIPES pH  6.5, 
7.0, HEPES pH  7.0, 7.5, 8.0, bicine pH  8.0, 8.5).
 15. Reaction buffer may be changed if a better yield of activity is 
produced than the default buffer (50  mM Tris–HCl, pH  7.5).
 16. Aliquots may be frozen with liquid nitrogen to prevent further 
activity while waiting for other time-aliquots. Or readings 
should be taken immediately after adding malachite green dye 
reagent to aliquot.
 17. Ensure no air bubbles are injected along with sample to pre -
vent flow rate or detection signal.

Analyzing Activities of  Lytic Polysaccharide

and Mass Spectrometry

Abstract
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases perform oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds in various polysaccha -
rides. The majority of LMPOs studied so far possess activity on either cellulose or chitin and analysis of these 
activities is therefore the main focus of this review. Notably, however, the number of LPMOs that are active 
on other polysaccharides is increasing. The products generated by LPMOs from cellulose are either oxidized 
in the downstream end (at C1) or upstream end (at C4), or at both ends. These modifications only result in 
small structural changes, which makes both chromatographic separation and product identification by mass 
spectrometry challenging. The changes in physicochemical properties that are associated with oxidation need 
to be considered when choosing analytical approaches. C1 oxidation leads to a sugar that is no longer reduc -
ing but instead has an acidic functionality, whereas C4 oxidation leads to products that are inherently labile 
at high and low pH and that exist in a keto-gemdiol equilibrium that is strongly shifted toward the gemdiol 
in aqueous solutions. Partial degradation of C4-oxidized products leads to the formation of native products, 
which could explain why some authors claim to have observed glycoside hydrolase activity for LPMOs. 
Notably, apparent glycoside hydrolase activity may also be due to small amounts of contaminating glycoside 
hydrolases since these normally have much higher catalytic rates than LPMOs. The low catalytic turnover 
rates of LPMOs necessitate the use of sensitive product detection methods, which limits the analytical pos -
sibilities considerably. Modern liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry have become essential tools for 
evaluating LPMO activity, and this chapter provides an overview of available methods together with a few 
novel tools. The methods described constitute a suite of techniques for analyzing oxidized carbohydrate 
products, which can be applied to LPMOs as well as other carbohydrate-active redox enzymes.

1 Introduction
The fact that LPMOs (previously known as CBM33 and GH61) 
are enzymes was discovered in 2010 by Vaaje-Kolstad et  al. [1]. The 
first described activity for a LPMO was CBP21 (or SmLPMO10A), 1.1 Chitin
72
a chitin-active C1-oxidizing bacterial LPMO.  The formation of oxi -
dized chito-oligosaccharides was analyzed at high resolution using 
hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) (Fig.1a) 
and MALDI-ToF (using both ion doping and isotope labeling; Fig. 
1b). The HILIC method was developed for separating native chito-
oligosaccharides and chitoaldonic acids in the same analysis. Whereas 
native chito-oligosaccharides retain well in acetonitrile–water, 
proper retention of aldonic acids (i.e., charged carboxylic acids) 
requires increased ionic strength and pH of the elution buffer.
In this early work, detection of oxidized oligomeric products 
by mass spectrometry was shown to be very useful, but also chal -
lenging, due to the equilibrium between the aldonic acids and the 
corresponding lactones; and the overlapping masses of the sodium 
adducts of oxidation products and the commonly observed 
K-adducts of the corresponding native oligosaccharides. In this 
respect, the combination of MALDI-ToF MS with isotope labeling 
and/or metal doping is very useful [ 1] (Fig. 1b, c). Metal doping 
is simple and should probably be used routinely. The use of label -
ing techniques is more complicated, but also a powerful tool for 
the identification of oxidations, as shown in Fig. 1b.
As predicted upon the discovery of LPMO activity on chitin in 
2010, LPMOs acting on cellulose were described soon after, in 
2011, by several groups [ 3–6]. Oxidized cello-oligosaccharides 
were analyzed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatogra -
phy (HPAEC; Fig. 2) and MALDI-ToF MS.  Analysis of cello-  
oligosaccharides requires different detection methods (e.g., pulsed 
amperometric detection, charged aerosol detection or ESI-MS) 
compared to chito-oligosaccharides because the former do not 1.2 Cellulose
Fig. 1  Analysis of C1-oxidized chito-oligosaccharides. ( a) UHPLC-HILIC analysis of oxidized chito-  oligosaccharides. 
Some ionic strength (15  mM Tris–HCl, pH  8.0) was essential to obtain retention of aldonic acids. Note that α and 
β-anomers would be separated under these chromatographic conditions if the oligosaccharide would have a 
normal reducing end (as in c, below). The lack of such separation thus indicates that the reducing end is modified. 
(b) (i) Equilibrium between the lactone form and the aldonic acid form of oxidized chitobiose. ( ii) MS analysis at 
lower pH (promoting the lactone form) without metal doping, showing both the lactone (1257 for the sodium 
adduct) and the aldonic acid form (1275 for the sodium adduct) of the hexameric C1-oxidized product, as well as 
the distribution of sodium and potassium adducts. Note that the mass difference between sodium (23) and potas -
sium (39) is 16. Furthermore, note that aldonic acids form diagnostic sodium and potassium salts, meaning that 
one proton is replaced by Na+ or K+. (iii) Analysis of the sample of ( ii) at higher pH (almost no lactone) and ( iv) after 
lithium (7) doping gives a simpler spectrum representing the chitoaldonic acids: m/z 1259 for the lithium adduct 
and m/z 1265, for the lithium salt of the lithium adduct. ( v) Fragmentation mass spectra of chitohexaaldonic acid 
(indicated above the spectrum) formed in reactions with H 216O (black ) or H 218O (red). Only the Y ions show m/z +2 
for reactions run in H 218O, showing that the oxidation is in the down-stream end. ( c) Analysis of GlcNAc 2 in its 
native and oxidized (aldonic acid) form. The oxidized disaccharide was generated by reaction of GlcNAc 2 with a 
chito-oligosaccharide oxidase called ChitO ( blue chromatogram; see [2] for details). Note that native GlcNAc 2 
(green  chromatogram) elutes earlier, and with anomer separation. ( a) and ( b) were reproduced from [ 1] with

absorb UV light. Aldonic acids are stable at high pH and HPAEC 
is therefore a suitable method for analyzing C1-oxidized cello-  
dextrins. In later work, it was shown that the normally time-  
consuming HPAEC procedure could be made much faster by only 
using a guard column that provides sufficient separation of aldonic 
acids and native species with a total run time of only 10  min  
(Fig. 2b; [7]). At the alkaline pH during the HPAEC analysis, the 
equilibrium between the lactone and acid is strongly shifted toward 
the aldonic acid, and this makes HPAEC ideal for analysis of 
C1-oxidized products (the p Ka of cellobionic acid is 3.5 [ 8]).
In contrast to the chemically stable aldonic acids, oxidation in 
the non-reducing end (C4-oxidation) results in products that are 
much more prone to decomposition at extreme pH.  It was recently 
shown that the gemdiols undergo on-column decomposition dur -
ing HPAEC [ 8] (Fig. 3), leading to products with additional oxi -
dations and, most importantly, native cello-oligosaccharides that 
have one less glucose that the original C4-oxidized product.
Due to this undesirable effect during HPAEC an alternative 
method based on porous graphitized carbon (PGC) chromatogra -
phy has been developed to enable simultaneous screening of C1 
and C4 oxidized cellodextrins (Fig. 4; [8]). PGC chromatography 
may be combined with charged aerosol detection (CAD), where 
sufficiently high sensitivity can be obtained by employing low ion-  
strength eluents (low nanomole range; [ 8]). While CAD

Mass spectrometry analysis of the compound confirms that it is a native trimer ( m/z = 527; sodium adduct).

detection provides sensitivity sufficient to enable kinetic analysis, 
limitations in product separation are such that the method is only 
suitable for oligosaccharides up to DP5, which needs to be taken 
into consideration when working with LPMOs that release higher 
DP products. Since the oxidative modifications in the non-reduc -
ing end render products with a high degree of similarity to native 
cello-  oligosaccharides several products tend to co-elute. The big 
advantage here is that the PGC-CAD method, in contrast to 
HPAEC, can easily be combined with MS detection which allows 
discrimination between co-eluting species. Furthermore, native 
products may be removed by treatment with a beta-glucosidase 10 15 20 min102030405060708090100

(which acts from the non-reducing end and will only work on the 
native compounds). Obviously, because of the partial co-elution 
of C4-oxidized products and their native counterparts, it is of 
utmost importance to ensure that there is no background forma -
tion of native oligosaccharides by contaminating cellulases.
The question whether or not LPMOs possess additional glycosyl 
hydrolase activity has been discussed repeatedly, due to the inher -
ent appearance of native oligosaccharides during product analysis, 
for both C1 and C4 oxidizing LPMOs. Native oligosaccharides are 
formed from the substrate when an oxidation event occurs close to 
the reducing end (in the case of C1 oxidation) or non-reducing 
end (in the case of C4 oxidation; Fig. 5). In order to investigate 1.3 Do LPMOs Have

the true occurrence of glycosyl hydrolase activity, the substrate 
may be reduced to its corresponding glucitol in the downstream 
end. Upon reaction with LPMO, any glycoside hydrolase activity 
would reveal itself by high release of native oligosaccharides com -
pared to the amount of reduced oligosaccharides. This approach 
was applied to C1-oxidizing PcGH61D (or PcLPMO9D) which 
resulted in increasing amounts of oxidized oligosaccharides com -
pared to glucitol oligosaccharides over time (3:1 after 4  h; 13:1 
after 20  h). Only minor amounts of native oligosaccharides were 
released, indicating that there is no significant glycoside hydrolase 
activity (Fig. 5; [4]).
C4-oxidizing LPMOs seem to produce larger amounts of 
native products, but this is due to chemcial modfications during 
the analytical process, as discussed to above. A nice overview over 
the (apparent) production of native cellodextrins by varying types 
of LPMOs may be found in Fig. 1 of ref. [ 7].
When analyzing C1 and C4 oxidized products using MALDI, a 
general feature for aldonic acids is that they form salts of their 
adducts, and this formation of double adducts is typical for carbox -
ylic acids ([ 9, 10]). Since the aldonic acid to lactone equilibrium is 
favored toward the aldonic acid under MALDI conditions, signals 
corresponding to the lactone form tend to be weak. For C4 oxi -
dized products, the 4-keto to gemdiol equilibrium is less skewed, 
and, due to efficient dehydration during spotting of MALDI sam -
ple plates, the keto signal (with m/z −2 compared to the native), is 
much more pronounced than the lactone signal (also m/z −2 com -
pared to the native) for C1 oxidized products. Thus, despite simi -
lar masses of the products (note that the aldonic acid and the 
gemdiol have identical masses too), mass spectra will show charac -
teristic differences that relate to C1 vs C4 oxidation. MS-MS 
approaches will yield different fragmentation patterns for C1 and 
C4 oxidized species [ 11]. In short, C4 oxidized species tend to 
show double water loss and dominant ring fragmentation, while 
C1 oxidized species do not exhibit these features during fragmen -
tation but instead show diagnostic decarboxylation. For details on 
fragmentation, readers are directed to Isaksen et  al. [11]. Extensive 
fragmentation data on xyloglucan is presented in Agger et  al. [12].
In mass spectrometry, analyzing products from LPMO reac -
tions is a major challenge because of the overlapping masses of 
common species. The mass difference of oxidized and native sugars 
is m/z 16 while the mass difference between sodium and potassium 
adducts is also m/z 16. In most experimental conditions both 
sodium and potassium adducts may be present, meaning that the 
native-potassium [M+K]+ and the oxidized-sodium [M+Na]+ spe-
cies will have overlapping m/z values. This poses considerable 
problems in interpreting MS data and ion doping ( see Subheading 
3) is regularly used to reveal the true nature of the products. 1.4 Analyzing MS

Importantly, modern mass spectrometers can achieve resolutions 
up to several hundred thousand using the orbitrap principle and 
Fourier transformation, while time-of-flight mass spectrometers 
typically achieve resolutions of up to around 40,000. By employing 
the newest high resolution methods it is actually possible to dis -
criminate between species with “overlapping” m/z values. Table 1 
shows relevant adduct pairs with overlapping m/z values and the 
resolution required for being able to unambiguously discriminate 
between those. Figure 6 illustrates the separation of these ion pairs 
using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer employing the orbitrap 
principle and demonstrates that differentiation between native 
potassium adducts and oxidized sodium adducts can be achieved.
Product identities have been addressed in various manners, as dis -
cussed above. Notably, the identities of both C1-oxidized cello-  
oligosaccharides [ 7] and C4-oxidized products have also been 
verified by NMR [ 11]. Initially, it was proposed that some LPMOs 
could oxidize C6 [ 6], but there is little proof to support this oxida -
tion mode, which, notably, would likely not lead to cleavage. This 
being said, it is not unlikely that other oxidations may occur, either 
directly by the LPMO, possibly as a side reaction, or indirectly, via 
tautomerization.
Continuous developments in research on LPMOs and other 
carbohydrate-  active redox enzymes will require an expanded reper -
toire of screening methods capturing a wider range of products. 
Today, LPMOs have been shown to be active on hemicelluloses 
(glucomannan, mixed linked beta-glucan and xyloglucan) [ 12, 13], 1.5 Verification

starch [ 14, 15], and xylan [ 16]. Some examples of LPMO action 
on more complex, natural samples have been shown in studies on 
xyloglucan and mannan by Agger et  al. [12] and studies on xylan by 
Frommhagen et  al. [16]. Another factor potentially contributing to 
sample complexity is the wide range of reductants that can activate 
LPMOs ([ 17, 18]). Certain reductants can cause challenges in ana -
lytics since sample compounds may give interfering signals. Since 
the effect of sample background varies depending on the choice of 
method (e.g., ascorbic acid has interfering peaks with C4 oxidized 
products in HPAEC, but not with C1 oxidized products) the effect 
of sample background must be evaluated for each individual ana -
lytical case. Furthermore, some reductants and the use of extreme 
reaction conditions may cause side reactions [ 19] which unavoid -
ably results in even more complex product mixtures. Below, we will 
outline several of the techniques currently used to detect the activ -
ity of LMPOs.Normalized AbundanceDP 2

pH 8.0 (B) for 4  min, then use an 11  min linear gradient to 
62% A: 38% B, which is held for 3  min.
 5. Recondition column by applying a 2  min gradient to initial con -
ditions and subsequent operate at initial conditions for 5  min.
 6. Monitor eluted oligosaccharides by recording UV absorption 
at 205  nm ( see Note 1 ).
 1. Use an instrumental setup as mentioned in Subheading 2.2 or 
similar.
 2. Centrifuge samples for 3  min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at

 4. Use the following gradient: 0–1  min, 100% eluent A (10  mM 
NH 4-acetate, pH  8.0); 1–15  min, linear gradient to 27.5% 
eluent B (acetonitrile); 15–28  min, linear gradient to 60% B; 
28–35  min, isocratic at 60% B [ 7] (see Note 3 ).
 5. Recondition the column by applying 100% eluent A for 9  min.
 6. The chromatography system was composed as follows: Dionex 
UltiMate3000 RSLC set up with detection by electrospray 
ionization-  MS (VelosPro LTQ linear iontrap, Thermo 
Scientific) or optionally with parallel use of MS with a Charged 
Aerosol Detector (CAD) (ESA inc., Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA). 
ESI-MS detection is used for qualitative detection, whereas the 
CAD is used for quantitation. The CAD detector is a universal 
detector, where the response is independent of the analyte, 
making it possible to prepare calibration curves with easily 
accessible standards that are structurally similar, but not identi -
cal, to the analyte. Such standards need to have the same elu -
tion time as the analyte to prevent gradient effects ( see Note 3 ).
 1. To prepare samples for MALDI-ToF analysis reactions should 
be run at low buffer concentrations (as a rule of thumb, less 
than 50  mM, but lower is better), and no MS-incompatible 
ions like phosphate/nitrate should be used.
 2. Centrifuge samples in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum 
speed for 2  min at room temperature.
 3. Apply 2  μL saturated DHB solution to a MALDI plate.
 4. Apply 1  μL sample, and mix with 3).
 5. Dry the spot under a stream of warm air.
 6. Analyze the sample on a MALDI-ToF instrument ( see Note 4A ).
 7. Mix 1  μL sample with 9  μL LiCl solution and vortex for 5  s.
 8. Apply 2  μL saturated DHB solution to a MALDI plate. DHB 
is the standard matrix used for all MALDI experiments, but 
other matrices may work equally well.
 9. Add 1  μL of the lithium-doped sample from (1) to (2) and mix.
 10. Dry the spot under a stream of warm air.
 11. Analyze the sample on a MALDI-ToF instrument ( see Note 4B ).
The following procedure describes the manual analysis of oligosac -
charides using direct injections on a Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole 
orbitrap mass spectrometer. Other high-resolution mass spectrom -
eters equipped with a nano-flow ion source can also be used with 
minor adaptations of this protocol.
 1. Mount the Nanospray Flex ion source to the Q-Exactive, and 
change the nano head to the Offline nano ES head to allow 
manual use of tapered capillary emitters.3.4 MALDI-ToF

 2. Prepare the sample by diluting with water or potassium chlo -
ride (1.5  mM) when conducting potassium doping.
 3. Cut the emitter to a suitable length and load 3  μL sample 
directly into the emitter using a gel-loader tip. Avoid bubbles. 
Use a new emitter for every sample.
 4. Assemble the emitter in the ion source and position the tip in 
front of the skimmer and apply positive pressure using a syringe 
to start the liquid flow. If no flow is observed, a gentle “crash” 
into the skimmer to scratch the emitter tip may be necessary. 
The optimal flow lays between 50 and 300  nL/min and, 
although this is difficult to control, the flow rate can be esti -
mated by the time it takes for the complete sample to be injected 
(i.e., 3  μL fully injected in 10  min gives a flow of 300  nL/min).
 5. Apply the settings from Table 2 and switch on the Q-Exactive. 
Adjust the emitter position and the spray voltage, if needed, to 
achieve a stable spray.
 6. Acquire MS full scan data for 20  s. Optionally, the Q-Exactive 
can be set to cycle between MS full scans and MS/MS fragment 
scans by providing an inclusion list of selected precursor ions. 
Fragmentation can be achieved using stepped normalized colli -
sion energy from 25 to 48. In order to achieve high quality MS/
MS spectra, the number of microscans should be at least three 
and the maximum injection time set to 800  ms. ( see Note 5 ).

Stable isotope reagents such as H 218O and 18O2 can be used in 
LPMO reactions to demonstrate the incorporation of molecular 
oxygen and water in the products formed by these enzymes. 
Identification of products containing the 18O isotope is achieved 
by mass spectrometry where products have m/z +2 compared to 
products formed in 16O conditions. Such experiments and product 
analysis have been described in detail in Vaaje-Kolstad et  al. [1] and 
the protocols used by these authors are outlined below. The reac -
tion volume, substrate concentrations, etc. described are optimal 
for demonstrating activity of a chitin-active LPMO toward chitin, 
but may need optimization if the methods are used for other sub -
strates and enzymes.
 1. Suspend 2.0  mg of dry substrate in 1.0  mL pure H 218O in a 
2.0 mL glass vial. This leaves a headspace of approximately 
1 mL when the vial is sealed. Seal the vial airtight and mix 
thoroughly. Let the substrate suspension hydrate overnight at 
room temperature.
 2. Dissolve a sufficient amount of reducing agent (e.g., ascorbic 
acid) in an appropriate volume of pure H 218O to yield a final 
concentration of 1.0  M. Keep the solution in an aluminum foil 
wrapped test tube (to shield from light) on ice.
 3. In order to achieve the correct pH in the H 218O reaction solu -
tion, transfer 10  μL of a 1.0  M nonvolatile buffer (e.g., Tris–
HCl pH  8.0) to a 2.0  mL glass vial and evaporate off the liquid 
by heating with dry air (approximately 60  °C).
 4. Transfer 498  μL of the substrate suspension to the glass vial 
containing the dried buffer and mix thoroughly to dissolve the 
buffer components. Subsequently, add 0.5  μL of the reducing 
agent solution (dissolved in H 218O) and 0.75  μL of a 660  μM 
solution of the LPMO (dissolved in H 216O) to the buffered 
substrate suspension to yield final concentrations of 1  mM 
reducing agent and 1  μM enzyme. A high concentration of the 
enzyme stock solution is desirable in order to keep H 216O con -
tamination at a minimum (replacing the H 216O in the enzyme 
stock solution to H 218O is possible, but is not considered as an 
option due to the high cost of pure H 218O).
 5. Seal the glass vial airtight and incubate the reaction for an appro -
priate time (usually 1  h or more) at an appropriate temperature 
(enzyme dependent) and with vigorous mixing (e.g., 1000  rpm 
in an Eppendorf Thermomixer).analyze products by MS.
 1. Prepare a buffered LPMO reaction solution (e.g., 20  mM 
Tris–HCL pH  8.0) containing 2.0  mg/mL substrate and 
1.0 mM reducing agent (e.g., ascorbic acid) in a glass vial that 
can be closed airtight with a screw cap containing a Teflon 
coated rubber septum. Make sure that the reaction volume 
only represents approximately 50% of the vial volume.3.6 Isotope Labeling

 2. Close the vial tightly with the screw cap and connect to a 
Schlenk line (for details, see procedure described under the 
heading “molecular oxygen free reaction” in Vaaje-Kolstad 
et al. [1] to remove oxygen from the headspace and dissolved 
oxygen from the solution. This is achieved by performing five 
cycles of degassing and N 2 filling. It is important to have a 
slight N 2 over pressure after the final N 2 filling in order to 
avoid contamination of the head space with air when remov -
ing the vial from the Schlenk line.
 3. Remove the vial from the Schlenk line and perforate the sep -
tum with the needle of a Hamilton syringe preloaded with a 
concentrated LPMO solution. Add the LPMO to the reaction 
mixture by injecting an appropriate volume (as low as possible 
in order to minimize addition of dissolved 16O2) to a final con -
centration of 1.0  μM. Withdraw the Hamilton syringe from 
the vial.
 4. Connect a gas cylinder containing compressed 18O2 gas to the 
vial by pushing a needle fitted to the outlet of the gas cylinder 
through the vial septum.
 5. Using the Schlenk line, place the vial under vacuum in order 
to remove atmospheric gas residing in the tubing connected 
to the 18O2 gas container and the headspace of the vial.
 6. Disconnect the vial from the Schlenk line needle and fill the 
head space of the vial with 18O2 gas by slowly opening the gas 
cylinder regulator.
 7. After 30  s, close the gas cylinder regulator and carefully remove 
the needle from the vial.
 8. Incubate the vial containing the LPMO reaction mixture for 
an appropriate number of hours (usually 1–24) at the desired 
 temperature with vigorous mixing (e.g., 1000  rpm in an 
Eppendorf Thermomixer) and analyze products by MS.
 9. The lactone—aldonic acid equilibrium will lead to exchange of 
oxygen atoms ( see Note  6).
Reduced phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) can be pre -
pared with the following procedure:
 1. Use a 2  mL 2% (w/v) PASC suspension in water and centri -
fuge for 3  minutes at 21,000  × g. Remove the supernatant and 
resuspend the pellet in 1  mL MilliQ H 2O. Centrifuge again 
for 3 minutes at 21,000  × g and remove the supernatant.
 2. Resuspend the pellet in 4  mL 12.5  mM NaOH.
 3. Add 25  mg NaBH 4 and leave the tubes at ambient tempera -
ture overnight with occasional stirring.
 4. Quench the reaction by neutralizing with 100  μL glacial acetic 
acid, followed by centrifugation as described above.3.7 Reduction

 5. Wash the pellet four times with MilliQ H 2O and finally 
 resuspend in MilliQ H 2O to obtain a 2% (w/v) solution of 
reduced PASC.
In this chapter we outline several crucial aspects of carbohydrate 
analysis that can be applied to analyze soluble products generated 
by LPMOs. More work is needed for developing effective methods 
for monitoring the insoluble products, i.e., oxidations on the insol -
uble material. Insight into oxidations on insoluble products may in 
some case be obtained by completely solubilizing LPMO-treated 
material with hydrolases and then analyze soluble oxidized prod -
ucts. Less quantitative methods based on labeling oxidized chain 
ends and microscopy are also available [ 20]. In addition to this, the 
field of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in both the aqueous 
and nonaqueous mode has seen large improvements in the past 
years. In particular, several column producers today design SEC 
columns for UHPLC conditions and this enables higher through -
put, higher resolution, and smaller injection volumes than what we 
have seen so far. Using SEC in ionic liquid mode for analyzing 
molecular distributions in cellulose [ 21] as well as for studying the 
molecular distribution of product mixtures after enzymatic treat -
ments has a large potential to broaden our understanding of the 
effects of LPMO treatments.
Research on LPMOs has only just begun and, despite major 
achievements [ 22–24], there is much exciting research ahead. The 
analytical tools described above will be invaluable for further 
unravelling of LPMO function in nature and in the biorefinery.
4 Notes
 1. Samples must have the same proportion of organic solvent as 
in the chromatographic starting conditions, if not, this is likely 
to compromise resolution. Some ionic strength (provided by 
the added Tris–HCl) is needed in order to obtain retention of 
the aldonic acids. Furthermore, an adapted version of this 
method that is more suitable for the shortest products appears 
in [2]. This study also describes a method for enzymatically 
generating chitoaldonic acid standards using a chito-oligosac -
charide oxidase [ 2].
 2. (A) When eluents are prepared note that when approx half of 
the 50% NaOH solution has been used, discard the remaining 
for the purpose of mobile phase preparation due to risk of 
carbonate contamination. It is critical to follow this procedure 
for mobile phase preparation or to follow equivalent recom -
mendations by the instrument vendor, in order to achieve sat -
isfactory quality of analysis. The most important things to pay 
attention to are (a) water and chemical quality, (b) sufficient 3.8 Future 
Perspectives

89
degassing for removal of dissolved carbon dioxide, (c) storage 
in atmospheres with reduced content of carbon dioxide (N 2 or 
He-saturated headspace), (d) regular change of mobile phases 
(2–3 days shelf life), and (e) to avoid all kinds of detergents in 
mobile phases, hence no detergent washing of mobile phase 
bottles between eluent preparations. Restrict cleaning to rins -
ing with Milli-Q water (Type I, 18.2  MΩ cm). Extensive 
exchange of mobile phases on the column and regeneration 
after each eluent changes is also important in order to remove 
accumulation of carbonate contaminations on the column 
which compromise resolution. (B) This method is used for 
native and oxidized cello-oligosaccharides, and may be adapted 
to be used for xyloglucan fragments as described in [ 12]. If 
there is a need for higher throughput, a 10  min method for 
separation and detection of aldonic acids may be used [ 7]. (C) 
For validation purposes HPAEC may be coupled to ESI-MS as 
explained in [ 8], but this requires anion suppressor, additional 
pumps and flow splitting. If you do not have access to online 
MS detection with your HPAEC a simpler approach that does 
not require a complex instrument setup and is based on offline 
MS is described in [ 8]. In short the latter procedure implies 
manual fractionation, desalting and MS analysis by MALDI-
ToF, direct infusion ESI-  MS, or injection onto another, sim -
pler LC-MS system.
 3. The elution of products may vary slightly depending on which 
UHPLC system you are using. This is due to for example vary -
ing dead volumes/gradient mixing in the hardware that is 
used. Gradient needed may PGC allows simultaneous detec -
tion of C1 and C4 oxidized products only in the range from 
DP2-5. See details in Westereng et  al. [8]. Native cello-oligo -
saccharides co-elute with C4-oxidized cello-oligosaccharides 
and double oxidized compounds co-elute with C1-oxidized 
oligosaccharides.
Due to incompatibility between an alkaline mobile phase 
and the detection principle of CAD, it is beneficial to lower 
the pH of eluent A to 6.5  in cases where CAD is applied [ 8]. 
Sensitivity in the low nanomole range is usually needed and 
improved sensitivity with CAD may be achieved by lowering 
the ionic strength. Analysis of uncharged compounds may be 
achieved at ionic strengths down to 1  μM NaCl and this 
enables product quantification with a sensitivity that is suitable 
for characterizing LPMO activities [ 8].
 4. (A) Under standard conditions, more than one type of adduct 
is commonly observed during MALDI analysis. The most 
dominant adduct is sodium, but also potassium, hydrogen, 
and NH 4 adducts can occasionally be observed. One simple 
way of overcoming this multiplicity of signals, which hampers 
Analyzing Activities of  Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases…
90
product identification, is ion doping to force the adduct 
composition to a defined adduct type. An example of lithium 
doping is given in Fig. 1, which shows complete lithium 
adduct formation. (B) Normally the mixing of the sample 
and the LiCl solution (or other doping reagent) as indicated 
is sufficient to achieve  complete doping. Testing two to three 
different concentrations of doping reagent may be necessary 
to find conditions that provide sufficient doping. Note that 
adding too much of doping reagent can give problems due to 
ion suppression. It is important to run LPMO reactions with 
low buffer concentrations in order to avoid ion suppression 
and extensive background signals. Doping with other ion 
salts, such as NaCl and KCl, may be performed in a similar 
manner as outlined above, but note that adduct formation 
efficiency varies between ions. Details on adduct formation 
may be found in [ 25].
 5. The actual flow rate in the emitter is difficult to control and is 
dependent on several factors such as sample viscosity, emitter 
opening size, applied positive pressure, distance from needle to 
skimmer, and spray voltage. Some trial and error must be 
expected to optimize these parameters. Typically, without spray 
voltage applied, the positive pressure alone should be able to 
form small droplets at the emitter tip. If no liquid appears, a 
small “crash” into the skimmer may scratch the emitter open. 
If too much liquid comes out, the emitter opening is too large, 
and a new emitter needs to be installed. This method is not 
applicable for high-throughput analysis or quantitative mea -
surements as a new emitter, including manual optimization, is 
needed for each sample.
 6. Aldonic acids dissolved in aqueous buffers are in a pH-  
dependent equilibrium with the corresponding δ-lactone. The 
δ-lactone is formed by dehydration of the aldonic acid. The 
aldonic acids is re-formed by hydrolysis of the δ-lactone. Thus, 
when performing 18O–isotope labeling experiments, care must 
be taken to avoid (a) exchange of the incorporated 18O atom 
with 16O 18O2 experiments and (b) incorporation of a second 
18O atom in H 218O experiments. Since the aldonic acid- δ- 
lactone equilibrium is strongly dominated by the aldonic acid 
at alkaline pH, it is preferable to conduct isotope labeling 
experiments at pH>7. The isotope labeling experiments per -
formed by Vaaje-Kolstad et  al. [1] were all conducted at 
pH 8.0. At this pH the δ-lactone forms of the C1 oxidized 
products are not observed using MALDI-ToF MS and the 
equilibrium is such that there is enough time to carry out 
product analyses before the exchange of oxygen atoms 
becomes noticeable.

Carbohydrate Depolymerization by Intricate  
Cellulosomal Systems

Abstract
Cellulosomes are multi-enzymatic nanomachines that have been fine-tuned through evolution to efficiently 
deconstruct plant biomass. Integration of cellulosomal components occurs via highly ordered protein–protein 
interactions between the various enzyme-borne dockerin modules and the multiple copies of the cohesin 
modules located on the scaffoldin subunit. Recently, designer cellulosome technology has been established 
to provide insights into the architectural role of catalytic (enzymatic) and structural (scaffoldin) cellulo -
somal constituents for the efficient degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides. Owing to advances in 
genomics and proteomics, highly structured cellulosome complexes have recently been unraveled, and the 
information gained has inspired the development of designer cellulosome technology to new levels of 
complex organization. These higher-order designer cellulosomes have in turn fostered our capacity to 
enhance the catalytic potential of artificial cellulolytic complexes. In this chapter, methods to produce and 
employ such intricate cellulosomal complexes are reported.

1 Introduction
Plant cell wall polysaccharides, primarily cellulose and hemicellulose, 
comprise a major reservoir of carbon and energy. The complex 
construction of the plant cell wall restricts accessibility of its carbo -
hydrate components to enzymatic attack, and, consequently, the 
recycling of photosynthetically fixed carbon is a relatively ineffi -
cient biological process of increasing biotechnological importance. 
Limited numbers of microorganisms are capable of deconstructing 
and utilizing recalcitrant carbohydrates as carbon sources. Enzyme 
systems produced by these microorganisms comprise diverse and 
extensive consortia of multimodular enzymes that either act freely 
or are organized in high-molecular-mass multi-  enzyme complexes 
termed cellulosomes [ 1]. The most efficient natural cellulolytic 
system known is produced by the anaerobic thermophilic bacterium, 
94
Clostridium thermocellum , which possesses a well characterized 
cellulosome system [ 2].
The major player in cellulosome organization is a non-catalytic 
primary scaffoldin subunit, which binds the entire complex to its 
substrate via a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) and incorpo -
rates different enzymes via specific high-affinity multi-modular 
cohesin–dockerin interactions [ 3, 4]. The primary scaffoldin 
anchors the cellulosome onto the bacterial cell surface through the 
interaction of its own C-terminal dockerin to cohesins located in 
cell-bound anchoring scaffoldins [ 3].
Cellulosomal systems of Acetivibrio cellulolyticus  [5, 6], 
Ruminococcus flavefaciens  [7], and more recently Clostridium 
clariflavum  [8–10] (Fig. 1) contain adaptor scaffoldins which 
mediate the binding between the enzyme-bearing primary scaffoldin 
and cell surface-anchoring scaffoldins. The intricacy and reticulated 
nature of these cellulosomal architectures is believed to improve 
cellulosome flexibility through the amplification of  possible 
Fig. 1  Organization of the Clostridium clariflavum  cellulosome. The cellulosome of C. clariflavum  is the largest 
cellulosomal complex known up to date, constructed of an octavalent (eight cohesins) primary scaffoldin (ScaA) 
that interacts with the pentavalent adaptor scaffoldin (ScaB), which, in turn, interacts with the tetravalent 
anchoring scaffoldin (ScaC) that attaches the complex to the bacterial cell surface. Altogether, this complex can 
contain up to 160 enzymatic subunits. In addition to the trifold arrangement of scaffoldins and enzymes pre -
sented in the figure, the bacterium produces ten additional scaffoldins. Thus, a variety of other cellulosome 
assemblies are produced by C. clariflavum , involving the different scaffoldins and dockerin-bearing enzymes

enzymatic compositions, which allows the bacterium to easily adapt 
to environmental changes related to substrate composition. Recently, 
the key elements cellulosome have been uncovered. Proteomic 
approaches have been used to characterize cellulosome complexes 
of C. clariflavum  grown on different cellulosic substrates [ 10], 
revealing how cellulosome composition and enzymatic activity is 
adapted as a function of the carbon source.
The Lego-like nature of the cellulosomal subunits may be 
transformed by mixing and matching different cohesin–dockerin 
pairs to assemble artificial cellulosome-like systems, referred to as 
designer cellulosomes [ 11]. These artificial nanodevices comprise a 
chimaeric scaffoldin with cohesin modules of divergent specificity, 
usually derived from different bacteria, and allow the controlled 
incorporation of recombinant matching dockerin-bearing enzymes 
that might benefit from enzyme proximity (Fig. 2). The designer 
cellulosome concept is based on the high affinity and specific inter -
action between a cohesin and a dockerin [ 12].
While the overall architecture of designer cellulosomes is 
generally quite simple, a more elaborate type of artificial cellulo -
some exists, characterized by the presence of an adaptor chimaeric 
scaffoldin [ 13]. The adaptor scaffoldin enables both enhanced 
Fig. 2  Schematic representation of the designer cellulosome concept. The chimae -
ric scaffoldin is composed of a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) with three 
cohesins (1, 2, and 3) from various bacterial systems with different specificities. 
The chimaeric containing-enzymes are composed of a catalytic module ( A, B, and 
C), each of which bears an appended dockerin module that binds specifically to the 
chimaeric scaffoldin. The catalytic modules may be from the same bacterium or 
from totally different species

 diversity and amplified numbers of catalytic subunits that can be 
incorporated into the system.
In this chapter, we describe methodologies to produce such 
intricate cellulosomal structures to improve the efficiency of carbo -
hydrate depolymerization. Additionally, we outline the methods 
used to isolate C. clariflavum  cellulosomes as an example of the 
technology that may be used for the purification of high-  molecular-  
weight natural cellulosomes. These artificial cellulosomes may be 
generated from a natural complex cellulosomal system, such as C. 
clariflavum,  or by constructing elaborate artificial cellulosomal 
assemblies. Regarding the production of natural cellulosomal com -
plexes, this chapter includes the conditions for proper fermenta -
tion of C. clariflavum , followed by the methodology for isolation 
and purification of the different cellulosomal fractions. For the 
production of elaborate designer cellulosomes, we provide meth -
ods for genetic engineering of the different chimaeric components 
and analysis of the resulting chimaeric proteins. Finally, strategies 
to probe the enzymatic activity of cellulosomes specialized in the 
degradation of different cellulosic substrates are detailed.

3 Methods
In nature, cellulosomes are produced by a restricted subset of 
anaerobic bacterial species that live in a variety of habitats under 
different environmental conditions [ 3, 17]. The structure and 
composition of cellulosomes varies within each bacterial species, 
and the number of enzymes in each complex is controlled by the 
molecular architecture of the scaffoldins that assemble the com -
plex. Cellulosomes are generally attached to the bacterial cell sur -
face [ 4, 18–21], although they may be released from the cell and 
function as cell-free complexes [ 10, 22].
The cellulosome of C. thermocellum  is recruited to the cell sur -
face, although the complex is released into the extracellular medium 
in the late stationary phase of growth. This facilitates the collection 
of these complexes and their further purification [ 4, 23]. 
Purification of cellulosomes can be performed using various 
approaches, depending on the properties required for their appli -
cation. These include gel filtration for high-molecular-weight 
complexes [ 10]; affinity-digestion for highly cellulolytic cellulo -
somes that adhere to cellulose and hydrolyze it efficiently [ 23, 24]; 
ion exchange chromatography [ 25] and ammonium sulfate pre -
cipitation [ 26].
In this chapter, we provide the methods used to isolate 
C. clariflavum  cellulosomes as an example of the technology that 
may be used for the purification of high-molecular-weight natural 
cellulosomes.
C. clariflavum  is a thermophilic bacterium that grows under 
strict anaerobic conditions. Bioinformatic and biochemical analy -
ses of its cellulosomal system revealed that it possesses one of the 
largest cellulosome complexes known up to date, comprising up to 
160 dockerin-bearing enzymes [ 9]. C. clariflavum  was cultivated 
for the subsequent isolation of different cellulosome complexes. 
Components of purified cellulosomes were characterized by mass 
spectrometry and the ability of native cellulosomes to degrade dif -
ferent substrates was evaluated.
 1. In order to produce large amounts of natural cellulosomes from 
C. clariflavum,  grow the bacteria in large scale (e.g., 10  L 
fermenter) under anaerobic conditions at 55  °C on GS-2 
medium. Make sure to sparge the medium with nitrogen during 
the entire fermentation process.
 2. Adjust the solution to pH  7.2 with 10  M NaOH.
 3. Add the desired carbon source. For example: 8  g/L cellobiose 
(Sigma-Aldrich), 2  g/L Avicel or 2  g/L acid-pretreated 
switchgrass to induce expression of genes associated with 
cellulosome production.3.1 Purification

 4. Grow the bacterium until late stationary phase.
 5. Assess growth phase by measuring optical density ( A600nm) at 
different time points when the substrate is soluble (cellobiose). 
Centrifuge the cells of each sample, and resuspend in 
TBS.  Extract 1  mL sample, and measure the optical density. 
When cells are grown on insoluble carbon sources, growth is 
measured by enzymatic activity of samples collected at differ -
ent time points on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC; VWR 
International Ltd., Poole, England).
 6. After cultivation, collect the spent growth medium, and remove 
cells by centrifugation at 13,690  × g for 15  min.
C. clariflavum  cellulosomes are predicted to have an exceptionally 
high molecular weight. Therefore, a separation method based on 
size exclusion is desirable.
 1. Concentrate the media supernatant fluids by 100-fold using a 
peristaltic pump (MasterFlex l/S pump system, Easy-Load II 
pump head [Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL]) with a 500-kDa-  
cutoff Pellicon 2 membrane (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).
 2. Separate the protein contents of the concentrated solution by 
preparative gel filtration chromatography, using a chromatogra -
phy system for laboratory-scale protein purification (Äkta start; 
GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Use a gel filtration column 
HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-500 HR (GE Healthcare, Little 
Chalfont , UK), with a separation range of 40  kDa to 20  MDa. 
Use TBS as the Running Buffer. Chromatographic separation 
of the proteins should result in the elution of two major high-  
molecular-  weight peaks, with a calculated molecular mass of ~ 
400 and ~ 1200  kDa, for each growth condition.
 3. Subject the different fractions comprising the two peaks to 
SDS-PAGE ( see Fig. 3 for an example of SDS-PAGE of the cel -
lulosome fractions).
The development of the designer cellulosome concept proceeded 
over a 2-decade period. The initial report in 1994 [ 11] led to con -
crete experimental attempts in 2001 [ 27], which were followed by 
the generation of monovalent [ 28, 29], then bivalent [ 30], triva -
lent [ 31, 32], tetravalent [ 33], and finally hexavalent scaffoldins 
[34], thereby enabling the self-assembly of more complex designer 
cellulosomal systems.
Two types of chimaeric enzymes can be incorporated into 
designer cellulosomes. For cellulosomal enzymes, the sequence of 
the dockerin region has to be identified and then artificially replaced 
using an appropriate molecular cloning strategy by the dockerin 
expressing the desired specificity. For non-cellulosomal enzymes, 
which usually contain a CBM module attached to their catalytic 3.1.2  Isolation

102
module, the CBM module can be either replaced or left intact, 
depending on the enzyme type. In both cases a dockerin of the 
desired specificity needs to be incorporated, usually at the 
C-terminus of the engineered protein. The catalytic activity of the 
resultant chimaeric enzymes has to be subsequently compared to 
that of the wild-type form, in order to ensure that by conversion to 
the cellulosomal mode or by replacing the dockerin module, cata -
lytic efficiency is not significantly affected.
Additional breakthroughs involved investigation of novel cellu -
losome geometries [ 35], inclusion of nonnative types of bacterial 
[28] and fungal cellulases [ 36] and oxidative enzymes [ 37] into 
designer cellulosome formats. Nevertheless, incorporation of addi -
tional cohesins to the hexavalent scaffoldin sequence eventually 
proved problematic, since the extended proteins were unstable, dif -
ficult to express using standard E. coli  molecular biological tools and 
due to the limited number of distinct well-characterized cohesin–
dockerin specificities available for cellulosome design. Increasing the 
number (and types) of enzymatic subunits integrated into designer

produced in cellobiose-, microcrystalline cellulose-, and switchgrass-containing 
growth media were concentrated and isolated by gel-filtration chromatography. 
For each carbon source, two peaks of cellulosome proteins were identified ( I and II), 
representing very high- and high-molecular-weight fractions, respectively.

cellulosome is, however, critical, in order to enhance degradation of 
plant cell wall residues and render future biotechnological applica -
tions cost-effective. Recently, an original strategy has been proposed 
for incorporating additional catalytic subunits into designer cellulo -
somes [ 13]. This approach involves the use of an adaptor scaffoldin: 
a chimaeric scaffoldin that is able to both incorporate enzymes and 
attach to an additional scaffoldin. Similar to the primary scaffoldin, 
the adaptor scaffoldin was found experimentally to require a CBM, 
in order to promote enhanced synergistic action on cellulosic 
 substrates [ 13].
In order to create an extended designer cellulosome, two separate 
chimaeric scaffoldins have to be designed: a primary or platform 
scaffoldin and an adaptor scaffoldin.
 1. Design of the primary scaffoldin. This type of scaffoldin is 
composed of several type I cohesins with different specificities 
for incorporation of the enzymes, a CBM, and a type II cohe -
sin for interaction with the adaptor scaffoldin.
 2. Design of the adaptor scaffoldin. An adaptor scaffoldin should 
comprise several type I cohesins, a CBM and a relevant type II 
dockerin to attach to the type II cohesin of the primary scaf -
foldin ( see Note 3 ).
 3. The chimaeric scaffoldins, i.e., primary (platform) and adaptor 
scaffoldins, used herein to exemplify this methodology, are 
represented in Fig. 4.
 4. The adaptor scaffoldin Scaf1  was obtained by integrating the 
following gene fragments—CBM3a (from CipA, C. thermocel -
lum) and cohesins A (third cohesin of ScaC from A. cellulolyti -
cus), B (third cohesin from ScaB, B. cellulosolvens ), and T (third 
cohesin from CipA, C. thermocellum ) culminating in the type 
II dockerin from the C. thermocellum  CipA scaffoldin.
 5. The primary (platform) scaffoldin Scaf2  was obtained by fusing 
a C. thermocellum  type II cohesin (from anchoring scaffoldin 
OlpB) to the following fragment: cohesins C (first cohesin of 
CipC, Clostridium cellulolyticum ) and A (third cohesin of ScaC 
from A. cellulolyticus ), CBM3a (from CipA, C. thermocellum ), 
cohesins T (third cohesin from CipA, C. thermocellum ), G 
(cohesin from Orf2375, Archaeoglobus fulgidus ), and F (first 
cohesin of ScaB, R. flavefaciens).
 6. The different modules were assembled using regular molecular 
biology cloning tools with restriction enzymes [ 38] in linearized 
pET28a plasmid to form the chimeric scaffoldin ( see Note 4 ).
 1. Transform BL21 cells and plate with antibiotic.

 3. Grow cells to A 600 nm ~1.
 4. Induction: Add 50  μL 1 M IPTG to a final concentration of 
0.1 or 1  mM ( see Note 5 ).
 5. Grow cells at 37  °C for 3  h, at 16  °C for 17  h, at 30  °C for 5  h, 
or at 16  °C overnight ( see Note 5 ).
 6. Centrifuge cells for 15  min at 4500  × g at 4 °C.
 7. Store pellet at −20 °C.
 1. Prepare Wash, Elution, and Neutralization buffers in advance 
(see Subheading 2.2.3 ).
 2. Resuspend pellet in 20  mL TBS + Protease Inhibitors.
 3. Sonication: put sample in ice bath and cool down for 10  min. 
Sonicate the cell suspension at 40% amplitude with five burst of 
30 s followed by intervals of 30  s for cooling (keep the suspen -
sion at all times on ice). Avoid foaming ( see Note 6 )
 4. Centrifuge for 30  min at 20,000  × g at 4 °C.
 1. Transfer supernatant to a new 50  mL tube and add 1  g of 
cellulose beads (IONTO-SORB, Czech Republic).

is the adaptor scaffoldin. The Scaf1 adaptor scaffoldin enables incorporation of 
three different chimaeric enzymes via its three divergent type I cohesins and 
interacts specifically via its type II dockerin with the type II cohesin of the major 
platform Scaf2, which incorporates five additional chimaeric enzymes via its 
five divergent type I cohesins. The resultant artificial cellulosome will thus be 
composed of a total of eight chimaeric enzymes

 3. Incubate for 1–2  h on the rotator at 4  °C.
 4. Centrifuge for 5  min at 4000  × g at 4  °C (Save supernatant 
fluids to examine by SDS-PAGE as unbound fraction).
 1. Wash pellet three times with 45  mL Wash Buffer #1 and three 
times with 45  mL TBS as follows.
(a) Rotate 5  min at room temperature.
(b) Centrifuge at 4000  × g for 5  min at 4  °C, and discard 
supernatant.
 1. Elute protein from pellet two times with 5–10  mL Elution Buffer.
 2. Rotate 5  min at room temperature.
 3. Centrifuge at 4000  × g for 5  min at 4  °C and save supernatant.
 4. Transfer supernatant to a new tube and neutralize with 
Neutralization Buffer.
Purity of the proteins is examined by SDS-PAGE.  Protein concen -
tration is estimated optically by measuring absorbance at 280  nm, 
based on the known amino acid composition of the protein using 
the Protparam tool [ 39]. Proteins are stored in 50% (v/v) glycerol 
at −20 °C (see Note 7 ).
 1. Prepare the different fractions containing the proteins of inter -
est with SDS-containing Sample Buffer at a minimum amount 
of 5 μg of sample. When the concentration is unknown 
(following purification or isolation of the complex from cellu -
losomal bacteria), insert the maximal volume of sample (usu -
ally the wells of the gel can be loaded with 30–60  μL).
 2. Prepare an SDS polyacrylamide gel at 6–20%, depending on the 
size of your protein/complex (10% for average sized proteins) 
by using the following two tables to prepare resolving and 
stacking gels.
(a) Resolving gel (Table 1).
(b) Stacking gel, 5  mL (Table 2).
 3. Boil the samples for 5  min at 100  °C.
 4. Perform electrophoresis for 45  min at 200  V.
The specificities of both dockerin- and cohesin-containing pro -
teins are examined semiquantitatively using affinity-based ELISA 
[15]. Each module must bind selectively with its matching partner 
and exhibit no or very poor binding to non-matching counter -
parts. In addition, in order to ensure that the adaptor scaffoldin is 
able to bind simultaneously to recombinant enzymes via its type I 
cohesin modules and to the primary scaffoldin via its type II dock -
erin module, a modified ELISA-based assay should be performed 
(Fig. 5; see Subheading 2.3.1  for preparation of reagents.Washing

poor interaction at very high concentrations. No signal was observed in the absence of adaptor scaffoldin

 2. Subsequent steps are performed at room temperature with all 
reagents at a volume of 100  μL/well.
 3. Discard Coating Solution.
 4. Add Blocking Buffer and incubate for 1  h.
 5. Discard Blocking Buffer.
 6. Interact with incremental concentrations (0.1–1000  ng/mL) 
of the adaptor scaffoldin in Blocking Buffer for 1  h.
 7. Wash three times with Wash Buffer #2.
 8. Samples are subjected to interaction with relevant Xyn-Docs at 
100 ng/mL in Blocking Buffer for 1  h.
 9. Plates are again washed three times.
 10. Interact with primary antibody solution in Blocking Buffer 
for 1  h.
 11. Wash three times with Wash Buffer.
 12. Interact with secondary antibody solution in Blocking Buffer 
for 1 h.
 13. Wash four times with Wash Buffer.
 14. Detection: Add 100  μL/well of TMB substrate-chromogen.
 15. Terminate reaction after 2–5  min with 50  μL/well 1  M H 2SO 4.
 16. Measure absorbance at 450  nm using a tunable microplate 
reader. Plot absorbance as a function of adaptor concentration 
(usually results in a sigmoidal curve).
To check the extent of the interaction and determine exact 
equimolar ratios between matching pairs of cohesin and dockerin 
in the recombinant proteins, a differential mobility assay using 
non- denaturing PAGE is used. The optimal interaction may form 
at ratios somewhat different from the estimated 1:1 ratio, mainly 
due to impurities of the proteins that interfere with the real estima -
tion of concentration. An example of two interacting chimaeric 
scaffoldins is provided in Fig. 6 (see Note 8 ; see Subheading 2.3.2 ).
 1. Prepare solutions containing the two interacting proteins 
(i.e., chimaeric enzyme-scaffoldin or adaptor-primary scaffoldin) 
at different estimated molar ratios usually from 0.4:1 to 1.6:1 
(1:1 ratio is about 4–8  μg) in Dilution Buffer in a total volume 
of 30  μL.
 2. Incubate the tubes for 2  h at 37  °C.
 3. Add 7.5  μL ND-Sample Buffer to 15  μL of the reaction 
mixture.
 4. Load the samples onto non-denaturing gels. The stacking gel 
is prepared at 3.5% or 4.3%; the separating gel can be prepared 
at 6–15% ( see Note 9 ).
 5. Run the gel for a minimum of 2  h at 100  V to evaluate enzyme-  
scaffoldin combinations. To analyze interactions between the 3.3.2  Non-  denaturing 
PAGE
Carbohydrate Depolymerization by Cellulosomes
108
adaptor and primary/platform scaffoldins, electrophoresis 
should proceed for a minimum of 3  h but not exceeding that.
 6. When both proteins are combined at the exact stoichiometric 
ratio, a single major band with altered mobility is usually 
observed.
In order to ensure that the designer cellulosome complex resulting 
from the binding of a chimaeric scaffoldin to several enzymes is 
indeed formed at exact equimolar ratios but also has the ability to 
strongly bind to the cellulosic substrate via the resident CBM, an 
affinity pull-down assay should be performed (Fig. 7). This approach 
will also show that the enzymes are indeed contained in the complex 
and not in the free form, i.e., released from the complex.
 1. Prepare equimolar amounts of pure proteins (100  pmol each) 
in a final volume of 300  μL of Reaction Buffer ( see Subheading 
2.4.1 ).
 2. Incubate samples for 2  h at 37  °C in a solution of 10% 
Cellobiose (Sigma-Aldrich) ( see Note 10 ).
 3. Gently mix the fractions with 30  mg of microcrystalline cellulose 
(Avicel, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1  h at 4  °C.
 4. Centrifuge at 16,000  × g for 2  min.3.3.3  Affinity 
Pull-Down  Assay
Fig. 6  Non-denaturing PAGE for determining stoichiometry of interaction between the adaptor scaffoldin Scaf1 
and the primary platform scaffoldin Scaf2 . Lanes 1 –7 correspond to complexes of the two scaffoldins at 
different ratios. Lane 8  corresponds to Scaf1 alone, and lane 9  corresponds to Scaf2 alone (100  pmol each). 
For all gels, the amount of Scaf2 was fixed at 100  pmol, and the amount of Scaf1 was adjusted according to 
the specified molar ratios. Here the exact equimolar ratio is reached in lane 3 , equivalent to a 0.8:1 ratio 
according to initial estimates of concentration. At this ratio, both bands representing the two chimaeric scaf -
foldin have disappeared. Only the high heavy band representing the complex of the two can be observed. At 
lower ratios, Scaf2 is in excess, and at higher ratios, the excess Scaf1 band begins to appear
Johanna Stern et al.
109
 5. Carefully remove supernatant fluids (containing unbound 
proteins) and add SDS-Sample Buffer ( see Subheading 2.2.3 ) 
to a final volume of 60  μL.
 6. Wash pellets (containing bound proteins) twice by resuspension 
in 200  μL of Wash Buffer #3 to eliminate nonspecific binding.
 7. Centrifuge the washed pellets at 16,000  × g for 2  min, and 
suspend in 60  μL of SDS-Sample Buffer ( see Subheading 
2.2.3 ).
 8. Boil both resultant unbound and bound fractions for 10  min 
and analyze by SDS-PAGE ( see Subheading 3.2.4 ).
For assembly of designer cellulosome systems containing an adaptor 
scaffoldin, each scaffoldin is allowed to interact separately with the 
predetermined ratio of its respective enzymes. Once complexes 
are formed, the two scaffoldins (laden with enzymes) are mixed 
together, thereby initiating self-assembly, and subjected to addi -
tional interaction as described in the following3.3.4  Assembly 
of Extended Designer 
Cellulosome
Fig. 7  Affinity pull-down assay . The three chimaeric enzymes and the adaptor scaffoldin Scaf1 were first 
assayed individually for binding to a cellulosic substrate. They were then mixed together at equimolar ratios and 
subsequently introduced to a cellulosic substrate (Avicel). The cellulose-binding ability of both individual 
proteins and the resultant complex was determined by examining the cellulose-unbound ( lanes 2–6 ) versus 
cellulose-bound ( lanes 7–11 ) fractions by SDS-PAGE.  Samples include: lane 1  and 12, molecular weight mark -
ers. Lane 2 –6, unbound fractions with the following details: lane 2 –4, three different chimaeric enzymes; 
lane 5 , the adaptor scaffoldin Scaf1; lane 6 , complex of the three enzymes and Scaf1. Lanes 7 –11 are bound 
fractions: lanes 7–9 , three different chimaeric enzymes; lane 10 , Scaf1; lane 11 , complex of the three enzymes 
and Scaf1. In the presence of the chimaeric scaffoldin, the enzymatic components were associated with the 
cellulose-  bound fraction, whereas in its absence they remained in the unbound fraction. In the example shown, 
Scaf1 and Enzymes A and B have similar molecular weights and are hard to distinguish individually in complex 
on the gel. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Sca1-complexed enzymes are all bound to the cellulosic matrix

 1. For each cellulosomal components, calculate the relevant 
amount of protein based on the absorbance measurement at 
OD 280nm and/or adjustment of equimolar ratios following 
nondenaturing PAGE ( see Subheading 3.3.2 ).
 2. For a final reaction volume of 200  μL (for enzymatic assay), 
introduce the relevant amounts of each chimaeric scaffoldin 
and corresponding enzymes into two separate reaction tubes 
with 30  μL of Wash Buffer #2 ( see Subheading 2.3.1 ).
 3. Incubate the reaction tubes for 2  h at 37  °C (in the absence of 
the substrate).
 4. Mix the previously described reaction tubes into a new single 
reaction tube and incubate it for 2 additional hours at 37  °C 
(in the absence of the substrate).
The conditions for the enzyme assays of the complexed cellulo -
somal components have to be optimized, such as concentration, 
pH, and temperature. In addition, the linear range of activity 
exhibited by the native or chimaeric enzymatic cocktails also has to 
be calibrated [ 40]. The optimal substrates for cellulosomal activity 
are cellulosic substrates (as PASC and Avicel) or lignocellulosic 
ones (such as switchgrass or wheat straw) [ 32].
A typical example of proximity with or without targeting effect 
is illustrated in Fig. 8 [13]. The targeting effect can be deduced by 
the increased degradation profile of the CBM-restored enzymes in 
comparison with the free dockerin-bearing enzymes. While 
Adaptor1 provides an additional proximity effect by virtue of its 
resident CBM (i.e., higher degradation than CBM-restored 
enzymes), Adaptor2 (with an added external CBM) provides only 
a proximity effect among the enzymes, since the observed degra -
dation is higher than that of the free enzymes but lower than the 
CBM-restored enzyme. In addition, the benefit of proximity 
between two chimaeric scaffoldins is also exemplified in Fig. 9: 
only the cellulosomal system with two attached chimaeric scaf -
foldins ultimately provides an advantage over the wild-type enzyme 
mixture. While these effects can be readily deduced using designer 
cellulosomes [ 40], precise interpretation of the data is problematic 
using natural cellulosomal extracts, since cellulosome composition 
is not controlled, even if mass spectrometric analysis is used for 
their analysis [ 10].
The enzymatic concentration in designer cellulosomes 
depends on the cellulosic substrate, and the temperature of the 
reaction depends on the origin of the enzyme(s) used ( see Note 
11). After termination of the reaction, samples are centrifuged at 
maximum speed to remove intact substrate, and the amount of 
reducing sugars can be determined using DNS assay or high-per -
formance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC), as previously 
described [ 40].3.4 Enzyme

4 Notes
 1. Concentrated HCl (12  N) can initially be used, followed by 
reduced concentrations of lower strengths.
 2. When working with cellulosomal components, a stock solu -
tion of 2  M CaCl 2 should always be available. The calcium 
solution will be used for numerous manipulations since the 
dockerin/cohesin binding event is calcium-dependent.
 3. The arrangement of the different modules composing the two 
chimaeric scaffoldins must be considered [ 38] as well as the 
length of linkers between them [ 39].
 4. Cloning of large chimaeric scaffoldins may be quite challenging 
in pET28a plasmids. Indeed, the insert almost doubles the size 
of the vector. Particularly, high concentrations of insert versus 
vector (about 10–1) should be used allowing the ligation 
reactions to last for longer periods (at least 1 day).
 5. In order to examine the preferred conditions for expression of 
the desired protein, the final concentration of IPTG, the tem -
perature and the period of incubation can be adjusted at the 
indicated values. An optimization step composed of low-scale 
growths with the different parameters can be performed in 
order to determine the optimal conditions.
 6. Do not leave while the sonicator is in operation. It is possible 
that the beaker breaks or turns in the melting ice.
 7. Determination of the scaffoldin concentration according to the 
absorbance at 280  nm should be taken with care. The effective 
stoichiometry of components must be readjusted using non-
denaturing PAGE mobility assay, as the scaffoldin contains very 
few tryptophans, and hence has a particularly low extinction 
coefficient.
 8. When performing non-denaturing gel electrophoresis in the 
presence of an adaptor scaffoldin, i.e., a recombinant cohesin-  
bearing protein that also contains a type II dockerin, the forma -
tion of homodimers via the type II dockerin may be observed 
[41] which may be confusing. Only at the optimal molecular 
ratio (1:1) between the type II dockerin and the matching type 
II cohesin will the homodimer not be observed.
 9. As the assembled complex is more important than the compo -
nent parts, the percentage of the gel should be lower to accom -
modate the high-molecular-weight material.
Carbohydrate Depolymerization by Cellulosomes

 10. Cellobiose binds to the catalytic module of the enzymes, thus 
blocking potential weak binding to the cellulosic substrate.
 11. The enzymatic concentration in designer cellulosomes for the 
degradation of recalcitrant substrate should be: for cellulosic 
materials, like PASC and Avicel, in the range of 0.1–2  μM of 
total enzymatic concentration, and for crude natural substrates, 
like switchgrass and wheat straw, in the range of 0.3–5  μM. 
In contrast, for degradation of simple purified substrates, such as 
CMC and xylan, the enzymatic concentration should be in a 
range of 0.1–1  nM. The required concentration of natural 
cellulosome extracts should be ~25  μg/mL.  The temperature of 
incubation should correspond to the species from which the 
chimaeric enzymes originate (for designer cellulosomes) or from 
the species of the purified natural cellulosomes (i.e., from meso -
philic or thermophilic bacteria).
 12. In order to convert the OD measurements at 540  nm to 
amount of released sugars, a standard curve of known amount 
of glucose (0.5–5  mM) should be prepared and subjected to 
DNS analysis in the same time.

Affinity Electrophoresis for  Analysis of  Catalytic  
Module-  Carbohydrate Interactions
Darrell  Cockburn, Casper  Wilkens, and  Birte  Svensson
Abstract
Affinity electrophoresis has long been used to study the interaction between proteins and large soluble 
ligands. The technique has been found to have great utility for the examination of polysaccharide binding 
by proteins, particularly carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). In recent years, carbohydrate surface 
binding sites of proteins mostly enzymes have also been investigated by this method. Here, we describe a 
protocol for identifying binding interactions between enzyme catalytic modules and a variety of carbohydrate 
ligands.
Key words Affinity electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Polysaccharide, Surface binding 
site, Carbohydrate binding module, Dissociation constant
1 Introduction
Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) has been used 
for many years when electrophoretic analyses are required of proteins 
in their folded state, such as to monitor complex formation or 
enzyme activity. Affinity electrophoresis is the use of Native PAGE 
with a potential polysaccharide ligand embedded in the acrylamide 
matrix. Proteins that bind the ligand migrate more slowly than 
they do in native gel control. Interactions with ligands result in a 
gel shift, which is a similar effect to what is observed with DNA 
binding protein gel shift assays [ 1, 2]. Affinity gel electrophoresis 
(AGE) has seen use as a tool for detecting and visualizing the inter -
actions between proteins and carbohydrates, often in the context 
of CBM binding [ 3–6]. Surface binding sites are ligand binding 
sites situated on the catalytic module of the enzyme, but distant 
from the active site, and have also been studied by affinity electro -
phoresis [ 7–11]. The mostly larger size of these non-truncated 
enzymes adds some additional challenges as compared to working 
with just CBMs; however, it is feasible with some optimization. 
120
Here, we present a method for performing AGE with non-  truncated 
enzymes, particularly those that lack CBMs, and a variety of potential 
polysaccharide ligands.

containing gels and a set of control gels with desired percent -
age of acrylamide. These recipes are sufficient for making two 
gels. Add water, polysaccharide (replace with additional water 
for control gels), running buffer, and acrylamide to a 50  mL 
conical tube. Mix by gentle swirling or inversion.
 2. Add TEMED and APS to initiate polymerization and then 
gently swirl or invert again. Using a transfer pipette, slowly add 2.2 Native PAGE Gels

the gel solution to the cassette, leaving a 2.5  cm gap to the top 
of the gel cassette. Add a thin layer of isopropanol to remove 
bubbles and smoothen the surface. Allow approximately 
30 min to 1  h for polymerization to occur.
 3. Pour off isopropanol layer and rinse with water.
 4. Make stacking gel, by adding 3.5  mL water, 1  mL running 
buffer, and 0.5  mL acrylamide to a 50  mL conical tube. Mix by 
gentle swirling or inversion.
 5. Add 10  μL TEMED and 75  μL APS.  Mix by gentle swirling or 
inversion. Use a transfer pipette to fill the remainder of the gel 
cassette with the stacking gel solution. Be careful to avoid intro -
duction of bubbles, add a gel comb with the desired number of 
wells. Allow polymerization to occur for approximately 45  min.
 6. Gels can be kept for up to 1 week if covered with wet paper 
towels and plastic wrap, storing at 4  °C.
 1. Place one polysaccharide gel and a control gel of the same 
acrylamide concentration into a gel chamber, removing the 
sticker at the bottom of the gel, with the gel combs facing 
toward the middle of the well formed by the two gels.
 2. Fill this middle well with 1× running buffer and remove the

 3. Add 5  μL of the control protein or ladder to the first well. Add 
experimental proteins to each of the additional wells. Different 
load levels can be tried as some proteins run in tighter bands 
than others. At 0.5–1  mg/mL, 5–10  μL is recommended.
 4. Run at a constant voltage. Voltage and time may need to be 
optimized for the specific protein ( see Note 2 ). Examples include 
75 V for 6  h for 100  kDa protein, p I of 6.0 on a 6% gel, or 75  V 
for 2 h for a 30  kDa protein with p I 4.0 on a 12% gel.3.2 Running GelsTable 1

 2. Place in a small container and cover with staining solution. 
Incubate 1–2  h at room temperature with gentle shaking.
 3. Remove staining solution (dispose of in proper chemical waste,

 1. Open the gel in ImageJ (download from: https://imagej.nih.
gov/ij/ ).
 2. Using the measurement function, measure the distance from 
the top of the separating gel to the band for each reference and 
sample protein for both the control and polysaccharide con -
taining gels ( see Fig. 1).
 3. Divide the migration distance in the polysaccharide gel by the 
migration distance in the control gel for each protein to get 
the migration distance ratio (MDR).
 4. For each sample protein divide its MDR by the MDR of the 
reference protein to get the Normalized MDR.
 5. If the Normalized MDR is less than 1 ( see Note 3 ) the protein 
is binding to the polysaccharide.
Besides being used as a qualitative method to screen for potential 
ligands, AGE can also be used quantitatively to estimate binding con -
stants for the enzymes by using a range of polysaccharide concentra -
tions. The original equation (Eq. 1) developed by Takeo and Nakamura 
[12] assumes that there is a linear relationship between the concentra -
tion of the ligand and the mobility of the enzyme from which the 
apparent dissociation constants ( KD,app) can be determined:

Rmi and Rmo are migration distances of sample relative to refer -
ence protein in the presence and the absence of polysaccharide, 
respectively; c is the polysaccharide concentration. Thus, the 
inverse relative migration distances (1/ Rmi) plotted as a function of 
c yield 1/ KD, app as the negative x-axis intercept of the straight line 
in a Takeo-Nakamura plot [ 12]. Later, as demonstrated by Tomme 
et al. [2] with CBMs the linearization is unnecessary to obtain

problematic in studies where either or both the amount of enzyme 
and the ligand are limiting. Tomme et  al. [5] showed that the data 
for the CBMs can be plotted with the relative migration ( Rm) (Rm 
= Rmo − Rmi) of the enzyme as a function of c to the general rect -

4 Notes
 1. There are five factors that will determine how quickly a protein 
will run in a Native PAGE gel: protein molecular weight, protein 
shape, protein p I, gel pore size, and voltage. Additionally, we can 
control how long the gel is run for. Often we will not have much 
information about protein shape and so we assume that it is 
roughly spherical. Of the remaining factors we can most easily 
match up gel pore size (directly related to % acryclamide) and 
protein molecular weight. For proteins less than 20  kDa, use 14% 
acrylamide, for 20–40  kDa, use 12%, for 40–60  kDa use 10%, for 
60–80  kDa use 8%, for >80  KDa use 6% kDa.
 2. As described for protein molecular weight and gel pore size in 
Note 1 , protein p I can best be adjusted for with the voltage 
and time. Generally, we shall want the protein to migrate rela -
tively close to the bottom of the gel (though not run off) in 
the control gel so that we can easily see the difference if there 
is a mobility shift in the polysaccharide containing gel. The pH 
of the buffer in the described system is 8.7. The further the p I 
of the protein is below this, the quicker it will run. Protein 
migration scales linearly with both voltage and time, so we can 
use the measurement volt-hours to describe how to run the gel 
(e.g., 100  V for 1  h is 100  V-h). For p I < 4.5 use 150  V-h, for 
4.5 < pI < 5.5 use 300  V-h, for 5.5  < pI < 6.5, use 450  V-h, for 
6.5 < pI <7.5 use 600  V-h. For p I > 7.5 another buffer system 
will need to be used ( see McLellan [ 13]). It is also possible to 
switch the electrodes on your gel system to allow migration of 
proteins with p I above the pH of the gel buffer. While protein 
migration is determined by V-h, there are certain voltage 
restrictions. Lower percentage gels are more sensitive to the 
heat generated at higher voltages, which may alter pore size or 
even result in gel failure. It is not recommended to exceed 
100 V for gels 8% or less or 120  V for gels >8%.
 3. Whether a value less than one is significant can be determined 
through replication. However, generally, the cutoff for accept -
ing the shift as representative of binding needs to take into 
account the width of the band (can sometimes be large in Native 
PAGE). Thus, the difference in migration distance between the 
control and polysaccharide gel should be greater than the band 
thickness to be considered positive for binding.

Quantifying CBM Carbohydrate Interactions Using 
Microscale Thermophoresis
Haiyang  Wu, Cédric  Y. Montanier, and  Claire  Dumon
Abstract
MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is an emerging technology for studying a broad range of biomolecular 
interactions with high sensitivity. The affinity constant can be obtained for a wide range of molecules 
within minutes based on reactions in microliters. Here, we describe the application of MST in quantifying 
two CBM-carbohydrate interactions, a CBM3a toward cellulose nanocrystals and a CBM4 against 
xylohexaose.
Key words Microscale thermophoresis (MST), Binding studies, Fluorescence quenching, Fluorescent 
label, Kd (dissociation constant)
1 Introduction
Protein-carbohydrate interactions are involved in a myriad of 
important biological functions. Therefore, many techniques are 
used to quantify and characterize those interactions, such as 
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) that allows characteriza -
tion of thermodynamics during interaction process, Affinity Gel 
Electrophoresis (AGE) using soluble polysaccharides, solid-state 
depletion assay using insoluble polysaccharides, UV difference, 
and fluorescence spectroscopy [ 1].
Thermophoresis, or thermodiffusion/Soret effect, was first 
described by Carl Ludwig in 1856. This technique uncovered the 
different responses of particles in a mobile phase toward a gradient 
of temperature. The miniaturized thermophoresis, namely MST, 
was developed in the last decade to monitor the interactions and 
calculate the thermodynamic constants among biomolecules rang -
ing in size from 101 to 107 Da in only few microliters. The descrip -
tion of thermophoresis in a frame of a local thermodynamic 
equilibrium allows one to quantify the thermophoretic behavior 
based on the charge, size, and hydration shell of biomolecules [ 2, 3]. 
Basically, the MST instrument contains an infra-red (IR) laser that 
130
induces a microscopic temperature gradient (e.g., 1°K/10  μm) in 
a glass capillary, a high-power LED (light-emitting diode) as a 
source of light excitation, a fluorescence detector, and a sample 
tray of 16 capillaries [ 4, 5]. Briefly, the labeled molecule is mixed 
with a decreasing concentration of non-fluorescent ligand and each 
mixture is loaded into one of the 16 glass capillaries. Initial fluores -
cence is measured as a base line in each capillary and the IR laser is 
switched on. The IR laser beam is focused onto the mid-point of 
capillary and strongly absorbed by aqueous solution resulting in a 
temperature gradient from the laser spot to the outer region. 
Simultaneously, a dichroic mirror allows fluorescence from labeled 
molecule to be continuously monitored, while complexes migrate 
in the capillaries. The fluorescence in the laser spot area decreases 
or increases during thermophoresis, at a velocity related to the 
concentration of ligand, due to change in size, charge, or hydra -
tion shell of the complex. Each capillary is scanned in minutes one 
after another. The constant of dissociation Kd is deduced from the 
binding curve derived by plotting the normalized fluorescence 
(FNorm) at a given time against each ligand concentration ( L) [3, 5].
Depending on the molecule investigated, the source of fluo -
rescence could be intrinsic (e.g., indole side chain of tryptophan), 
coming from attached dyes (e.g., Fluorescein, Alexa546) or from 
fluorescent protein (e.g., GFP, YFP). The fluorescence excitation/
detection spectrum range would lead to choose appropriate appa -
ratus. Several labeling strategies could be employed to target pro -
teins by attaching, for instance, specific fluorophore molecule to 
the ε-amine group of lysine, thiol group of cysteine, fusion protein 
(such as GFP), or even unnatural amino acids.
Here, we present the use of the MST for the quantification of 
CBM/ligand interactions. The CBMs used in our protocol are the 
CBM3a from Clostridium Thermocellum  [6] and a newly identified 
CBM4 from termite gut microbiota [ 7]. They display affinity for 
insoluble crystalline cellulose and soluble xylan respectively. Both 
CBMs were labeled to primary amine group of lysine using an 
adapted protocol from the protein labeling kit provided by 
NanoTemper and then MST experiments were performed using 
Monolith NT.115 instrument.

3 Methods
Protein Labeling Kit RED-NHS protocol was used to label our CBMs 
(http://www.helsinki.fi/biosciences/corefacilities/microscalether -
mophoresis/Protein_Labeling_Manual_V012-  RED-  NHS.pdf ). 
Procedure for purification of labeled CBMs was modified as our 
CBMs displayed affinity for the resin of the desalting column 
provided in the kit ( see Note 4 ).
 1. As our CBMs were already in 50  mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 
the buffer exchange step was not necessary ( see Note 2 ).
 2. Protein concentration was adjusted to 20  μM in 100  μL in the 
labeling buffer ( see Note 10 ). The original concentration of 
protein is determined by measuring the absorbance at 280  nm 
and calculated according to the Beer-Lambert Law using theo -
retical extinction coefficient determined by protparam tool on 
expasy website ( http://web.expasy.org/protparam/ ) [10].
 3. According to the protocol of the manufacturer, the solid fluo -
rescent dye concentration was set to approx. 435  μM by adding 
30 μL of DMSO into the solid dye, and vigorously vortex until 
complete dissolution ( see Note 11 ).
 4. 15 μL of dye was added to 85  μL of labeling buffer to reach 
3.2-fold concentration of the protein ( see Note 12 ).
 5. Mix 100  μL of protein to 100  μL of dye and incubate 1  h at 
room temperature, protected from light by aluminum foil. 
Then, place labeled protein on ice.
We changed protocol from Step C of Labeling Kit 
protocol.
 6. Add 100  μL of TALON® Metal Affinity Resin into the Vivapure 
Metal Chelate Mini spin column, centrifuge at 1500  RCF

 7. Wash the resin with 500  μL of ice cold dH 2O, leave caps open 
(see Note 13 ), centrifuge as described in step 6 , and discard 
the flow through.
 8. Equilibrate the resin with 400  μL of ice cold labeling buffer, 
centrifuge as described in step 6 , and discard the flow through. 
Repeat this step three times.
 9. Load 200  μL of labeled protein ( see step 5 ) to the center of the 
column. Gently mix the protein-dye mixture with resin by 
shaking and incubate on ice for 15  min. Centrifuge as described 
in step 6  to remove excess of free dye.
 10. Wash with 400  μL of ice cold labeling buffer, centrifuge as 
described in step 6 , and discard the flow through. Repeat this 
step two times.
 11. Add 200  μL of ice cold elution buffer, resuspend gently the 
resin by shaking and incubate on ice for 5  min. Centrifuge at 
1500  RCF 3  min at 10  °C; collect the flow through as the 
labeled protein solution #1. Repeat one time and collect the 
flow through as labeled protein solution #2.
 12. Assess the concentration of the labeled protein by SDS-  PAGE 
(see Note 1 ).
Before setting up an assay, determining the optimized condition is 
required. Regarding this, the starting guide NT115 was followed: 
(http://www.helsinki.fi/biosciences/corefacilities/microscale -
thermophoresis/StartingGuide_NT115.pdf ). Briefly, the concen -
tration of labeled protein is adjusted to reach an initial fluorescence 
count between 500 and 1500. Different types of capillary and 
additives such as BSA, Tween 20, or Pluronic® F-127 have to be 
tested to avoid sample aggregation or adsorption to the inner sur -
face of capillary. Using Tween 20 will also result in an increasing 
of the sample fluorescence. Buffer composition may also influence 
fluorescence. Proper experimental condition will result in a sym -
metrical fluorescence peak ( see Note 14 ).
 1. The ligands, buffers, and all the additives used in the assay are 
scanned with LED power 60% to make sure there is no back -
ground fluorescence.
 2. Premium capillaries were used for both CBM3a and CBM4, 
and Pluronic® F-127 was used at a final concentration of 0.05% 
in the dilution buffer to avoid severe adsorption to the surface 
of the capillaries ( see Note 14 ).
 3. To obtain an initial fluorescence count between 500 and 1500 
while fixing LED power to 60%, MST power to 20%, CBM3a 
and CBM4 were diluted to 4.3  × 10−4 g/L and 0.057  μM 
respectively with dilution buffer containing Pluronic® F-127 
(0.05% final) ( see Note 15 ).3.2 Assay

 4. The highest concentration of the ligand in the reaction should 
be 20-fold above the expected Kd, but not below 100  nM (the 
lowest Kd that can be detected by NT.115 is 1  nM). For 
CBM3a, the highest concentration of cellulose nanocrystals 
was 10  g/L.  For CBM4, the highest concentration of xylo -
hexaose was 150  mM ( see Note 16 ). Both ligands were diluted 
using the dilution buffer.
 1. A titration series of 16 dilutions of the ligand is prepared in 
0.2 mL PCR tubes. Transfer 20  μL of the highest ligand con -
centration into vial 1 ( see Note 16 ), then proceed to cascade 
dilution as follows: add 10  μL of dilution buffer into vial 2 to 
vial 16. Transfer 10  μL from vial 1 to vial 2, mix by pipetting 
up and down three times ( see Note 17) . Then transfer 10  μL 
from vial 2 to 3. Repeat this step successively for all vials. 
Remove 10  μL from vial 16 after mixing to end up with 10  μL 
final.
 2. Prepare 2× stock solution of labeled protein ( see Note 18) . 
CBM3a and CBM4 were diluted to 8.6  × 10−4 g/L and 
0.114  μM respectively with dilution buffer and Pluronic® 
F-127 (0.1% final). Add 10  μL of protein stock to each vial of 
the dilution series ( see Note 19 ). Mix by pipetting up and 
down three times.
 3. Fill capillaries by sticking the capillary horizontally into the 
reaction tube to aspirate the sample ( see Note 20 ). The capil -
lary containing the highest ligand concentration is placed in 
the front of the sample tray.
 4. Place the sample tray in the instrument and perform the scan 
with the MO.  Control software ( see Note 21 ).
 1. After performing the capillary scan and MST experiment, the 
initial fluorescence intensity was checked (Fig. 1a). The varia -
tion of fluorescence is less than ±10% and the MST signal could 
be analyzed ( see Note 22 ).
 2. Select the tab “MST Analysis Set” in the MO.Affinity Analysis 
software. The fluorescence ratio before and after switching on 
the laser is calculated and plotted against the ligand concentra -
tion. A sigmoidal dose-response curve is obtained ( see Note 
23). Choose Kd model, enter the concentration of CBM3a in 
the same unit used as for the ligand.
 3. Choose the ∆FNorm as y-axis (Fig. 1b). The sigmoidal curve needs 
to have (a) a clear baseline and a clear saturation (at least three 
points respectively), (b) an amplitude/noise >3 ( see Note 24 ).

experiments that have been done in the exact same conditions 
into the same analysis set, and errors bars will automatically 
appear in the dose-response curve.
 5. The Kd of CBM3a toward cellulose nanocrystals deduced 
from the binding curve is 0.24  ± 0.05 g/L.  Regarding the 
complexity of cellulose nanocrystals, Kd would be considered 
as an apparent Kd.
 1. The initial fluorescence shown in Fig. 2a displays a typical 
quenching sigmoidal curve not compatible with proper MST 
experiment. In such a case, it is recommended to perform a 
SDS-denaturation Test or SD test to investigate if the quench -
ing comes from nonspecific interactions with the ligand and 
the fluorophore, nonspecific adsorption to tube walls, protein 
aggregation, or a binding event where the fluorophore is in 
close vicinity to the binding site ( see Note 25 ). To perform a 
SD Test, the samples 1–3 and 14–16 from the 16 reaction 
series are centrifuged 10  min at maximum speed to avoid sam -
ple adsorption to the tube walls. An aliquot of 10  μL of SD mix 
is added to each sample and well mixed by pipetting up and 
down three times. The mixture is incubated for 5  min at 95  °C 
and centrifuge briefly to denature the protein. The fluores -
cence intensity of each sample is measured after filling capillar -
ies (see Note 26 ). In our case, protein denaturation leads to 
restore uniform fluorescence intensity in all capillaries, mean -
ing that the variation of fluorescence was induced by a binding 
event. Select the tab “Initial Fluorescence Analysis Set” in the 
MO.Affinity Analysis software, select the raw data and then 
move to “Dose Response Fit.” Choose Kd Model, fix the con -
centration of CBM4, a sigmoid curve is derived and well fitted 
to the data.
 2. Choose ∆Raw fluorescence [counts] as y-axis, and then the 
dose-response curve appears showing that the fluorescence 
intensity decreases with increasing concentrations of the ligand 
(Fig. 2b). The sigmoidal curve needs to have (a) a clear base -
line and a clear saturation (at least three points respectively), 
(b) an amplitude/noise >3 ( see Note 24 ).
 3. The Kd of CBM4 toward xylohexaose derived from the bind -
ing curve was 2.5  ± 0.3 mM.
The two proteins were labeled on the lysine. However unlike 
CBM3a binding site (Fig. 1c) quenching fluorescence within 
CBM4 could be explained by the presence of a putative labeled 
lysine close to the binding site (Fig. 2c).3.4.2  CBM4

4 Notes
 1. After purifying the protein by IMAC, determining the protein 
concentration was not possible by UV absorption because of 
imidazole. In this case, to avoid dialysis dilution, we performed 
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE) with labeled protein and a serial dilution of pro -
tein (CBM3a or CBM4) as standards, and then quantified the 
labeled protein using the quantifying tool in the software of 
Image Lab 5.2.1.
 2. The buffer of the labeling kit is an amine-free buffer at pH 8. 
Our protein storage buffer was 50  mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0. 
It is also an amine-free buffer. Labeling efficiency using NHS-
ester group is optimal at pH 8 but could also be performed at 
pH 7, not below. The Na 2HPO 4·12H 2O can be dissolved faster 
if the dH 2O is warmed up to about 50  °C. If the binding event is 
calcium dependent, HEPES buffer is recommended instead of 
the phosphate buffer.

 3. Dealing with costly ligand such as xylohexaose, it is better to 
start with a rather high concentration (in our case 150  mM) 
for the very first trial before knowing the Kd to make sure the 
CBM can be saturated.
 4. The Gravity Flow Column B for purification provided in 
Monolith NT™ Protein Labeling Kit is a dextran-based gel 
filtration column. CBM3a and CBM4 displayed affinity for 
dextran, and were retained by the desalting column. Therefore, 
vivapure metal chelate mini spin columns were selected because 
they are made with a cellulose-free-based membrane. 
Furthermore, it allows the use of small volume of IMAC resins 
in the purification step.
 5. The TALON Metal Affinity Resin is made with Sepharose 
CL-6B, an agarose-based polysaccharide polymer material, 
which has no affinity with the CBMs studied.
 6. There are three different types of capillaries for NT.115, stan -
dard treated capillaries, hydrophobic capillaries, and premium 
coated capillaries. The premium coated one is the best to tackle 
with samples that have significant adsorption to surfaces, 
although it is the most expensive. We recommend trying with 
the standard treated capillaries first using buffer supplemented 
with additives such as BSA or detergent if the protein sticks to 
the inner surfaces of the capillary. If the adsorption is still a 
problem, then try with other capillaries.
 7. 20 μL of each sample is usually prepared for MST experiment; 
thus, a 0.2  mL individual tube is enough. Bigger reaction 
tubes are not recommended since the large surface area to 
volume ratio can increase adsorption to the tube wall and loss 
of protein. Besides, the 0.2  mL strip tubes are also recom -
mended for their convenient manipulation, especially in the 
serial dilution step.
 8. A red channel is always recommended as it allows measuring in 
complex bioliquids (cell lysate, serum) and no autofluorescence 
of a molecule in this channel has been observed.
 9. A refrigerated and temperature-regulated centrifuge is recom -
mended for the centrifuge of protein samples to maintain their 
stability.
 10. We recommend preparing a little bit more than 100  μL 
(e.g., 120  μL) for accurate pipetting afterward.
 11. It is possible to aliquot dye in DMSO and store at −20 °C.
 12. In our case, as the pH of the labeling buffer is not optimal we 
used a higher concentration of dye to improve the labeling 
efficiency that was 3.2-fold of the protein concentration.
 13. The maximum volume of the column is 600  μL, and adding 
500 μL of dH 2O into the column does not leave space for the air. 
Microscale Thermophoresis 
140
Therefore, leaving the cap open is recommended to ensure 
that the wash buffer is completely removed.
 14. Buffers containing detergent (0.05% pluronic acid, 0.05% 
tween-20), BSA (0.05–0.5  mg/mL), casein, and others can be 
tested. A modified pH or ionic strength can also improve the 
performance. In the case of binding-event induced quenching 
such as CBM4, BSA should be avoided because the quenching 
is resumed after adding BSA
 15. Concentration of the CBM3a was expressed in g/L to be in 
accordance with the unit of its substrate concentration, cellulose 
nanocrystals.
 16. The highest concentration of xylohexaose in the reaction is 
150 mM; therefore, 300  mM stock solution is required as the 
ligand will be diluted twice when adding the same volume of 
protein.
 17. Vortex will result in a possible adsorption of protein to the 
inner wall of the tube and considering the very low concentra -
tion of protein, even small adsorption would result in a signifi -
cant decreasing of protein concentration and so to a 
non-optimal assay.
 18. The protein and buffer additives will be diluted twice after 
mixing with the same volume of ligand; keep this in mind 
when designing the experiment.
 19. Stock solution of both protein and ligand required to be cen -
trifuged at full speed 5  min before mixing to avoid aggregates 
in capillaries.
 20. Avoid touching the capillary in the middle where the optical 
measurement will be performed because it could modify the 
fluorescence.
 21. Detailed introduction of the manipulation of the instrument 
and the software can be downloaded elsewhere http://www.
helsinki.fi/biosciences/corefacilities/microscalethermophore -
sis/Manual_NT115.pdf .
 22. It is not recommended to use the data to determine a binding 
affinity if the deviation is more than ±10%.
 23. If a sigmoidal dose-response curve is not obtained with 20% 
nor 40% MST power, use 60% or 80% MST power.
 24. The amplitude is the difference between bound and unbound 
states, the noise is the variations of fluorescence in the baseline. 
If a high noise level is observed, experimental conditions need 
to be improved by using detergents for instance.
 25. The SD test allows verifying that the fluorescence quenching is 
due to the binding event. SD test cannot be performed with 
samples containing potassium (200  mM or more) because the 
SDS will precipitate.
Haiyang Wu et al.
141
 26. The SD test is performed only with sample 1–3 and 14–16 which 
correspond to the highest and lowest ligand concentrations 
respectively. In the case of binding event, these contrasted sam -
ples should have no difference in fluorescence. See also ( http://

Characterization of  Protein-Carbohydrate Interactions 
by NMR Spectroscopy

Abstract
Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used to monitor protein-  
carbohydrate interactions. Two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC)-
based techniques described in this chapter can be used quickly and effectively to screen a set of possible 
carbohydrate binding partners, to quantify the dissociation constant ( Kd) of any identified interactions, 
and to map the carbohydrate binding site on the structure of the protein. Here, we describe the titration 
of a family 32 carbohydrate binding module from Clostridium perfringens  (CpCBM32) with the monosac -
charide N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), in which we calculate the apparent dissociation of the interac -
tion, and map the GalNAc binding site onto the structure of CpCBM32.
Key words Chemical shift perturbation, Dissociation constant ( Kd), Heteronuclear single quantum 
coherence (HSQC), Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Protein-carbohydrate interactions
1 Introduction
Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is 
a robust method for studying interactions between proteins and 
their respective ligands. Beyond determining the high-resolution 
structure of a protein-ligand complex, other NMR techniques such 
as the transferred-NOESY experiment and saturation transfer dif -
ference spectroscopy are used to characterize protein-ligand inter -
actions (reviewed in [ 1–3]).
A particularly valuable NMR experiment for monitoring titra -
tions of ligand to a protein solution is two-dimensional 1H-15N 
heteronuclear single quantum coherence (1H-15N HSQC) [ 4], 
which can provide information regarding the ligand binding site 
on the protein structure, and the affinity and stoichiometry of the 
interaction. As a prerequisite to collecting a 1H-15N HSQC spec -
trum, the protein of interest should be uniformly 15N-labeled such 
that the chemical shifts of backbone amide nitrogen and proton 
pairs (NH) can be detected. For a folded and monodisperse  protein 
144
sample, the majority of resonances display good dispersion with 
each peak representing a backbone NH group for every non-  
proline amino acid residue in the protein sequence. The precise 
chemical shift of each NH resonance is determined by multiple 
factors, including secondary and tertiary structure, pH, tempera -
ture, and solvent. Importantly, the chemical shift of each resonance 
is sensitive to minute changes in its chemical environment, such as 
those induced by the binding of a ligand. To monitor a protein-  
ligand titration by NMR spectroscopy, a 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum 
of the protein of interest is collected after each incremental addi -
tion of ligand and the observed changes are quantified to charac -
terize the interaction.
A typical 1:1 protein-ligand interaction may be modeled as:
 PL+
kk
onoff
PL
 (1)
where P, L, and PL represent the protein, ligand, and the protein-  
ligand complex, respectively, and kon and koff represent the associa -
tion and dissociation rates of the PL complex. In such a system, the 
dissociation constant ( Kd) is defined by the ratio of kon and koff or 
by the equilibrium concentrations of P, L, and PL:
 Kk
kP Ldoff
on==[][]
[]PL
 (2)
Thus, the value of Kd can be determined either by measuring 
the koff and kon rate constants or by quantifying the equilibrium 
concentrations of P, L, and PL.  This chapter will focus on the use 
of NMR spectroscopy to quantitatively derive the Kd for protein-  
ligand interactions.
Assuming a 100  μM protein sample and that, as a rule of 
thumb for accurate Kd measurements the sample concentration 
should be <10-fold greater than the Kd, NMR spectroscopy is par -
ticularly well suited to measure the Kd of protein-ligand interac -
tions that are of moderate affinity ( Kd > 10 μM) for proteins up to 
a molecular mass of approximately 25  kDa. Cryogenic probes and 
high-field NMR also allow the protein concentration to be 
decreased so that higher affinity interactions may be accurately 
measured.
When analyzing a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra correspond -
ing to a titration of a protein with a ligand, the kinetics of the PL 
complex will determine if slow, fast, or intermediate chemical 
exchange will be observed [ 5]. If the dissociation of the PL com -
plex is slow (i.e., koff << Δω, where Δω is the frequency difference 
between the free and bound signals) two distinct sets of resonances 
will be observed in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra during the course of 
the titration. Initially, only the set of resonances corresponding to Julie M. Grondin et al.
145
the apo state of the protein is visible. Upon addition of ligand a 
second set of resonances corresponding to the bound state of the 
protein will begin to appear, while the intensity of resonances cor -
responding to the free state will accordingly decrease. The relative 
intensities of the free state and bound state resonances are a direct 
measurement of the proportion of protein in the free and bound 
states. As the protein becomes saturated with ligand, only reso -
nances corresponding to the bound state are observed. This 
exchange regime is referred to as slow chemical exchange.
If instead the PL complex dissociation is fast (i.e., koff >> Δω), a 
single set of resonances is observed during the titration. The posi -
tion of each resonance in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum is a fractional 
average of the free and bound chemical shift values. As a ligand is 
added to the protein, resonances corresponding to residues that are 
distal to the binding interface should not experience chemical shift 
changes, as their chemical environment remains constant. In con -
trast, resonances that correspond to residues in close proximity to 
the binding interface should transition from the free state chemical 
shift values to those of the bound state as ligand is added. The tra -
jectory of this movement of resonances is informative; in a simple 
1:1 binding model all peaks move linearly from the free to bound 
states at the same rate. If subsets of resonances shift from the free 
state to the bound state at different rates, or do not follow a linear 
trajectory, multiple binding events or confounding factors, such as 
changes in ionic strength or pH, may be occurring.
Finally, at intermediate rates of PL complex dissociation (i.e., 
koff ~ Δω) resonances move in the same direction as for fast 
exchange, but increased linewidths and decreased intensity of reso -
nances are observed midway through the titration. Of note, in 
some cases, resonances experience only minor line broadening dur -
ing a titration, while others may disappear quickly and completely 
once ligand is added and only reappear when saturation has 
occurred. As long as the resonance can be observed in the 1H-15N 
HSQC spectra throughout a titration, the analysis and Kd estima -
tion for a titration series is the same for both intermediate and fast 
exchange.
In NMR analysis software, such as NMRViewJ [ 6] (www.
onemoonscienctific.com/nmrviewj ) or CcpNmr Analysis [ 7] 
(www.ccpn.ac.uk/v2-software/software/analysis ), the resonance 
trajectories in the fast exchange regime can be analyzed to extract 
an estimate of Kd for each resonance of a protein using Eq. 3, 
which is derived into a quadratic equation from Eq. 2, and depends 
on NMR observables that are easily determined from a series of 
1H-15N HSQC spectra  (http://structbio.vanderbilt.edu/chazin/
wisdom/kdcalc.htm ).

where
A = Δδbound/2; B  = 1 + Kd/a; x = b/a; a is [P]; b is [L]
Δδobs and Δδbound are the differences between the free chemical shift 
and the observed or bound chemical shift, respectively, for each 
resonance experiencing a chemical shift change. The Δδ is a posi -
tive number that is the weighted sum of the 15N and 1H chemical 
shift changes for a particular resonance:
 N dd d = () + 0172 2.HN (4)
where ΔδN and ΔδHN are the chemical shift changes for a reso -
nance in the 15N and 1H dimensions of the 1H-15N HSQC, 
respectively.
Generally, nonlinear, least-square fitting of the data is applied 
to determine the values of A and B in Eq. 3. From this fit the Kd is 
determined for individual residues. The estimated Kd of multiple 
residues in a protein should be similar and may be averaged to get 
a better approximation of the Kd of the protein-ligand interaction. 
If the backbone HN resonances of the protein have been sequen -
tially assigned and the three-dimensional structure of the protein is 
known, the binding site may be mapped to the exact positions 
within the protein fold thereby identifying the ligand binding site.
When performing a NMR-based titration experiment, care 
should be taken to plan the experiment such that the volumes of 
ligand added are practical to pipette and that the protein sample 
will become saturated. In order to plan a titration experiment, 
increment volumes may be calculated using the following equation 
based on conservation of mass:
 VL VL LV V00 0 += +()ss ds (5)
which can be rearranged to
 VVLL
LLsd
sd=-
-00
 (6)
where V0 is the total volume of the sample before the subsequent 
addition of ligand (in μL); L0 is the ligand concentration before 
the subsequent addition (in μM); Ls is the concentration of the 
ligand stock (in μM); Vs is the volume of ligand stock to be added 
(in μL); Ld is the desired ligand concentration after the addition 
(in μM).
NMR-based titrations employing the 1H-15N HSQC experi -
ment have been particularly successful for monitoring the interac -
tions of several carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), which 
tend to have molecular masses of 14–25  kDa, with their glycan 
ligands [ 8–11]. While the Kd for CBM-carbohydrate interactions 
vary based on the particular type of CBM and the degree of polym -
erization of the carbohydrate, most are generally weak ( Kd in the Julie M. Grondin et al.
147
mM to μM range) and display fast exchange on the NMR timescale 
[12–16].
In this chapter, we use the specific example of monitoring an 
interaction between a family 32 CBM from Clostridium perfrin -
gens (CpCBM32) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) using the 
1H-15N HSQC experiment. Following the collection and process -
ing of the full set of 1H-15N HSQC spectra over the course of the 
titration, the spectra are overlaid in NMR analysis software such as 
NMRViewJ [ 6] or CcpNmr Analysis [ 7], and a standard integrated 
titration analysis tool in each software program is used to derive a 
Kd value for the binding event. With the completed sequential 
backbone resonance assignments and a high-resolution structure, 
we will also map the GalNAc binding site on CpCBM32.

For the example CBM-glycan titration, 1  mL of 75  mM GalNAc 
(molar mass = 221.2  g/mol) was prepared. The method below is 
optimal for the accurate preparation of small volumes (1–2  mL) of 
carbohydrate solutions for which large volumes cannot be pre -
pared for practical reasons.
 1. Record the mass of an empty 1.5  mL microcentrifuge tube.
 2. Weigh 16.6  mg GalNAc onto weigh paper. Transfer into the 
microcentrifuge tube ( see Note 3 ). Record the mass of the 
microcentrifuge tube and GalNAc together.
 3. Calculate the actual mass of GalNAc added to the microcentri -
fuge tube and add an appropriate amount of water so that the 
final solution is 75  mM. Store the carbohydrate solution at

3 Methods
 1. On Day 1, inoculate 5  mL LB media supplemented with 5  μL of 
antibiotic stock solution from a glycerol stock or streaked plate 
of Escherichia coli  strain BL(21) transformed with a pET28a(+) 
expression vector encoding a hexa-histidine tag and CpCBM32. 
Grow culture overnight at 37  °C with shaking at 200  rpm.
 2. On Day 2, finish preparing the autoclaved 50  mL M9 minimal 
media by adding 500  μL 100× NH 4Cl, 750  μL 20% (w/v) 
glucose solution, 50  μL each of CaCl 2, MgSO 4, thiamine, bio -
tin, and antibiotic solutions. Add the 5  mL overnight culture 
and grow culture overnight at 37  °C with shaking at 200  rpm.
 3. On Day 3, complete preparation of the autoclaved 1  L M9 
minimal media by adding 10  mL 100× trace element solution, 
1 g 15N NH 4Cl, 20  mL 20% (w/v) glucose solution, 5  mL 10× 
15N BioExpress growth media, 1  mL each CaCl 2, MgSO 4, thia -
mine, biotin, and antibiotic stock solution. Add the contents 
of the 50  mL overnight culture and grow culture at 37  °C with 
shaking at 200  rpm to an OD 600 of 0.6–0.8.
 4. Induce protein expression by adding 1  mL of the IPTG stock 
solution (total concentration of 1  mM IPTG) and continue 
growth with shaking for 8  h.
 5. Purify protein according to standard purification protocols 
(see Note 5 ).
 6. Quantify the purified protein by UV absorbance using Beer’s 
Law and the extinction coefficient of the protein construct. If 
an extinction coefficient for a protein has not been experimen -
tally determined, a reasonable estimate can be calculated based 
on its primary sequence using the ProtParam tool of the 
ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal [ 17].
 1. Prepare a 650  μL solution containing 100  μM CpCBM32, 
10% v/v D 2O, and 1  μM DSS.  Use buffer that is matched to 
the protein sample to dilute the sample as necessary.
 2. Using a 3  mm micro pH probe, verify the pH of the sample 
using dilute HCl or NaOH ( see Note 5 ).
 3. Transfer 600  μL of the CpCBM32 protein sample to a 5  mm 
NMR tube ( see Note 6 ).
 1. Using Eq. 6 calculate the volume additions required to com -
plete the titration. For this example, we have calculated the 
required carbohydrate additions to titrate GalNAc to a final 
concentration of 5  mM ( see Notes 7  and 8, Table 1).
 2. Place the sample into the NMR spectrometer and let the sam -
ple temperature equilibrate for 5–10  min. After equilibration, 
calibrate the tune, match, lock, and shims of the spectrometer 3.1 Expression 
and Purification

according to standard protocol. Calibrate the 1H and 15N off -
set frequencies, 1H and 15N pulse widths, determine a suitable 
15N spectral width, and collect a 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum 
of the CpCBM32 protein sample ( see Note 9 , Fig. 1a).
 3. Remove the NMR tube from the spectrometer and add the 
first increment of GalNAc (Table 1) to the upper inner side of 
the tube. To mix, cap the NMR tube and invert the sample 
several times. Firmly flick the NMR tube downward a final 
time to collect the sample in the bottom of the tube. Insert the 
NMR tube into the NMR spectrometer, let the sample equili -
brate, calibrate the lock, and shim. Collect another 2D 1H-15N 
HSQC spectrum using identical experimental parameters.
 4. Repeat step 3  until the titration is complete. This will result in 
a set of 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra each corresponding to a 
particular concentration of GalNAc.
 5. Process the individual 1H-15N HSQC spectra using standard 
NMR processing software, such as NMRPipe [ 19], TopSpin, 
or VnmrJ.
 6. Prior to quantitative titration analyses, the spectra can be over -
laid and differentially colored to visualize site-specific chemical 
shift changes through the course of the titration (Fig. 1a).Table 1

Inset: the titration of incremental additions of GalNAc to a 100  μM 15N-labeled sample of CpCBM32 was moni -
tored using overlapping 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra. ( b) The resulting normalized residue-specific chemical shift

In order to obtain the best estimate of Kd some precautions should 
be followed:
 1. Adjust the data contours such that no resonances can be attrib -
uted to noise.
 2. It is important to pick backbone HN resonances within a soft -
ware package which are well resolved and not overlapped so 
that the Kd calculation will be as accurate as possible.
 3. While theoretically any HN resonance that experiences a 
chemical shift change could provide a measurement of Kd, one 
should select those HN resonances that undergo the largest 
chemical shift change ( Δδ). Generally, we consider resonances 
with a Δδ greater than 0.5–1 standard deviations above the 
mean Δδ of all residues in a protein to be significant and directly 
associated with ligand binding (Fig. 1b). A Kd value for each of 
these significantly affected backbone resonances can be calcu -
lated individually, and then averaged into a single apparent Kd 
representing the entire binding event.
The Titration Analysis tool within NMRViewJ allows the user to 
track Δδ across a series of spectra. For a detailed discussion con -
cerning the use of NMRViewJ, please consult the excellent docu -
mentation for the software [ 6].
 1. Export the chemical shift list (.xpk file) from the apo and fully 
bound spectra (i.e., 0  mM GalNAc and 5  mM GalNAc). Using 
the amide proton and nitrogen perturbations from the apo and 
bound chemical shift list, calculate total weighted Δδ for each 
backbone amide resonance using Eq. 4.
 2. Proceed with titration analysis using the standard Titration 
Analysis tool protocol in NMRViewJ.  Briefly, Kd values derived 
from those significantly perturbed backbone amide resonances 
are interpolated from plots of the chemical shift change as a 
function of carbohydrate concentration, and a nonlinear fit is 
individually applied to significantly perturbed backbone amide 
resonances (Fig. 1c). An overall average Kd value and standard 
deviation can be calculated from these individual dissociation 
constants.
CcpNmr Analysis has a straightforward interface that allows the 
user to assess chemical shift changes between spectra and to deter -
mine a Kd for individual residues of a protein. For a more detailed 
discussion, please consult the excellent CcpNmr Analysis docu -
mentation [ 6].
 1. Load the 1H-15N HSQC spectra into CcpNmr Analysis and 
pick the peaks in each spectrum. The peaks do not need to be 
assigned.3.4 Data Analysis

 2. To fit Kd values in Analysis, the titration data must be grouped 
together into a series. Use the “NMR Series” panel to do this. 
Create a new series and set the varied parameter to be ligand 
concentration. Then use the “Add Series Point” button to 
load in the set of 1H-15N HSQC spectra. It is convenient to 
name the spectra according to the concentration of ligand 
present for that data. Set the appropriate ligand concentration 
value and units for each spectrum.
 3. Use the “Follow Shift Changes” tool to fit and analyze the 
titration data. Set the reference peak list to be the spectrum 
corresponding to free protein. Set the fitting function to Eq. 3 
(see Note 10 ), and set the binding site concentration to what 
was used in the experiment (in this example, 100  μM). Finally, 
click “Group & Fit Peaks.”
 4. The fitted data will appear in the “Peak Groups & Analysis” 
window. In the resulting table the fit parameters including the 
Kd are listed for each peak. A plot of the experimental vs. fit 
data is available for each resonance, which can be used to find 
and correct outliers in the data and to identify the most reliable 
measurements. Finally, the data can be exported as a text file 
for import into other software.
Titration analysis will result in a subset of significantly perturbed 
backbone amide residues that can be mapped onto the surface of 
the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the protein 
using molecular graphics software such as PyMOL [ 20]. These 
residues should be differentially colored with respect to the rest of 
the structure to quickly and easily map the binding site, as affected 
residues generally cluster to form a contiguous binding site on the 
surface of the protein (Fig. 1d).
4 Notes
 1. Ensure that all trace elements are dissolved in water before 
adding the EDTA.  Mixing all reagents at once will result in a 
precipitate that is extremely difficult to redissolve.
 2. For NMR studies, ionic strength of buffer solutions should 
considered since high salt concentrations can affect the spec -
trometer’s shimming process. In our experience working with 
salt concentrations <150  mM is routine. The pH of the solu -
tion should be kept below 7.5 to avoid chemical exchange of 
surface backbone amide protons, which are used to monitor 
ligand binding.
 3. The measurement and accurate transfer of mg amounts of car -
bohydrate powders for the preparation of small stock volumes 
may be required due to the cost of the carbohydrate, but can 3.4.3  Mapping 
the Binding SiteNMR of Protein-Carbohydrate Interactions 
154
lead to weighing inaccuracies. Small amounts of carbohydrate 
powders may be electrostatic and difficult to fully transfer into 
a microcentrifuge tube. Fold the weigh paper diagonally, 
ensuring that the paper is well creased. This will make the 
paper easier to handle and the carbohydrate easier to tip into 
the small opening of the microcentrifuge tube.
 4. Due to the minimal composition of the M9 minimal media 
protein expression and purification yields from growth in this 
media are typically lower than those obtained from growth in 
enriched media. As such, depending on the expression level of 
a protein of interest, a larger volume of media may be required 
to ensure sufficient protein is produced for this experiment. 
Assuming a minimum 500  MHz spectrometer with a room 
temperature probe, a 100  μM protein sample is sufficient to 
obtain strong NMR signal. Each carbohydrate to be tested will 
require the preparation of a separate protein sample.
 5. Briefly, harvest the cells by centrifugation at 6500  × g for 
10 min and resuspend the pellet in 20  mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 
0.5 M NaCl. Lyse the cells on ice by sonication using 1  s 
medium intensity sonic pulses for 2  min. Submit the cell lysate 
to high-speed centrifugation at 17,500  × g for 45  min to 
remove cell debris and insoluble proteins. Purify the hexa-  
histidine tagged protein of interest via Ni2+ affinity chromatog -
raphy, using a step-wise imidazole gradient (0–500  mM) to 
elute the protein from the column. Assess the protein contents 
of each elution fraction by SDS-PAGE.  Pool fractions contain -
ing the eluted protein and dialyze against a solution of 25  mM 
Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 50  mM NaCl to remove the imidazole. 
Concentrate the dialyzed protein to a volume of approximately 
1–2 mL. Further purify the protein of interest by size exclusion 
chromatography using a Hi-Prep 16/60 S200 Sephacryl col -
umn. Pool and concentrate the fractions containing the puri -
fied protein, and assess the purity by SDS-PAGE.
 6. We recommend the addition of 1–2  μL of 1  M HCl or NaOH 
at a time. After each addition, remove the pH probe, cap the 
microcentrifuge tube, invert gently to mix, and gently centri -
fuge to collect the sample at the bottom of the tube. Replace 
the probe and repeat until the desired pH is achieved.
 7. The optimal sample volume for a 5  mm NMR tube is approxi -
mately 600  μL. Smaller volumes may be used but may be 
more difficult to shim to obtain good quality data. Transfer 
the solution into the NMR tube by pipetting onto the side of 
the tube. Should the solution get stuck at the top of the tube, 
cap the tube and gently flick the tube in a downward motion 
until the solution reaches the bottom. Use a thin strip of 
Parafilm to seal the seam between the cap and the tube to 
ensure that the sample does not dry out before use.Julie M. Grondin et al.
155
 8. To prevent excessive dilution of the protein, the total volume 
of the sample at the end of the titration should not exceed 10% 
more than the initial starting sample volume. As such, the 
stock solutions of each carbohydrate must be sufficiently con -
centrated that this condition can be met, but dilute enough so 
that volumes that are accurate to pipette are used in each 
addition.
 9. The addition of a single saturating dose of carbohydrate to a 
protein sample and the subsequent observation of the absence 
or presence of site-specific chemical shift changes can be used 
to qualitatively assess binding between the carbohydrate and 
protein prior to undertaking a full NMR-based titration. This 
is particularly helpful if the carbohydrate ligands of the protein 
are unknown. A separate protein sample should be prepared 
for each carbohydrate to be tested, as well as for each titration 
to be performed.
 10. The collection parameters of the spectrum will vary depending 
on, among other things, the probe, field strength of the instru -
ment, and the sample quality. Some effort should be made to 
refine the data collection parameters to optimize data quality 
and experimental time. These refined parameters should be 
consistently used over the course of the titration.
 11. The fitting algorithm of CcpNmr analysis assumes that the 
concentration of protein does not change during a titration 
[7]. In order to accommodate this condition it is prudent to 
dissolve the carbohydrate stock solution in a small volume of 
NMR buffer containing free CBM. In this way, protein, salt, 
and pH changes are minimized during the titration and larger 
volumes of titrant may be added to achieve saturation.

Measuring the  Biomechanical Loosening Action 
of Bacterial Expansins on  Paper and  Plant Cell Walls
Daniel  J. Cosgrove, Nathan  K. Hepler, Edward  R. Wagner, 
and Daniel  M. Durachko
Abstract
Expansins are proteins that loosen plant cell walls but lack enzymatic activity. Here, we describe two 
protocols tailored to measure the biomechanical activity of bacterial expansin. The first assay relies on 
weakening of filter paper by expansin. The second assay is based on induction of creep (long-term, irreversible 
extension) of plant cell wall samples.
Key words Cellulose, Creep, Expansin, Filter paper, Plant cell wall, Wall loosening proteins
1 Introduction
Expansins are unique cell-wall loosening proteins that characteris -
tically induce stress relaxation and creep of plant cell walls, yet no 
bona fide enzymatic activity has been identified for these proteins 
[1, 2]. Consequently, assessments of expansin activity are based on 
biomechanical assays of cell walls or similar cellulosic materials 
[3–7]. The walls of growing plant cells consist of a polylamellate 
scaffold of cellulose microfibrils noncovalently bonded to a matrix 
of complex polysaccharides (predominantly pectins and hemicel -
luloses) and small amounts of glycoproteins [ 8, 9]. The growing 
plant cell wall is mechanically strong and able to withstand large 
tensile forces created by cell turgor pressure, yet it is also able to 
expand irreversibly in surface area in a pH-dependent process 
mediated by expansins. Expansin activity is traditionally measured 
by induction of creep (slow, irreversible extension) of cell walls or 
similar cellulosic materials that are clamped in tension [ 10].
To briefly summarize cell wall biomechanics: the stress-strain 
properties of growing plant cell walls are complex; without expan -
sins they behave to a first approximation like a hydrated solid mate -
rial that combines visco-elastic and visco-plastic properties [ 11–13]. 
158
Treatment with expansin induces a visco-elastic fluid behavior, 
resulting in slow irreversible deformation (creep) when the walls 
are held in constant tensile stress above a yield threshold [ 2, 14]. 
When expansin is removed, the walls stop creeping and revert to 
their solid-like behavior, but the deformation (strain) remains.
Expansin is hypothesized to loosen selective sites (“biome -
chanical hotspots”) where cellulose microfibrils are laterally bound 
to each other via noncovalent interactions involving hemicellulose 
such as xyloglucan [ 15–17]. Expansin action facilitates microfibril 
slippage and separation in response to mechanical tension in the 
cell wall, resulting in cell wall creep. Cell walls isolated from some 
growing plant tissues can extend irreversibly up to two-fold under 
the action of expansins, at rates that may equal or exceed the nor -
mal growth rate of the living plant tissues.
We currently recognize three major groups of expansins, dif -
ferentiated by protein sequence and by activity. The first two 
groups, synthesized by plants, named α-expansins and β-expansins, 
are involved in plant growth, fruit softening, and many other 
events during plant development [ 10]. The third group is a het -
erogeneous collection of proteins from bacteria and other microbes 
[18, 19]. Phylogenetic studies indicate that microbial expansins 
arose by lateral gene transfer, probably multiple times, from plants 
to bacteria and fungi [ 20]. These xenologs facilitate colonization 
of plant surfaces and plant vascular systems by some (not all) com -
mensal or pathogenic bacteria [ 18].
Assays for the three groups of expansins differ, reflecting dif -
ferences in targets and/or cell wall structure. The assay of 
α-expansin generally relies on measurement of creep of isolated 
dicot cell walls, e.g., from hypocotyl walls, in a constant-force 
extensometer. The procedure was described in detail previously 
[21]. The assay of β-expansin is similar but makes use of isolated 
cell walls from the grass family (Poaceae, e.g., young coleoptile 
walls from maize or wheat seedlings) [ 22–24]. The use of different 
walls as substrates reflects the fact that the dominant hemicellulose 
of grass cell walls is arabinoxylan, whereas in dicots it is xyloglucan 
[25]. The two groups of plant expansins are believed to target dif -
ferent load-bearing junctions within the growing walls. Dicot walls 
and grass walls likely include both types of junctions, but their rela -
tive importance for wall mechanics varies in the two groups of 
plants. We have measured the activity of bacterial expansins by 
creep of grass cell walls [ 7] and cellulosic composites synthesized 
by Gluconacetobacter xylinus  [4, 26, 27], and by breaking-strength 
measurements that make use of cellulosic filter paper as the sub -
strate [ 27].
Here, we describe two protocols tailored for measuring bacte -
rial expansin activity, by breaking strength of paper and by creep of 
wheat coleoptile cell walls. In the first method (Subheading 3.1), a 
strip of wet filter paper is clamped in a device that extends the

159
paper at a constant rate while monitoring the force applied to the 
paper. The maximum force attained by the paper strip is taken as a 
measure of the breaking strength. In the second method 
(Subheading 3.2), a wall sample prepared from the growing cole -
optile of a wheat seedling is held in a constant-force extensometer; 
after the initial visco-elastic transient has decayed, expansin is added 
to the sample and the resulting increase in extension rate is taken 
as a measure of expansin activity. These methods have been used to 
quantify expansin activity of several microbial expansins [ 26] and 
of site-directed mutants of EXLX1 from Bacillus subtilis  [27].
2 Materials
Prepare solutions using reagent grade chemicals and deionized 
water and store at room temperature unless indicated otherwise.
 1. Whatman filter paper No. 3 cut into 10  × 1.5-mm strips 
(see Note 1 ). Ten strips are used per treatment.
 2. HEPES buffer: 25  mM HEPES (dissolve 0.596  g of 
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid in 90  mL 
of water, adjust to pH  7.5 with 1  M KOH, then bring volume 
to 100  mL.
 3. Expansin Solution: purified native or recombinant protein, 
e.g., EXLX1 from Bacillus subtilis  [27], dissolved at a concen -
tration of 50–200  μg/mL in HEPES buffer.
 4. Commercial or custom-made extensometer ( see Fig. 1): 
Suitable commercial instruments are often to be found in polymer 
material testing laboratories (e.g., in the past we have used an 
Instron Universal Testing System).
 1. Wheat seeds ( Triticum spp ) (we use Seedway SW-50, but other 
cultivars and other grass species may also be used).
 2. Seed germination paper such as Versa-Pak paper from www.
seedburo.com .
 3. Seed germination trays, 30.5  × 22 × 6 cm.
 4. Light-tight box or dark room for growing the plant material.
 5. Carborundum (320 grit, Fisher Scientific, C192-500).
 1. HEPES buffer: 25  mM HEPES (dissolve 0.596  g of 
(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) in 90  mL 
of water, adjust to pH  7.5 with 1  M KOH, and then bring 
volume to 100  mL.

Bacillus subtilis  [21], dissolved at a concentration of 
50–200  μg/mL in HEPES buffer.
 3. Constant force extensometer, custom-made ( see Fig. 2 
and Note 2 ).
3 Methods
 1. Soak ten paper strips in 1  mL of HEPES buffer or in Expansin 
Solution for 4  h at 25  °C with gentle shaking or inversion to 
equilibrate the solution with the strips ( see Note 4 ).
 2. Using fine forceps, clamp the paper strip between the two 
clamps of the extensometer, with 5  mm distance between the 
clamps.3.1 Breaking

(See Note  3)
Fig. 1  Diagram of custom-built extensometer for stress-strain experiments. This is 
a mechanical testing device used to clamp the paper strips, extend the distance 
between the clamps at a constant rate (we use 1.5  mm/min, sometimes 3  mm/
min), and monitor the increasing force until breakage occurs. The instrument con -
sists of a finely threaded sliding stage scavenged from old equipment. Tissue 
samples are held in place with two smooth-jaw micro-alligator clips (Mueller 
BU-34C). Clips are stiffened at the ends with steel epoxy (J-B Weld). An additional 
piece of copper sheeting is soldered to clip ends to enlarge their gripping surface. 
Clamping surfaces have a piece of fine (~220  grit) waterproof automotive sandpa -
per glued to them to prevent sample slippage. A stepper motor (LIN Engineering 
4218L-01D-02) controlled through a computer RS-232 serial port and driver 
(Automation Direct STP-DRV-4850) allows precisely controlled movement of the 
upper clamp  using two gears and a toothed drive belt (also scavenged; 1:2 gear 
ratio) via the sliding stage. The lower clip  is affixed directly to a force transducer 
(Futek LSB200) allowing measurement of stress applied to the sample. A linear 
displacement transducer, or LVDT, (Schaevitz 050HR) coupled to the upper stage  
allows measurement of strain imposed upon the sample

 3. Extend the strip at 1.5  mm/min while recording the clamping 
force ( see Fig. 3 for an example). The force will increase, level 
off and then decrease, sometimes precipitously, as the paper 
fibers separate. The maximum force attained is taken as the 
breaking force ( see Note 5 ).
 1. Sow ~1000 wheat seeds (other grass species may also be used) 
on absorbent germination paper (e.g., Versa-Pak paper from), 
enclosed in covered germination trays.
 2. Grow in a dark room or a light-tight box for 3–4  days at 28  °C.
 3. Coleoptiles ( see Note 6 ) from healthy seedlings are cut and 
gently abraded between thumb and forefinger coated with a 3.2 Preparation 
of Coleoptile Cell  Walls
Fig. 2  Photograph of custom-built constant-force extensometer for cell wall creep 
experiments. The base of the wall specimen is clamped into the base of a 200 μL 
sample holder ( cuvette ) which is filled with buffer to keep the specimen wet 
throughout the experiment. The top of the specimen is clamped to a rod that bears 
the magnetic cylinder of the LVDT (linear variable differential transformer, the posi -
tion sensor). An upward force is applied to the sample via a lever arm and counter 
weight. Counter weights are adjustable and are normally constant throughout an 
experiment, but can be added or removed during the course of an experiment if 
desired. For different cell wall materials, preliminary trial experiments are needed 
to establish an appropriate force ( see Note 9 ). The LVDT is connected to a signal 
processor and the position is digitized and recorded by a microcomputer

paste of carborundum-water, then rinsed in distilled water to 
remove the carborundum ( see Note 7 ).
 4. The rolled leaf within the coleoptile is removed by gently snap -
ping the base of the coleoptile with your fingers and carefully 
withdrawing the leaf from the coleoptile sheath.
 5. Freeze and store coleoptiles in groups of ten at −80 °C in 
1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.
 6. Heat inactivate groups of ten coleoptile walls to remove endog -
enous expansin activity by dipping in boiling water for 15  s, 
then plunging into cold water ( see Note 8 ).
 1. With fine forceps mount the wall specimen between the exten -
someter clamps, with 5  mm between the two clamps. This 
results in a tensile force of 20  g on the specimen ( see Note 9 ).
 2. Pipette 200  μL HEPES buffer into the sample cuvette to keep 
the wall sample wet.
 3. (Optional) Replace the HEPES buffer in the cuvette with 
200 μL 70 mM NaOH for 20  min, then wash extensively with 
deionized water and finally restore HEPES buffer to the 
cuvette ( see Note 10 ).
 4. The extension rate should stabilize to a low value (<1  μm/min) 
in ~10–15  min. ( see Note 11 ).
 5. Carefully remove the HEPES buffer by a pipette attached to a 
suction and replace with 200  μL Expansin Solution. The wall 
should begin extending within 1–2  min, although it may take a 
few more minutes for this to become obvious. Figure 4 shows a 
representative creep response to EXLX1 from Bacillus subtilis .3.3 Creep

4 Notes
 1. Whatman filter paper discs can be taped to 10  mm × 1.5 mm grid 
graph paper and cut using a fabric rotary cutter. Using the graph 
paper helps ensure consistent strip sizes. The instrument used to 
cut the filter paper needs to be sharp to avoid tearing or shearing 
of the paper’s edge, which can result in reduced breaking 
strength. Scissors, unless brand new, are often too dull; a new 
single-edge razor blade can be substituted for a rotary cutter.
 2. We have not found a commercial instrument suitable for 
these measurements, although they might be on the market. 
The measuring device is very sensitive to mechanical vibrations, 
blowing air, and temperature fluctuations. We locate our

wall upon treatment with bacterial expansin (200  μg/mL of BsEXLX1, applied at 
the time indicated by the arrows )

instrument on a vibration-dampening table in a room with a 
proportional temperature controller (not on/off, which results 
in unacceptable temperature oscillations).
 3. This assay is good for qualitative assessment of activity. It has 
not been tested for linearity of response, which would be 
needed for use as a quantitative assay.
 4. Shorter or longer times may be used, but keep the times constant 
as the paper gradually weakens in water.
 5. Examine the force-extension curve and the paper strip for 
slippage within the clamp and for anomalous tearing, e.g., as a 
result of the clamp tearing the paper strip. Indications of such 
technical problems include an erratic (saw tooth) force curve 
and regular breakage at the mouth of the clamp.
 6. The coleoptile is a modified leaf sheath that covers and protects 
the delicate primary leaves. The coleoptile was used in classical 
studies on growth hormones such as auxin.
 7. Abrasion with carborundum disrupts the cuticle and provides 
buffer and protein access to the underlying cell wall.
 8. The following step is generally not used for wheat coleoptiles 
but may be needed for thicker materials such as maize coleop -
tiles and cucumber hypocotyls: Ten samples are pressed for 
10 min between two glass microscope slides (22  × 75 mm) 
lined with Kimwipe paper, using a weight of ~400  g. This step 
is needed to express cell sap and to facilitate clamping of the 
sample, which otherwise tends to split and tear in the clamp if 
excessive cell fluids remain within the sample.
 9. Different weights are needed for different cell wall samples. 
This is determined by trial and error. If the weight is too large, 
then breakage of the wall specimen occurs too soon or too 
frequently. If insufficient weight is applied, then the wall may 
not undergo creep.
 10. Treatment with NaOH causes the breaking of ester bonds, 
including diferulate crosslinks between arabinoxylans, resulting 
in solubilization of arabinoxylan. Compared to untreated sam -
ples, coleoptiles incubated in NaOH display reduced variability 
and a ~5-fold increase in response to EXLX1 [ 27]. This step is 
useful for grass cell walls, but is generally not helpful for dicot 
walls or other samples.
 11. High residual creep rate likely indicates mechanical damage to 
the sample or inadequate removal of NaOH.

Bioinspired Assemblies of  Plant Cell Walls for  Measuring 
Protein-Carbohydrate Interactions by FRAP
Gabriel  Paës
Abstract
The interactions of proteins involved in plant cell wall hydrolysis, such as enzymes and CBMs, significantly 
determine their role and efficiency. In order to go beyond the characterization of interactions with simple 
ligands, bioinspired assemblies combined with the measurement of diffusion and interaction by FRAP offer 
a relevant alternative for highlighting the importance of different parameters related to the protein affinity 
and to the assembly.
Key words Bioinspired, Diffusion, Interaction, Ligand, Protein, Enzyme, CBM, FRAP
1 Introduction
In the emerging bioeconomy era, many enzymes and noncatalytic 
proteins are involved in biorefineries for hydrolyzing plant cell wall 
polysaccharides such as cellulose and hemicellulose, in order to pro -
duce bio-based fuels, materials, and chemicals [ 1, 2]. Optimization 
of these processes to reduce operating costs and to maximize catalytic 
efficiency requires in-depth knowledge of the protein mode of inter -
actions. Most of the time, measuring interactions of proteins with 
polysaccharides is performed with pure oligomer/polymer ligands or 
synthetic molecules, using different readily accessible techniques such 
as gravimetric approach [ 3], isothermal calorimetry [ 4], fluorescence 
titration [ 5], fluorescence spectroscopy [ 6], or more sophisticated 
techniques such as atomic force microscopy [ 7]. But once in the 
complex plant polymer network, proteins often do not behave in the 
same way as observed with simple ligands. Of course, this discrepancy 
originates from the much higher chemical and structural complexity 
of plant cell walls compared to simple ligands.
To address this issue, we have designed model assemblies that 
contain some of the polymers and chemical motifs found in second -
ary plant cell walls of grasses. These bioinspired assemblies are based 
170
on a hemicellulose network whose polymers (feruloylated arabinox -
ylans, FAXs) are cross-linked through ferulic acid moieties to make 
gels under the action of a peroxidase [ 8, 9]. This network can be 
complexified by adding cellulose nano-crystals (CNCs) [ 10, 11]. 
Type and concentration of both polymers can be easily varied. 
Diffusion of a macromolecule such as a protein can be measured in 
these assemblies by using the fluorescence recovery after photo -
bleaching (FRAP) technique implemented in a fluorescence confo -
cal microscope [ 12–14]. The protein must be labeled with a 
fluorophore before it is embedded into the assembly, then its diffu -
sion coefficient can be calculated. The possibility of measuring 
interactions of the labeled protein is based on the assumption that 
if its diffusion is slower than expected on the basis of its size and 
polymer entanglements, then the protein is interacting with the 
polymer assembly. Overall, in order to discriminate the role of the 
different parameters related to the protein and/or to the structure 
of the assembly, interactions must be calculated in different assem -
blies with varied polymer concentrations, so that statistical analysis 
eventually determines the relative influence of each parameter on 
the interaction, as previously demonstrated [ 15, 16].
The method presented emphasizes preparation of bioinspired 
assemblies and of labeled proteins. Statistical analysis of interaction 
data obtained from FRAP measurements is also discussed, while 
FRAP is briefly described since many relevant articles and reviews 
have already been published for performing accurate quantitative 
FRAP analysis.

FRAP measurements can be performed on most confocal micro -
scopes. Generally, minimal equipment consists in a fluorescence 
inverted confocal microscope equipped with a laser wavelength 
corresponding to that of the fluorophore (488  nm for fluorescein). 
A FRAP analysis module embedded in the microscope software is 
also necessary. In addition, image analysis software such as the 
freeware ImageJ/Fiji and statistical analysis software are particu -
larly helpful.
3 Methods
If the protein is available in powder, begin at Subheading 3.2.
 1. Support the desalting column over a discarding beaker. Prepare 
the desalting column following the provider instruction. 
Usually, wash the column with 4–5 column-equivalent vol -
umes of water.
 2. Apply 1  mg of the protein sample, in a volume of 2.5  mL. Use 
water if a dilution of the protein stock is necessary. Let the 
sample enter the column completely.
 3. Elute with 3.5  mL of water and collect seven fractions of 
0.5 mL into plastic tubes.
 4. Measure the absorbance at 280  nm of each fraction ( see Note 2 ). 
Calculate the protein concentration in each fraction. Pool 
together the highest concentrated protein fractions and keep 
them at 4  °C (see Note 3 ). Calculate the quantity of desalted 
protein, which should be closed to 1  mg.
 1. Weigh FITC in the glass vial so that FITC molar quantity is ten 
times higher than that of the desalted protein ( see Note 4 ). 
Add 100  μL of the conjugation buffer ( see Note 5 ).2.3 Diffusion

 2. Add the desalted protein sample into the glass vial. Complete 
with water to reach a final volume of 1  mL.
 3. Cover the vial with aluminum foil and let the reaction for 2  h 
with moderate stirring (60–90  rpm).
 4. Support the column over a discarding beaker. Prepare the gel 
filtration column following the provider instruction (usually 
wash the column with 4–5 column-equivalent volumes of elu -
tion buffer).
 5. Apply the reaction mixture. Let the sample enter the column 
completely. Discard the flow through, then add 1.5  mL of elu -
tion buffer. Discard the flow through.
 6. Elute with 3.5  mL of elution buffer ( see Note 6 ). A fast dis -
placing yellow-orange band will appear, while a second band 
will stay at the top of the column. Collect only the first band 
(see Note 7 ).
 7. Measure the absorbance at 280 and 495  nm of the collected 
fraction ( see Note 2 ). Calculate the fluorescent protein con -
centration and the molar fluorophore: protein ratio using Eqs. 1 
and 2, respectively:

A280 and A495 are absorbances of the labeled protein at 280 
and 495  nm, respectively.
εprot is the molar extinction coefficient of the protein (in 
L/mol  cm).
MW prot is the protein molecular weight (in g/mol).
εfluo is the molar extinction coefficient of the fluorophore 
(in L/mol  cm).
 8. Make sure that the molar ratio is in the range 0.5–2.0 ( see Notes 
4 and 8). If it is below, prepare another labeling reaction by 
increasing the amount of FITC; if it is higher, reduce the amount 
of FITC.  Fluorescent protein concentration should be at least 
1 g/L for subsequent use. If not, it should be concentrated 
(by using, for example, Vivaspin ultrafiltration unit with a 
molecular weight cutoff adapted to the protein size).
 9. Store the fluorescent protein at 4  °C in the dark.
The bioinspired assemblies presented in this protocol contain hemi -
cellulose (FAX) and cellulose nano-crystals (CNCs) found in second -
ary plant cell walls. But other polymers of interest can be used such as 
pectins, other hemicellulose, and cellulose-type polymers.3.3 Bioinspired

 1. Prepare 2  mL of a 30  g/L FAX solution by dissolving 60  mg 
of FAX in 2  mL of the assembly buffer under moderate stirring 
in a glass vial at room temperature, overnight (at least 16  h).
 2. Prepare 2  mL of 30  g/L CNC solution by dissolving the stock 
solution in the assembly buffer ( see Note 9 ).
 3. Total volume of the assembly is set at 300  μL, since it can be easily 
prepared without consuming too much material. Mix together in 
a plastic tube 100  μL of the FAX solution at 30  g/L and 100  μL 
of the CNC solution at 30  g/L to have final concentrations of 
10 g/L for each. Add the fluorescent protein to get a final 
concentration of ca. 0.2–0.3  g/L ( see Note 10 ). Add 7  μL of 
the hydrogen peroxide solution. Complete if necessary with the 
assembly buffer at 290  μL. Mix carefully by gently pipetting up 
and down without adding any bubble ( see Note 11 ).
 4. Transfer this mix into the 8-well chamber. Add 10  μL of the 
peroxidase solution and gently mix by pipetting ( see Note 11 ). 
Gelation will start; let the reaction for at least 2  h in the dark. 
Diffusion measurements in the assemblies should be done on 
the same day or the day after the assemblies have been prepared. 
If not analyzed immediately they should be stored at 4  °C in 
the dark.
 5. Prepare as many assemblies containing the labeled protein as 
necessary, depending on the number and values of parameters 
modulated (e.g., FAX and CNC concentration).
Excellent and comprehensive protocols regarding the measure -
ment of diffusion by FRAP have already been published [ 18, 19]; 
therefore, only the main steps are presented below. FRAP measures 
the fluorescence recovery into a sample in which a region of inter -
est (ROI) has been bleached irreversibly using a high intensity laser 
light. Depending on the characteristics of the labeled protein and 
of the chemical and physical properties of assembly, diffusion can 
vary notably (Fig. 2) [14]. Image and data processing gives access 
to the diffusion coefficient D that can be turned into an interaction 
coefficient. For FRAP data to be relevant, image scanning rate 
must be as fast as possible to acquire as much data as possible. 
Indeed, the fluorescence recovery is very fast in the first seconds, 
then slows down, to finally reach (theoretically) a plateau (Fig. 2).
 1. Place the chamber containing the fluorescent protein in the 
assembly on the microscope objective, using a magnification of 
63×. Adjust the laser intensity and detectors sensitivity to 
image the sample so that the image rate is below one frame/s. 
Since the assembly has no structure at such a magnification, 
the image should be homogeneously fluorescent.
 2. Draw a circular ROI of 5  μm diameter. The ROI surface must 
not exceed 10% of the total surface of the image to leave 
enough unbleached labeled protein around the ROI.3.4 Measuring

and Interaction 
of Fluorescent Protein

 3. Collect the FRAP data in at least five different ROIs in the 
sample and in at least three different samples. Processing of the 
data should take into account reference ROIs for the uninten-
tional photobleaching. Overall, diffusion coefficient D should 
be obtained for the fluorescent protein in the different tested 
assemblies.
 4. In order to get interactions values, calculate the pseudo-affinity 
constant k*on/koff of the labeled protein in each assembly by 
using Eq. 3:
 k
kDD

 (3)
Dfree is the diffusion of the labeled protein in the assembly buf -
fer (free diffusion) and D is the diffusion of the labeled protein in 
the considered assembly, also called an effective diffusion coeffi -
cient [ 18, 19].
The goal of this section is to evaluate quantitatively the weight of 
each varied parameter (related to the fluorescent protein and/or to 
the assembly) to rank the parameters according to their influence 
on the affinity, called the response. Analysis is based on full-  factorial 
experiments and statistical analysis, using for example, dedicated 
software like Design Expert 8.0, but other software can be used.3.5 Statistical 
Analysis to  Highlight 
Meaningful 
Parameters
Fig. 2  Typical recovery curves obtained after FRAP experiments. The fluorescence intensity is measured before 
(step 1, in green ), during (step 2, in red) and after photobleaching (step 3, in blue), while equilibrium takes 
place. Several cases can be observed depending on the velocity and the amplitude of the recovery. Recovery 
can be fast with a maximal recovery ( a), or slow with a maximal recovery ( b). It can also be fast with a limited 
recovery ( c) and even slow with a limited recovery ( d) (figure from [ 14])

 1. Define the parameters that have been varied and give them an 
alias for clarity. For each parameter, identify the number of 
levels and the values of each level. For example, if FAX concen -
tration in assemblies has been varied at 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% 
while the CNC concentration has been tested at 0% and 1.0%, 
one can call the first parameter FAX, having three numerical 
levels that are 0.5/1.0/2.0 and so on.
 2. Prepare a table in which the first column corresponds to the 
first parameter, second column to the second parameter, and 
so on. Add the level values for each parameter so that all param -
eter combinations are presented, taking into account that not 
the average interaction values but each individual interaction 
value must be added in the last column corresponding to the 
response (Fig. 3).
 3. Perform the different steps of the statistical analysis in Design 
Expert. Following the ANOVA analysis, p-values are calculated 
for each parameter, so that some parameters are considered to 
be statistically significant or not. Among the former ones, the 
F-values are also indicated: the higher these values are, the 
more impact the considered parameter has on the response. 
Overall, the different parameters can be ranked according to 
their F-  values, highlighting those having a real importance

Parameter 1 has three levels while parameter 2 has two levels. Data are from 
experiments performed in triplicate. Overall, 18 different experimental data values

toward the response. Mathematically speaking, the response is 
equal to a sum of parameters and their combination, each having 
a coefficient related to their importance on the response. So if 
the parameters computed have numerical levels, the equation 
can be used to predict the response in conditions not tested 
experimentally [ 10]. The values for each parameter must 
remain between the highest and lowest levels used; other -
wise, the prediction is not statistically acceptable.
4 Notes
 1. Since the fluorophore will be used for FRAP experiments 
(i.e., photobleached), select a fluorophore that has not been 
engineered to be highly photostable.
 2. Absorbance values should be below 1.0 to respect Beer-  Lambert 
proportionality law between absorbance and concentration. 
Otherwise, dilute the sample.
 3. In general, the highest protein concentration is collected in 
fractions two and three, even it can slightly vary depending on 
protein size.
 4. FITC reacts with amine functions. If the protein is not circular, 
the N-terminal residue presents an amine function. Surface 
protein residues like Lys have an amine function. Knowing the 
number of Lys residues, or even better, the accessible Lys resi -
dues through the analysis of the protein 3D structure can help 
to adjust the fluorophore:protein ratio. This molar ratio can be 
varied from 1:1 to 100:1. Under-labeling reaction results in a 
non-fluorescently detectable protein. Over-labeling reaction 
results in altered biochemical properties (modified interactions 
and catalytic activity), physicochemical properties (stability), 
and spectral properties (loss in fluorescence due to fluorophore 
self-quenching).
 5. Depending on the type of labeling, different pH and/or buffer 
conditions can be used [ 20]. Caution must be taken to check 
whether the protein is stable under the labeling conditions 
used, in particular regarding pH value.
 6. Elution buffer should be selected so that the protein is stable 
in this buffer.
 7. The first band contains labeled proteins and non-labeled proteins; 
it moves fast because the protein is excluded from the gel 
network. The second band contains only unreacted FITC and 
salts that are much smaller and thus move very slowly. If only 
one band appears after applying elution buffer, labeling has 
not worked properly: protein is eluted without having been 
conjugated. It can mean that no accessible amine function is

present on the surface of the protein. Try to increase the amount 
of protein to be labeled. If no improvement is noted, try another 
labeling protocol involving other functions (for example hydrox -
yls that are present on serine and threonine residues). To check 
the labeling protocol, a positive control can be a commercial 
bovine serum albumin protein that is well characterized and 
displays several amine functions on its surface.
 8. Determination of labeled protein concentration can be tricky. 
Due to the protein labeling, fluorescence properties of both the 
protein and the fluorophore can be slightly altered. The best 
way to determine this parameter is to measure a fluorescence 
map of the sample by measuring fluorescence intensity when 
acquiring excitation on the range 250–600  nm and emission on 
the range 260–600  nm. Three spots should be visible: one for 
the protein for an excitation ca. 280  nm and an emission ca. 
320 nm; two other ones for the fluorophore, for an emission ca. 
520 nm (in the case of fluorescein) and an excitation ca. 280  nm 
and 490  nm. Taking as a reference the emission of the fluoro -
phore alone and comparing this value to the emission of the 
fluorophore bound to the protein gives a good estimation of 
the molar concentration of the fluorophore. The same can be 
done by taking the un-labeled protein as a reference to calculate 
the molar concentration of the protein, so that the labeling 
ratio can be determined.
 9. CNCs are only partially soluble in water buffer, so there is no 
need for stirring.
 10. Concentration should be adapted depending on the fluoro -
phore brightness and stability so that the labeled protein is 
easily imaged under a confocal microscope without uninten -
tional photobleaching. Also, fluorescence can be dramatically 
modified by pH depending on the fluorophore considered. In 
the case of fluorescein, we have found that a pH ca. 5.5–6.0 
was appropriate. In the case another fluorophore may be 
appropriate, pH should be adapted accordingly.
 11. FAX solution is highly viscous. When pipetting, mixing, and trans -
ferring FAX solution, bubbles can appear. To get rid of them, use 
a tip to guide them on the side of the tube or of the tray.

CBMs as  Probes to  Explore Plant Cell Wall Heterogeneity 
Using Immunocytochemistry
Louise  Badruna, Vincent  Burlat, and  Cédric  Y. Montanier
Abstract
Immunocytochemistry is a widely used technique to localize antigen within intact tissues. Plant cell walls are 
complex matrixes of highly decorated polysaccharides and the large number of CBM families displaying 
specific substrate recognition reflects this complexity. The accessibility of large proteins, such as antibodies, to 
their cell wall epitopes may be sometimes difficult due to steric hindrance problems. Due to their smaller size, 
CBMs are interesting alternative probes. The aim of this chapter is to describe the use of CBM as probes to 
explore complex polysaccharide topochemistry in muro  and to quantify enzymatic deconstruction.

1 Introduction
The plant cell wall organization is highly complex and continuous 
investigation needs to be performed to explore this complexity. 
Indeed, biomass is a combination of cellulose, hemicelluloses, 
pectins, proteins, and other polymers such as lignins. During 475 
million years, terrestrial plants, and more particularly plant cell wall 
evolved up to the point making them particularly recalcitrant to 
chemical or biological attack [ 1]. Furthermore, its composition is 
highly specific among species, organs, cell types, and cell wall 
microdomains [ 2, 3]. In this context, immunocytochemistry dis -
plays many advantages to allow researchers to obtain more evi -
dence about how all these macromolecules are spatially organized 
and how they interact with each other. For example, Knox and 
coworkers used this approach to localize precisely many polymer-  
specific epitopes in muro  and describe at which developmental 
stage pectic (1 →4)-β-d-galactan appears in pea [ 4].
Briefly, plant tissues sections have to be prepared in a way pre -
venting or minimizing structural changes within plant cell wall [ 5]. 
Series of monoclonal antibodies specific to plant cell wall polymers 
182
have been developed and are available ( e.g., http://www.plant -
probes.net/index.php ; https://www.ccrc.uga.edu/~carbosource/
CSS_home.html;  http://www.biosupplies.com.au/price.htm ). These 
antibodies are directed against various epitopes included within poly -
saccharidic polymers such as mannans, xyloglucans, xylans, rhamno -
galacturonans, homogalacturonans, callose, or proteins such as 
extensins or arabinogalactan proteins. For instance, LM10 and 
LM11 that target xylans could be used to discriminate (1 →4)-β-d-
xylan from (1 →4)-β-d-arabinoxylan, respectively [ 6]. An anti-rat or 
anti-mouse IgG labeled secondary antibody is then used against the 
first antibody to enhance the signal and to enable detection by 
microscopy [ 4]. The secondary antibody may display an alkaline 
phosphatase activity or a peroxidase activity for use with chromo -
genic substrates. It may also be labeled with a fluorochrome or gold 
particles, for fluorescent or transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM), respectively.
CBMs are domains which are found independently or next to an 
enzyme that hydrolyzes polysaccharides from plant cell walls [ 7]. 
They can be produced alone with correct folding and functions. 
A lot of CBMs have been found in Nature with different ligand 
specificities, e.g., xylans [ 8], crystalline cellulose [ 9], amorphous cel -
lulose [ 10], mannans [ 11], or starch [ 12].
Pioneer studies in the 1980s used the carbohydrate binding 
capacities of CBM contained within carbohydrate hydrolyzing 
enzymes by producing carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme-colloidal 
gold complexes for labeling at the TEM level [ 13, 14]. Then, 
Johansson and coworkers introduced for the first time the use of 
CBM-fluorochrome to probe cellulose in lignocellulose material 
such as birchwood or pulp fibers [ 15]. The family 1 CBM from 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  Cel7D was covalently labeled to fluo -
rescein isothiocyanate (FITC) through α-amino group. 
Alternatively, Knox and coworkers used Histidine-Tagged CBMs 
as molecular probes, which introduced experimental flexibility as 
the CBM could be revealed with anti-HistidineTag antibodies and 
then with a tertiary labeled antibody. This latter approach also 
presents the advantage of preventing inactivation of the CBM due 
to the FITC labeling [ 16].
CBMs have advantageous properties over immunocytochemis -
try, being easy to produce and purify, facilitating implementation 
and reproducibility of their use [ 17]. They show affinity for their 
ligand and relatively high selectivity for their target in a specific 
context [ 18]. Indeed, different CBMs displaying affinity to the 
same ligand in  vitro may target different polysaccharides in plant 
cell walls sections [ 19]. CBMs could also be used to monitor enzy -
matic glycoside hydrolysis activity. In the situation where CBM 
ligands were masked within the dense plant cell wall matrix, their 
accessibility could be recovered using pretreatment with enzymes 
such as pectate lyase Pel10A from Cellvibrio japonicus  decloaking

cellulose microfibrils on tobacco [ 20]. Another parameter that can 
be considered is the three-dimensional orientation of the CBM 
within the protein that may reflect the ligand context through pro -
tein/carbohydrate interactions.
Other classical cytochemical labeling methods may also be 
useful in combination to CBMs or antibodies or by themselves. 
These include carmine [ 21] or calcofluor white [ 22] that recog -
nizes β-glucans [ 23], Pontamine Fast Scarlet 4B that target cellu -
lose [ 24]. Toluidine Blue O that block cell wall autofluorescence 
may also be used for better visualization of the exogenous fluores -
cent labeling [ 23].
Sample preparation is a crucial step and the way samples are 
prepared may affect the way CBMs or enzymes act on plant cell 
wall polymers. Sample preparation should also be performed in 
accordance with the microscopic technique to be used. The thick -
ness of the plant cell wall section is important and it may be adjusted 
in direct link to the stiffness of the sample and to the resolution 
required. For instance, resin is more resolutive than paraffin/wax 
since allowing thinner sections, but this irreversible embedding 
technique may hide or restrict CBM/antibody accessibility, since 
the labeling is basically restricted to the surface of the section. In 
our protocol, we used wheat straw, a particularly rigid sample dif -
ficult to cut, but we choose a smooth weak fixation associated with 
a reversible paraffin embedding approach, minimizing as much as 
possible further chemical modification of the cell wall polymers 
and accessibility of the probes to their targets.
Otherwise, a sample predigestion may highlight polymer rec -
ognition by antibodies or CBMs as illustrated with a xylanase 
(hydrolyzing β-1,4 linkages of xylans main chain) and/or a pectate 
lyase (hydrolyzing homogalacturonans) used on tobacco [ 18]. 
Some works are also based on an esterase (splits off acetyl groups) 
[25] or a mannanase (breaking down mannans) [ 26].
Below, we will use the family 3 CBM3a from Clostridium ther -
mocellum  as a probe to illustrate our protocol . This CBM is part of 
the multicomponent multienzyme complex, called the cellulosome 
[27]. The cellulosome is a discrete cell surface organelle of C. ther -
mocellum  which exhibits separate cellulose binding and various cel -
lulolytic activities [ 28]. CBM3a is part of the scaffold protein CipA 
and displays the highest affinity for crystalline cellulose. This CBM 
is widely used in immunocytochemistry [ 29–31], in glycan bind -
ing assay [ 32] or even as a probe using atomic force microscopy 
[33]. However, this protocol should be applicable to other CBMs 
or antibodies.

mirror; 420–460  nm emission filter set, bright field, color balance) 
by testing with positive and negative control slides.
 17. Scan and save images.
The following analyses are possible on the images using the NDP.
view2 freeware. A qualitative protocol consists in a comparison 
between series of images taken from serial sections synchronized 
on the same zone on the computer screen: with/without the first 
probe to estimate the background level and with/without an enzy -
matic treatment to estimate the enzymatic action. A quantitative 
protocol can be to count cells before and after an enzymatic treat -
ment. The next step is an analysis to quantify the relative fluores -
cence intensity with ImageJ on selected areas, e.g., pith parenchyma 
and sclerenchyma/cortical parenchyma/epidermis ( see Note 25 ). 
The protocol is as follows.
 1. Open images to be compared with NDP.view2.
 2. Determine and apply the same exact parameters for the images 
to be analyzed (color balance, brightness, contrast, gamma, 
and so on).
 3. Zoom on an area of interest.3.7 Section Analysis

 4. Align, synchronize, and frame each image on the same area for 
serial sections ( see Notes 26  and 27).
 5. Save the images of this area.
 6. Open first an image with ImageJ.
 7. Split channels (red, green, blue).
 8. Choose a reference channel.
 9. Set a threshold with triangle method ( see Note 28 ).
 10. Measure the intensity.
 11. Repeat steps 6 –10 for all images.
 12. Save and plot data (Microsoft Excel file).
 13. Compare data.
As an example, three wheat straw serial cross-sections individu -
ally treated for three conditions are illustrated in Fig. 2 and the quan -
tified results of mean for at least two repeats of similar areas are 
represented in Fig. 3. Maximum fluorescence was obtained for 
Fig. 2b and the lowest fluorescence was for Fig. 2c allowing estimat -
ing the nonspecific background due to autofluorescence. The relative 
action of the enzymatic cocktail can therefore be selectively quanti -
fied for various tissues on the same sections.
This method and the presented examples clearly illustrate the 
possibilities to measure relative fluorescence intensities for differ -
ent tissues found on the same section and to compare these with 
the same zone differentially treated on serial sections. This example 
shows that the enzymatic action is more pronounced in the scle -
renchyma/cortical parenchyma/epidermis zone as compared to 
the pith parenchyma.
4 Notes
 1. This fixative is adapted from the classical FAA fixative deprived 
from the 3.7% (v/v) cross-linking formaldehyde. FAA (100  mL 
of Formalin (37  mL of formaldehyde Sigma-Aldrich F1635 
and 63  mL of dH 2O), 500  mL of ethyl alcohol, 50  mL of 
acetic acid, 350  mL of dH 2O could be used instead of AA. 
However, formaldehyde may prevent enzymatic pretreatment 
degradation and/or CBM recognition as it is a covalent cross-
linker and could disrupt polymers.
 2. CBM3a homemade production was done by the authors as in 
[20] with the Histidine-Tag at the C-terminal end of the con -
struct. This CBM is also commercially available (Plant Probes 
or CZ00411 on NZytech).

 3. Humid chamber can be bought or homemade chamber can be 
assembled with large Petri dishes and two lines of broken 
Pasteur pipets taped at the bottom to accommodate the slides, 
preventing them from being flooded by the dH 2O placed at 
the bottom of the Petri dish.
Fig. 2  Zoom on the same exact zone of three serial sections treated as described in the right panel. The frames

blue for a zone encompassing sclerenchyma/cortical parenchyma/epidermis. The crystalline cellulose detected 
by CBM3a is displayed in green (FITC channel). The blue channel shows the lignin autofluorescence used as a

 6. The tissue embedding can be realized directly or Paraplast 
infiltrated tissues may be stored with cap at 4  °C for years. 
In this case, on restart, samples need to be incubated for 1 day 
at 60  °C before performing the tissue embedding.
 7. The separation between metallic embedding base molds and 
samples could be done directly or after storage at 4  °C for years.
 8. Slides after treatment can be stored at room temperature for 
months.
 9. Use a pencil because pen marks would disappear with solvent.
 10. The soaking of the Paraplast embedded bloc in a solution of 
acetic acid and ethanol (step A-2-9) for few weeks may improve 
sectioning efficiency for hard tissues.
 11. Sample sectioning is easier when performed directly with 
cooled samples directly following taking out these from 4  °C.
 12. Keep the same thickness for all sections to allow a comparison 
of labeling intensities between serial sections. 10  μm was cho -
sen for wheat straw internodes because it is a relatively hard 
material.
 13. Use this dH 2O bath for only four sections in parallel to keep 
the order of serial sections.
 14. The incubation is material dependent, for some samples 20  s 
could be enough.
 15. Be careful about the serial sections positioning on the sequen -
tial slides to be able to further compare the same area on serial 
sections treated with different conditions.
 16. The use of tissue floating bath is useful, especially for breakable 
tissues since it avoids excessive volumes of dH 2O between the 
section and the slide. However, another method without such a 
bath exists: degas dH 2O in a vacuum chamber for at least 1  h to 
avoid air bubble formation. Annotate slides. Place on a slide 
warmer at 35  °C. Add 2–3  mL of degassed dH 2O. Cut serial sec -
tions of 10–20  μm with the rotary microtome. Separate sections. 
Place them on the same orientation and on the same position on 
each slide. Remove dH 2O in excess with a pipette. Dry overnight 
at 35  °C on the slide warmer.
 17. To find reaction conditions, do preliminary tests with a range of 
concentrations for example. The aim is to find an intermediate 
concentration enabling sufficient digestion to observe changes 
and avoiding excessive digestion that could result in section 
detachment from the slide.
 18. Use a micro-incubation chamber with a silicone seal to avoid 
the solution evaporation.
 19. To improve micro-incubator use, cut a thin opening (1  mm 
wide) in the silicone. Firmly press this 200  μL micro-  incubation 
Immunochemistry and CBMs
194
chamber on the top of the section area and distribute 200  μL 
through this opening. Finally, close it by adding 10–20  μL 
of 1% agarose in fusion (around 40  °C). After the incubation, 
remove agarose with the use of a razor blade. Such micro-  
incubation chambers may be washed and reused.
 20. Sections should not dry during the labeling process, since this 
could result in excessive unspecific background. Insure to add 
the next solution at each step just after the removal of the pre -
vious one. For blocking and washing steps, slides are com -
monly handled in polypropylene staining racks for 20 slides 
fitting to glass staining jars each containing around 200  mL of 
solution. For incubation steps, slides are handled individually 
within a humid chamber with smaller volumes (100–200  μL 
with a coverslip on each slide to avoid the evaporation).
 21. Samples may be labeled in several ways. For example, the first 
step can be done using antibody directed against cell wall poly -
mer (e.g., rat monoclonal LM11 antibody from Plant Probes, 
which binds to unsubstituted β-1,4 xylans or arabinoxylans dis -
playing a low degree of arabinose substitutions). The second 
step consists of using a secondary antibody. This one could be 
the Anti-RatIgG-FITC (Sigma) or the Anti-rat IgG-alkaline 
phosphatase (AP) conjugates. In the last case, 5-bromo-
4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP)/nitroblue tetrazolium 
(NBT) is used as the AP substrate. The enzymatic activity will 
release a blue to purple insoluble NBT diformazan end prod -
uct (some washes with dH 2O will stop the reaction).
 22. Each CBM probe has to be chosen regarding the target of 
interest within the plant section. We choose to work with a 
monoclonal secondary antibody that recognizes specifically the 
Histidine-Tag from the CBM.  The tertiary species-specific 
labeled antibody will target the secondary antibody. In each 
experiment, to have details on the background, controls need 
to be performed with the same labeling except the first probe.
 23. Usually, CBMs are used at a concentration comprised between 
10 and 100  μg/mL [ 23] but dilutions should be tested to 
optimize the signal/background ratio.
 24. Remove coverslips gently after each antibody incubation to 
avoid a section tearing. For this, allow the coverslip to fall by 
itself or dip the slide in a TTBS 500 bath to facilitate coverslip fall 
over. Do not remove the coverslip by hand since the applied 
pressure could result in section damage.
 25. Many samples can be accommodated within a slide as in Fig. 1a, 
constituting so-called tissue microarrays [ 38]. This multiplica -
tion of samples secures final analysis if one sample is lost from 
the slide or damaged during the labeling process, and this allows 
comparing more samples ( e.g., mean ± standard deviation, 
Louise Badruna et al.
195
 various developmental stages, organs, or species) between 
treatment/labeling conditions.
 26. This step is very important. To compare each treatment or 
labeling, sections of interest need to be aligned very precisely 
on all directions to compare the exact same zone on serial 
sections differentially treated.
 27. NDP.view2 has a lot of functions (zoom, scale bar addition, 
work with only one channel, exportation of the image for exam -
ple). It allows annotations (rectangle to delimit the area where 
the work is done, color) and a comment (sample number for 
example) to avoid working two times on the same area.
 28. The threshold will delimit the fluorescence quantification. The 
image without the first probe can be used to set the threshold.

Abstract
Investigating the subcellular location of secreted proteins is valuable for illuminating their biological function. 
Although several bioinformatics programs currently exist to predict the destination of a trafficked protein 
using its signal peptide sequence, these programs have limited accuracy and often require experimental 
validation. Here, we present a systematic method to fractionate gram-negative cells and characterize the 
subcellular localization of secreted carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes). This method involves four 
parallel approaches that reveal the relative abundance of protein within the cytoplasm, periplasm, outer mem -
brane, and extracellular environment. Cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins are fractionated by lysis and 
osmotic shock, respectively. Outer membrane bound proteins are determined by comparing cells before 
and after exoproteolytic digestion. Extracellularly secreted proteins are collected from the media and concen -
trated. These four different fractionations can then be probed for the presence and quantity of target proteins 
using immunochemical methods such as Western blots and ELISAs, or enzyme activity assays.

1 Introduction
Signal peptides are short amino acid sequences appended to the 
N-terminus, C-terminus, or within the internal sequence of a pro -
tein [ 1]. They are employed across all domains of life and serve to 
signal the subcellular localization of secreted proteins [ 2, 3]. 
Accurate subcellular trafficking of proteins is essential for the func -
tion of many different classes of proteins, including virulence 
 factors, transporters, and catabolic enzymes. Thus, determining 
the subcellular destination of a protein can help to elucidate its 
function. In gram-negative cells, signal peptides traffic proteins 
into the periplasm, onto the surface of or into cellular membranes, 
or into the local environment surrounding the cell. Conventionally, 
proteins that lack signal peptides are not secreted and are destined 
200
to function within the cytoplasm [ 4] (Fig. 1a). Although several 
bioinformatics programs exist to predict the destination of a 
secreted protein from signal peptide sequence, they have limited 
accuracy and often require experimental validation [ 5]. Established 
protocols for the lysis of gram-negative bacteria are diverse [ 6–8]; 
however, protocols for accurately fractionating the periplasmic 
contents from the cytoplasmic contents are less common. Most 
periplasmic protein protocols aim to maximize yields [ 9, 10], 
which may result in contamination by cytoplasmic proteins. Here, 
we present an optimized osmotic shock protocol adapted from [ 9, 
10] which improves the purity of the periplasmic fraction by mini -
mizing contamination by cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 1b). The 
remaining cytoplasmic compartment is subsequently lysed to 
extract the cytoplasmic contents.
Most established protocols for the purification of membrane 
bound CAZymes are performed to extract functional membrane 
proteins. This is effective; however, it is time consuming and 
requires expensive equipment such as ultracentrifuges and complex 
density gradients [ 4]. The protocol presented here, adapted from 
[11–13], has been used for the identification of surface-exposed 
CAZymes without purification (Fig. 1b). Cells are incubated in the 
presence or absence of Proteinase K and blotted onto PVDF mem -
brane. The dots are then bound by specific antibodies to determine 
if the protein signal was removed in the proteolytically treated 
sample (Fig. 2). Below we provide a detailed description of how 
these methods are performed and how they can be used to enable 
accurate comparison between periplasmic and cytoplasmic traffick -
ing of a target CAZyme.
2 Materials

3 Methods
The following protocols have been optimized for evaluating signal 
peptides appended to the N-terminus of proteins during heterolo -
gous expression in E. coli . Although over-expression protocols 
have been established for E. coli  which can increase the total 
amount of protein produced and, by extension, simplify detection 
of proteins, nonnative signal peptides in E. coli  may behave abnor -
mally. In this work, we demonstrate that signal peptides from spe -
cies unrelated at the level of phylum can function properly; 
however, when possible, signal peptides should be verified in their 
native species as well.
 1. Vectors containing the gene of interest (GOI) can be gener -
ated using established molecular biology techniques or be 
commercially synthesized.
 2. Transform vectors containing GOI into E. coli  according to 
selected manufacturers’ instructions ( see Note 9 ).
 3. Inoculate 5  mL of LB containing appropriate antibiotic. 
Incubate at 37  °C with agitation until a cell density of OD 600nm 
~0.8 is reached.
 4. Subculture 1  mL of culture into 1  L of LB containing appro -
priate antibiotic. Incubate at 37  °C with agitation until a cell 
density of OD 600nm ~0.8 is reached.
 5. Reduce temperature of the culture to 16  °C with continued 
agitation (~1  h) (see Note 10 ).
 6. Induce the expression of the GOI with the addition of 200  μL 
IPTG ( see Note 11 ).
 7. Incubate at 16  °C overnight with continued agitation ( see

4 Notes
 1. Several stains may be used for expression, E. coli  BL21 was 
chosen for this protocol due to the relative ease of expression 
of large quantities of protein. Signal peptides from unrelated 
species (e.g., Bacteroidetes) have been validated in E. coli ; 
however, care should be taken to ensure that E. coli  is an appro -
priate species for expression. Signal peptides from gram-  
positive bacteria or Eukaryotes will require other expression 
systems and may necessitate expression in the native species.
 2. Several vectors are available for this purpose that may be more 
suitable depending on the protein and expression system cho -
sen. pET21b is chosen here due to the presence of a C-  terminal 
poly-histidine tag (HIS-tag), which minimizes potential inter -
actions with N-terminal signal peptides. Many other vectors 
contain N-terminal tags; however, care should be taken to 
avoid any manipulation 5 ′ of N-terminal signal peptides and 3 ′ 
of C-terminal signal peptides as this may obstruct interaction 
between the tag and associated proteins.
 3. Many techniques exist for the lysis of bacterial cells which may 
also be used including French-press, sonication, and lysis 
buffers including detergents, urea/guanidine-HCl, and/or 
Lysozyme. BugBuster® was chosen for this protocol because 
Targeting of Proteins Using Signal Peptides

proteins remain folded upon lysis and it does not solubilize 
protein aggregates (i.e., minimizes solubilization of mis -
folded proteins).
 4. These concentrations can be modified to alter how aggressively 
the outer membrane is lysed. Increasing the sucrose concentra -
tion to as much as 20% (w/v) and reducing the MgCl 2 concen -
tration to as little as 5  mM will result in the release of more 
periplasmic proteins. Care must be taken however, because 
these changes can also result in the release of some cytoplasmic 
proteins which will result in a false positive where proteins 
from the cytoplasm are found in the periplasmic fraction.
 5. Concentration of Proteinase K and length of incubation may 
need to be optimized for different proteins and different spe -
cies. These times and concentrations were found to adequate 
in our cases.
 6. Use of the vectors containing HIS-tags allows for the use of 
anti-His6 antibodies for all proteins which minimizes variabil -
ity between antibody binding. If vectors with no epitope tag or 
native protein expression are being evaluated, custom antibod -
ies will need to be generated.
 7. In the case of protein overexpression as presented here, a pri -
mary antibody conjugate is often sufficient. If difficult to express 
proteins or native expression is being evaluated, a secondary 
antibody conjugate should be used. In this case, prepare the 
secondary antibody in the same way as the primary antibody. 
After the application of primary antibody to the membrane, 
rinse thoroughly a minimum of twice before adding the sec -
ondary antibody solution. Rinse the membrane thoroughly 
again before adding the substrate.
 8. Depending on antibody conjugate chosen, this will be variable. 
Horse radish peroxidase conjugates and Opti-4CN™ substrate 
were chosen for its ease of use though other  conjugates and a 
variety of substrates are equally appropriate. If fluorescent con -
jugates are chosen, it must be established that the cells are not 
autofluorescent prior to use.
 9. Several techniques serve this purpose including chemically 
competent transformation or electroporation. It is imperative 
to ensure any cells not containing the vector and GOI are 
removed.
 10. Reducing the temperature of the culture may improve the 
expression of minimally soluble proteins [ 14]. Other tempera -
tures may prove useful such as 25  °C and 37  °C. If possible, 
expression should be carried out as close to physiological tem -
peratures as possible to ensure proper function of transporters 
and signal peptide associated proteins.

 11. This volume results in a final concentration of 200  μM. 
Concentrations between 100  μM and 1  mM may improve 
expression level and should be optimized.
 12. The supernatant from this step contains all soluble cellular 
protein which is important for demonstrating that the amount 
of protein found in periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions is 
consistent with total protein. The pellet that is formed can be 
resuspended in 250  μL of dH 2O and visualized. This can be 
particularly useful when over-expressing protein and expressing 
protein in nonnative species as appreciable amounts of protein 
may be lost to aggregates and inclusion bodies. If other tech -
niques are used to lyse the cells such as sonication or detergents, 
these aggregates may be solubilized and give an inaccurate 
picture as to how much functional protein is remaining in the 
cytoplasm.
 13. This sample contains periplasmic proteins and should be 
retained.
 14. This sample may be applied to Subheading 3.4 to determine if 
a protein is bound to the inner membrane and exposed within 
the periplasm.
 15. This sample contains cytoplasmic proteins and should be 
retained.
 16. Incomplete removal of the Proteinase K may cause the degra -
dation of antibody in later steps and result in inaccurate data.
 17. These solutions can be saved and reused as long as the mem -
branes were thoroughly washed prior to submersion. Improper 
washing may result in the release of live cells into the buffers, 
contaminating further experiments.
 18. Pictures should be taken as soon as the membranes dry. 
Membranes are stable in the dark for at least a few days but will 
eventually discolor and will quickly discolor in the light.

Analysis of  Complex Carbohydrate Composition  
in Plant Cell Wall Using Fourier Transformed  
Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR)
Ajay Badhan, Yuxi  Wang, and  Tim A. McAllister
Abstract
Fourier transformed mid-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a powerful tool for compositional analysis of plant 
cell walls (Acebes et  al., Front Plant Sci 5:303, 2014; Badhan et  al., Biotechnol Biofuels 7:1–15, 2014; 
Badhan et  al., BioMed Res Int 2015: 562952, 2015; Roach et  al., Plant Physiol 156:1351–1363, 2011). The 
infrared spectrum generates a fingerprint of a sample with absorption peaks corresponding to the frequency 
of vibrations between the bonds of the atoms making up the material. Here, we describe a method focused 
on the use of FTIR in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the composition 
of the plant cell wall. This method has been successfully used to study complex enzyme saccharification pro -
cesses like rumen digestion to identify recalcitrant moieties in low-quality forage which resist rumen digestion 
(Badhan et  al., BioMed Res Int 2015: 562952, 2015), as well as to characterize cell wall mutant lines or 
transgenic lines expressing exogenous hydrolases (Badhan et  al., Biotechnol Biofuels 7:1–15, 2014; Roach 
et al., Plant Physiol 156:1351–1363, 2011). The FTIR method described here facilitates high-throughput 
identification of the major compositional differences across a large set of samples in a low cost and 
nondestructive manner.

1 Introduction
The plant cell wall is a heterogeneous, complex matrix composed 
of different polymers like cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin [ 5]. 
In brief, cellulose can be described as a linear polymer of glucose 
connected via β-1, 4- linkages that form a flat, linear chain. Whereas 
the backbone of hemicellulose is composed of a variety of sugars 
(i.e., glucose, xylose, and mannose) with a number of different 
types of branches, while lignin is a complex polymer of aromatic 
alcohols that fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose, 
hemicellulose, and pectin [ 6–7]. Carbohydrate composition of the 
cell wall can be assayed with great precision by gas-  chromatography. 
210
However, it involves a series of labor intensive, long, and tedious 
solvent extraction steps to isolate different components of the cell 
wall and to derivatize them to alditol acetates, making this approach 
less favorable for studies with large sample sets. Infra-red spectros -
copy relies on absorption of the infra-red radiation by interatomic 
bonds. Absorption of incident infrared causes bonds to bend and 
vibrate. The frequency of vibration that corresponds to absorption 
can be detected and converted into spectrum by using Fourier 
transformed algorithms which represents the molecular architec -
ture of the sample. Furthermore, the combination of attenuated 
total reflection (ATR) with infrared spectroscopy allows biomass 
samples to be analyzed in its innate state without sample extensive 
preparation [ 8]. As Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy 
(FTIR) analysis does not involve extensive sample preparation and 
derivatization procedures, it allows for a high-throughput nonde -
structive and low-cost analysis of complex carbohydrate constitu -
ents and their organization within biomass as well as identification 
of functional groups including carboxylic esters, phenolics esters, 
protein amides, and carboxylic acids [ 9–10].
The spectral information generated from FTIR spectroscopy is 
generally complex and extensive, requiring sophisticated data 
reduction techniques such as principal component analysis. 
Principal component analysis can identify the most distinctive fea -
tures of the collected spectra and reduce the dimensionality of the 
data from several hundred data points in the original spectra to a 
fewer number of dimensions [ 11]. Alternatively, digital subtraction 
of averaged spectrum from different samples can provide valuable 
information regarding differences in cell wall composition. We were 
able to identify the abundance of undigested arabino-xylan and 
esterified hemicellulose components by differential spectral analysis 
of barley silage (feed) versus total track indigested fiber residue 
(isolated from fecal samples from cows fed a barley silage diet) by 
FTIR analysis (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1  FTIR spectral difference for feed versus tract indigested fiber residues (TIFR) showing major undigested 
plant cell wall components after rumen digestion. Barley silage was used as feed, whereas TIFR were recovered 
as NDF washed residual fiber from feces of cattle fed a barley silage based diet. Spectral difference peaks 
ranging between 1020 and 1130  cm−1 corresponded to undigested arabionoglucuronoxylan, xyloglucan, arabinan, 
and pectin and suggested an abundance of cross-linked hemicellulose within TIFR.  Likewise, cross-linked esteri -
fied xylan and pectin in undigested residue were evident at peak 1714  cm−1 (C=O from xylan) and 1738–
1747  cm−1 (unconjugated C=O stretch in xylan from acetic acid ester and pectin). Abundance of lignin in TIFR is 
evident by spectral differences at 1508, 1541, 1653, and 1688  cm−1

3 Methods
 1. Grind plant biomass using grinding mill to pass through a 
1 mm screen. Quick freeze the ground samples at −80 °C and 
lyophilize biomass samples for a week to remove moisture 
(see Notes 1  and 2).
 2. Take approximately 5  g of dried and ground sample for 
sequential extraction over a sintered glass funnel under vac -
uum with two volumes of 100  ml of ice cold 80% ethanol, 
100% ethanol, chloroform: methanol (1:1) mixture and 100% 
acetone ( see Notes 3  and 4).
 3. Dry the sample in fume hood at room temperature ( see Note 4 ).
 4. Prepare ammonium formate buffer (pH  6.0) by dissolving 
6.306  mg of ammonium formate into 500  ml of deionized 
water and adjust pH to 6.0 with formic acid. Add 1  ml of 20% 
sodium azide stock and make final volume to 1  L with deion -
ized water.
 5. De-starch samples by suspending 1 g dried biomass in 100  ml 
of 0.1  M ammonium formate buffer, pH  6.0. Add 25  μl of 
type-1 porcine α-amylase (50 Units per 100  mg cell wall) and 
incubate at 25  °C for 48  h with shaking at 110  rpm.
 6. Deactivate the amylase by incubating the reaction solution in 
water bath set at 95  °C for 15  min. Cool down the samples 
on ice and centrifuge at 900  × g for 10  min and discard 
supernatant.
 7. Wash pellet at least thrice with distilled water and twice with 
acetone to get rid of residual amylase. Allow samples to dry in 
a fume hood overnight.
 1. Open the instrument-operating software (Opus software). 
Clean the sample platform with tissue wipe and ethanol ( see 
Notes 5  and 6).
 2. Set up measurement parameters by clicking on Measurement 
icon to open Measurement menu. Name your sample using 
sample description function. Under the advanced setting, set 
the file name and path for the folder files for data to be stored, 
set the scan mode to transmittance and the scan range between 
4000 and 800  cm−1 with a resolution of 4  cm−1 and 32 repeti -
tious scans. Once completed, save and exit the settings mode.
 3. Click the measure icon once more. Acquire background spec -
trum by clicking start background scan and wait for back -
ground scanning to be completed as shown by the green bar at 
the bottom of the scan window ( see Note 7 ).
 4. Place the sample on the sample platform and close the sample 
holder so that the sample is in complete contact with ATR-  
Internal reflection element (IRE).3.1 Biomass

 5. Acquire sample spectra by clicking on Start sample measurement 
and wait till spectral acquisition is completed. Take at least 
three spectrums for each sample ( see Notes 8  and 9).
 6. Click on Manipulate menu and select base line correction 
followed by the normalization icon to perform baseline cor -
rection and spectra normalization.
 7. Save spectral data in excel file format (CSV) for further analysis. 
Select the data analysis approach that is appropriate to your goal.
 8. Copy paste all spectral data from excel files to a single excel file 
so that the combined data can be used as the input file for PCA 
analysis.
 9. Averaged spectra from two samples can be used for accessing 
digital subtraction spectra showing major compositional differ -
ences among two samples, as shown in Fig. 1. Spectral differ -
ence between feed (barley silage) and total tract undigested 
residue from fecal samples from cows fed a barley silage diet 
[3] identified esterified hemicellulose cross linked to lignin as a 
major recalcitrant component for rumen digestion (Fig. 1).
4 Notes
 1. Use of an oven to dry the samples should be avoided as this can 
change the structure and composition of the plant cell wall.
 2. The time for freeze drying varies depending on the sample and 
its source. Samples should be lyophilized for a prolonged 
period to ensure complete dryness.
 3. Chloroform is highly toxic by all exposure routes. Do not 
allow pregnant staff to handle chloroform. Avoid skin contact. 
Avoid breathing the vapor; all work should be conducted in a 
fume hood. Keep away from heat or naked flames.
 4. Always work with acetone in fume hood as vapors from it can 
cause dizziness. Never use oven to dry large sample set of 
acetone-  soaked biomass, as it can lead to an explosion. Always 
dry acetone washed samples in a hood overnight at room 
temperature.
 5. The crystal should be thoroughly cleaned and dried before 
acquiring background spectra.
 6. Do not use gloves when you touch keyboard or mouse to min -
imize contamination. Solvents should not be applied directly 
on the instrument as they can damage it; they should be first 
applied to a chem wipe that can be used to clean the crystal.
 7. Background spectrum should be taken before every sample. 
During background scanning the sample holder should be 
kept open.

Separation and  Visualization of  Glycans by Fluorophore-  
Assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis
Mélissa  Robb, Joanne  K. Hobbs, and  Alisdair  B. Boraston
Abstract
Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) is a method in which a fluorophore is covalently 
attached to the reducing end of carbohydrates, thereby allowing visualization following high-  resolution 
separation by electrophoresis. This method can be used for carbohydrate profiling and sequencing, as well as 
for the determination of the specificity of carbohydrate-active enzymes. Here, we describe and demonstrate 
the use of FACE to separate and visualize the glycans released following digestion of oligosaccharides by 
glycoside hydrolases (GHs) using two examples: (1) the digestion of chitobiose by the streptococcal 
β-hexosaminidase GH20C, and (2) the digestion of glycogen by the GH13 member SpuA.

1 Introduction
Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) is a 
sensitive, fast, and inexpensive electrophoretic method for carbo -
hydrate analysis [ 1–8]. Carbohydrates are covalently labeled at 
their reducing end using a fluorophore, such as 8-  aminonaphthale
ne- 1,3,6-trisulphonic acid (ANTS), and the resulting labeled sug -
ars are separated in a high percentage polyacrylamide gel. In con -
trast to proteins and DNA, oligosaccharides can be relatively small; 
therefore, the gel percentage required for separation is usually 
between 20 and 40%. Gels can be then visualized and imaged using 
a standard UV light imager. Given that a sugar must be charged to 
migrate during electrophoresis, the choice of fluorophore 
depends on the normal charge state of the sugar to be visualized. 
Many sugars found in human glycans–such as glucose, galactose, 
fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)–are uncharged; 
therefore, the fluorophore ANTS, which possesses three negative 
charges, is particularly suited to the labeling of these sugars. 
Other fluorophores suitable for use in FACE include 2-aminoac -
ridone (AMAC; uncharged) and sodium 4-amino-napthalene 
216
disulfonate (ANSA; singly charged) [ 7]. Separation of labeled 
mono- and oligosaccharides occurs on the basis of charge as well as 
size; therefore larger, more highly charged oligosaccharides may 
migrate faster than smaller, less charged sugars. In the case of fluo -
rophore-labeled uncharged sugars, the uniform charge state means 
that migration is based largely on hydrodynamic size [ 2]. 
Derivatization of carbohydrates with a FACE fluorophore occurs 
in two steps. First, the C1 aldehyde of the saccharide at the reduc -
ing end interacts with the primary amine of the fluorophore to 
create a Schiff base [ 9]. Second, using sodium cyanoborohydride, 
this base is reduced to the mixed aryl/aliphatic secondary stable 
amine [ 7]. Fluorophore labeling of glycans offers a high level of 
sensitivity, with reports of detection down in the low picomolar 
range [ 2, 7, 10]. This allows the use of relatively small amounts of 
oligosaccharides compared to other common methods of carbohy -
drate analysis, such as TLC and HPLC.
FACE has been used to perform oligosaccharide profiling and 
sequencing [ 3, 7, 11], as well as for the analysis of various types of 
carbohydrate moieties such as glycoproteins [ 12, 13], glycolipids 
[5, 14], plant and bacterial polysaccharides [ 6, 8, 15], and glycos -
aminoglycans [ 4, 16]. It can also be used to determine the activity 
and specificity of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) [ 17–
19]. Here, we describe the labeling, separation, and visualization 
of uncharged mono- and oligosaccharides with ANTS. We also 
demonstrate the use of FACE to assess the substrate and linkage 
specificity of glycoside hydrolases, using the digestion of chitobi -
ose and glycogen by the streptococcal enzymes GH20C and the 
GH13 member SpuA, respectively (Fig. 1).

10 mL water.
 8. FACE loading dye: Combine 310  μL stacking gel buffer, 
70 μL of BPB solution and 500  μL glycerol. Make up to 5  mL 
by adding 4.12  mL water.
3 Methods
 1. Prepare all carbohydrate stock solutions (e.g., 10  mM) in dH 2O.
 2. Set up the desired reactions/samples containing 10  μg carbohy -
drate ( see Note 4 ) in an appropriate buffer, plus enzyme if 
required, and incubate at an appropriate temperature for 1–20  h 
depending on the degree of digestion desired ( see Note 5 ).
 3. Stop the reactions by adding 0.5  mL ice cold 95% ethanol.
 4. Dry the samples in a speed vacuum for approximately 2  h at 
medium heat, until samples are completely dry.
 5. To label the dried samples, resuspend each sample in 5  μL 
fresh ANTS solution and 5  μL fresh NaBH 3CN solution by 
vortexing well.
 6. Briefly spin the samples to bring them to the bottom of the 
tube and incubate them overnight at 37  °C wrapped in foil.
 7. Dry the labeled samples in a speed vacuum for 2–4  h with 
suitable ventilation at medium heat or until completely dry 
(see Note 6 ).
 8. Resuspend the dried pellet in 25  μL FACE loading dye and 
run on gel immediately or store at −20 °C wrapped in foil 
(see Note 7 ).
 1. For two gels, mix 1.8  mL resolving buffer, 12.8  mL 40% acryl -
amide, and 75  μL 10% APS in a 50  mL Erlenmeyer and mix 
gently by swirling. Add 7.5  μL of TEMED, mix briefly and cast 
gels within 8  cm × 8 cm × 1 mm gel cassettes. Allow space for 
stacking gel, gently overlay with isopropanol, and allow to 
polymerize for at least 30  min ( see Notes 8  and 9).
 2. Prepare the stacking gel solution by mixing 1.0  mL stacking 
buffer, 1.9  mL 40% acrylamide solution, 4.8  mL water, and 
39 μL 10% APS in a 50  mL Erlenmeyer. Mix gently.
 3. Once the resolving gel is polymerized, remove the isopropanol, 
flush with water, and remove excess water by tapping upside 
down.
 4. Add 7.8  μL TEMED to the stacking solution mixture, mix gently, 
and quickly add on the top of the solidified resolving gel. 
Immediately add a 12-well gel comb without introducing air 
bubbles. Allow to polymerize for at least 30  min ( see Note 10 ).3.1 Carbohydrate

 5. When ready, carefully remove the comb and clean up any loose 
acrylamide from around the wells.
 6. Fill an ice box with ice and pack it around an empty gel tank.
 7. Put the gel(s) in the tank, fill the middle reservoir with running 
buffer, and pour the remainder of the buffer outside and over 
the electrodes.
 8. Flush the wells well with running buffer using a Pasteur pipette.
 9. Load the required volume of each sample onto the gel(s) 
(see Notes 11  and 12).
 10. Run the gel(s) for 30  min at 100  V followed by 1  h at 300  V 
(see Notes 13  and 14).
 11. Wet the surface of the UV lightbox with water, carefully open 
the gel cassette, and push the gel out from the bottom onto 
the imager, adding more water on the top of the gel to stop it 
from drying out ( see Notes 15–17 ).
 12. Image the gel and adjust the exposure adequately.
4 Notes
 1. The concentration of ANTS and NaBH 3CN used can be 
optimized to ensure efficient labeling while keeping the back -
ground fluorescence low. We have found that GlcNAc, and 
oligosaccharides with GlcNAc at the reducing end, require a 
higher concentration of ANTS and NaBH 3CN for labeling 
than other sugars, such as galactose and glucose. We routinely 
use 0.2  M ANTS and 1  M NaBH 3CN for labeling GlcNAc, 
and 1/10 these concentrations for all other sugars.
 2. Wear a face mask when weighing out NaBH 3CN and wear 
gloves when handling the solution.
 3. APS solution should be prepared fresh before each use or 
stored at −20 °C in aliquots. Thawed aliquots can be used for 
up to 1 week.
 4. How much carbohydrate is used depends on the availability 
and expense of the sugar, as well as the number of expected 
products of digestion. A minimum of 2.5  μg is suggested. For 
most sugars that are a hexasaccharide or smaller, we have found 
10 μg to be a suitable amount. Up to 100  μg may be required 
for large polysaccharides, especially if they are expected to be 
digested into many different sized products.
 5. The duration of incubation depends on the amount of enzyme 
used and the degree of digestion desired. We have found that 
complete digestion is typically achieved following 20  h incubation 
with 1  μM enzyme.

 6. When 0.2  M ANTS is used for labeling, the dried pellet 
obtained should be large and yellow.
 7. After resuspending the pellet with the FACE loading dye, the 
samples will become blue-green in color (depending on 
the amount of ANTS used). Following storage at −20 °C, the 
samples will turn yellow but this does not affect their use in 
any way.
 8. Because of the high acrylamide concentration of these gels, we 
find it is best to make them fresh before each experiment as 
they tend to dry out.
 9. Overlaying the resolving gel with isopropanol prevents contact 
with atmospheric oxygen (which inhibits acrylamide polymer -
ization) and helps to level the resolving gel.
 10. Provided the stacker has fully polymerized, we do not suggest 
waiting more than 1  h to run gels as we have found that they 
dry out quickly resulting in a poor quality gel image.
 11. The volume of each sample that should be loaded depends on 
the concentration of the sugar in the reaction and its molecular 
weight. For reactions containing 10  μg sugar and resuspended 
in 25  μL loading dye, we suggest loading 1  μL for mono-, di-, 
and trisaccharides, and 2–5  μL for larger sugars.
 12. Avoid using the outer most two wells on each end as the gels 
tend to “smile.”
 13. The current at 300  V should be around 20–25  mA (for one gel).
 14. Depending on the volume of sample loaded, it may or may not 
be visible as it migrates through the gel. For samples labeled 
with 0.2  M ANTS, a yellow band corresponding to excess 
ANTS should be visible approx. two-thirds of the way down 
the gel after running. If you are not sure if your samples have 
fully resolved, the gel can be visualized under UV while still in 
the cassette and run for longer if necessary.
 15. If running two gels simultaneously, visualize them one at a time 
as they tend to dry out. While imaging one gel, leave the other 
in its cassette and place it in a large beaker or container filled 
with the used running buffer to avoid it from drying out.
 16. If the corners of the gel curl up, flood the surface of the gel 
with water and lay a glass plate on the top with no air bubbles, 
then visualize.
 17. Depending on the amount of ANTS used during labeling, a 
bright band corresponding to excess ANTS may be observed 
toward the bottom of the gel. This can interfere with the 
visualization of the gel by creating too much background 
noise; if so, this part of the gel can be cut off and discarded 
prior to imaging.

A Rapid Procedure for  the Purification of  8-Aminopyrene 
Trisulfonate (APTS)-Labeled Glycans for  Capillary

Abstract
Purified glycan standards are required for glycan arrays, characterizing substrate specificities of glycan-  active 
enzymes, and to serve as retention-time or mobility standards for various separation techniques. This chapter 
describes a method for the rapid separation, and subsequent desalting, of glycans labeled with the highly 
fluorescent fluorophore 8-aminopyrene 1,3,6-trisulfonate (APTS). By using fluorophore-assisted carbohy -
drate electrophoresis (FACE) on polyacrylamide gels, which utilizes equipment readily available in most 
molecular biology laboratories, many APTS-labeled glycans can be simultaneously resolved. Excising spe -
cific gel bands containing the desired APTS-labeled glycans, followed by glycan elution from the gel and 
subsequent solid-phase extraction (SPE), yields single glycan species free of excess labeling reagents and 
buffer components. This chapter describes a FACE/SPE procedure ideal for preparing glycans for capillary 
electrophoresis (CE)-based enzyme assays, as well as for the purification of rare, commercially unavailable 
glycans from tissue culture samples.

1 Introduction
The development of techniques to identify and quantitate glycan 
structures present in biological samples is essential if continued 
advancements in the field of glycoscience are to be realized [ 1]. 
Electrophoretic separation methods are inherently well suited for 
separating very polar analytes, such as glycans. In past decades, 
capillary electrophoresis (CE) has emerged as a popular complement 
to existing chromatographic methods [ 2]. When applied to the anal -
ysis of glycans, CE has consistently demonstrated very high separa -
tion efficiencies, often resolving isomeric structures. CE’s outstanding 
resolving power is in part owed to the fact that peak broadening, 
which results from multiple available pathways through the packing 
material of liquid chromatography columns (i.e., eddy diffusion), 
does not occur in the open tubular capillaries utilized by CE.  These 
capillary tubes also lack stationary phase particles, permitting the 
direct injection of glycans from enzyme-  containing reaction mix -
tures that would otherwise plug common chromatography columns. 
This feature allows for the characterization of glycan-active enzymes, 
or the structural elucidation of glycans, by exo-glycosidase sequenc -
ing. Another advantage of CE-based enzyme assays is that minimal 
sample injection volumes are required (low nanoliter range), allow -
ing for repeat assay analysis. Thus, CE’s powerful resolution, high 
separation efficiency, ability to rapidly resolve glycans in enzyme- 
and buffer-containing mixtures, and low sample consumption make 
CE an attractive technique for characterizing the substrate specifici -
ties of glyco-  active enzymes [ 3–7].
In nearly all cases, CE analysis of glycans borne by glycopro -
teins requires either their chemical or enzymatic release from the 
protein component (Fig. 1a). Glycans N-linked to asparagine resi -
dues of glycoproteins are readily liberated using commercially 
available enzymes such as peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF). 
PNGaseF initially produces glycosylamine products that, in neutral 
solution, rapidly hydrolyze to yield free reducing sugars [ 8]. These 
sugars can then be labeled with aldehyde-reactive chromophores 
or fluorophores, permitting their detection by various optical tech -
niques [ 9]. Unlike the case of N-linked glycans, analysis of glycans 
O-linked to serine or threonine residues is hampered by the lack of 
a general O-glycanase enzyme; thus, chemical deglycosylation 
strategies must be employed to obtain these analytes. One of the 
more widely used techniques to chemically cleave O-linked glycans 
from their serine or threonine glycoprotein anchors is an ammonia-  
based β-elimination reaction [ 10]. This method, although time-  
consuming and dependent on fastidious desalting, nevertheless 
yields reducing glycans amenable to fluorophore derivatization.
Currently, the fluorophore most widely used for CE glycan analy -
sis is 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (APTS; Fig. 1a) [11–15].

APTS contains three sulfonate groups, which ensures that the 
labeled glycan species will uniformly possess a net negative charge 
regardless of whether the parent glycan is charged or neutral. APTS 
is among the brightest of all glycan derivatization reagents with a 
λEX of 455  nm—close to the output (488  nm) of an argon ion laser 
that is commonly used by CE.  Low attomole detection limits have 
been achieved for APTS-labeled glycans using CE instruments 
Fig. 1  Overview of the FACE/SPE glycan purification method. ( a) Protein-linked 
glycans must be cleaved from proteins and purified before labeling with APTS; for 
N-linked glycans this is routinely accomplished by peptide N-glycanase F 
(PNGaseF) digestion while ammonia-catalyzed β-elimination may be used to 
obtain reducing O-glycans. CE analysis is performed to initially characterize the 
APTS-labeled glycans. ( b) Several glycan samples may be separated in parallel by 
fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) on polyacrylamide slab 
gels. Resolved glycans may be visualized using a UV transilluminator and specific 
glycans of interest are cut out of the gels using a scalpel. These gel slices are 
placed in centrifuge tubes and immersed in water to elute the APTS-  labeled 
glycans, which are rapidly desalted using solid-phase extraction cartridges 
containing porous graphitized carbon. Glycans purified in this way are amenable 
to sensitive CE-based assays

equipped with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detectors [ 14]. 
APTS-labeled glycans have been resolved by both capillary zone 
electrophoresis [ 11, 12] and capillary gel electrophoresis [ 13–15]. 
They may also be resolved on polyacrylamide gels using electro -
phoresis equipment widely available in a molecular biology labora -
tory [ 16, 17]. This separation of fluorescently labeled glycans by 
slab gel electrophoresis is commonly known as fluorophore-assisted 
carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE)—a technique that has been 
successfully applied to analyze diverse sets of glycan samples 
[18–20].
Here, we present a simple and inexpensive method in which 
FACE is used to separate and purify APTS-labeled glycans (Fig. 1b). 
In short, FACE-resolved glycans are visualized on a UV transillu -
minator, allowing for the excision of specific gel bands and subse -
quent elution of the glycans of interest. Solid-phase extraction 
(SPE) conducted using porous graphitized carbon (PGC) SPE car -
tridges subsequently yields pure, salt-free, APTS-labeled glycans. 
Glycans of interest are physically retained on the SPE cartridge 
through strong electrostatic interactions between PCG and the 
APTS label. In order to effectively release APTS-labeled glycans 
from the PCG SPE cartridges, eluents containing millimolar (mM) 
concentrations of a strong, volatile ion-pairing reagent, such as 
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), are required. We have employed this 
FACE/SPE procedure to remove derivatization reagents and 
excess APTS from commercially available N-glycan standards to 
assess the substrate specificity of bacterial glycosidases (Fig. 2) [4]. 
This FACE/SPE purification method has also been used success -
fully to purify commercially unavailable O- and N-linked glycans 
produced in tissue cultured mammalian cell lines (Fig. 3) [3]. Rapid 
CE-based exo-glycosidase assays were used to confirm the structures 
of these glycans—these assays do not require any sample cleanup, and 
can be injected directly into the CE from reaction vials. By using 
FACE/SPE-purified glycans in these exo-  glycosidase assays, the sub -
strate—product relationships are made very clear, as there is no over -
lap between glycosidase digestion products and glycans that may 
have been present in the initial sample upon subsequent CE analysis. 
Hence, this simple and inexpensive FACE/SPE procedure allows for 
both the rapid purification of APTS-labeled glycans from a variety of 
sources in addition to enabling the establishment of glycan structures 
by CE-based exo-glycosidase sequencing.

residue ( i and ii, respectively). However, pretreatment of glycans with an α1,2/3-mannosidase ( iii) formed a 
glycan (M2a) in which the remaining α1,6-linked mannose residue could be efficiently hydrolyzed by SpGH125 
(iv) and CpGH125 ( v). (c) Structure of an intact high mannose N-linked glycan. The symbols are recommended

Fig. 3  FACE/SPE permits the purification of rare, commercially unavailable glycans from proteins secreted by cell 
cultured cells or from cell lysates and allows them to be used in CE-based glycosidase assays. ( a) Developmentally 
important O-linked glycans borne on a recombinantly produced portion of the cell surface receptor Notch [ 3] were 
released by β-elimination and derivatized with APTS ( i). A trisaccharide ( ii) of the same mobility as a chemically 
synthesized standard, D-Xyl- α1-3-D-Xyl- α-1-3-D-Glc (XXG; vi), was purified by FACE/SPE and spiked with malt -
ose (iii) as an internal standard (i.s.). α-Xylosidase (XylS) digestion and chemically defined standards were used 
to confirm the structure of XXG by CE.  After a 3  h reaction with XylS, XXG was completely converted into XG ( iv). 
Tris, a buffer salt used in the FACE purification procedure, completely blocks the ability of XylS to cleave the sec -
ond xylose residue from XG; however, purification by SPE permits complete hydrolysis of XXG into APTS-labeled 
glucose (G; v) which was confirmed based on its co-migration with a FACE-purified standard ( vii). (b) CE analysis 
of the N-linked glycans from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells grown in the absence ( i) or presence ( ii) of 
castanospermine demonstrated that this inhibitor blocked the processing of these glycans by endoplasmic reticu -
lum (ER) glucosidase I and II.  These glucosylated glycans (GlcNAc 2Man 9Glc 1-3; G1-G3) cannot currently be pur -
chased. G1–G3 were individually purified by FACE/SPE ( iii, only G3 is shown) and mixed together ( iv) to have their 
structures confirmed by exo-glycosidase sequencing. ER glucosidase I removes a single α1,2-linked Glc residue 
from G3, leaving G2 and G1 intact ( v). In contrast, G3 is protected from hydrolysis by an α1,3-glucosidase 
(Megazyme, Chicago, IL, USA) while G1 and G2 are converted into G0 ( vi). The identity of G0 was confirmed based 
on its susceptibility to jack bean mannosidase and also its co-migration with a commercially available standard 
(not shown). ( c) Structures of glycan standards.

3 Methods
Pure glycans, such as those commercially available (Fig. 2), may be 
directly labeled with APTS and purified by FACE. If glycoproteins 
or cell lysates are to be used as a source of glycan standards, the 
glycans must first be removed from proteins and desalted before 
they are fluorescently labeled, as excess salt and protein will impair 
the derivatization procedure. Methods are listed for preparing 
both N- and O-linked glycans from cell culture lines.
 1. Grow the cells until they are about 80% confluent.
 2. Aspirate the media and wash the cells with 2  × 5 mL 4  °C PBS.
 3. Add 1  mL 4 °C PBS to the plates and use a cell scraper to 
remove the adherent cells from the plate. Pellet the cells by 
centrifugation (800  × g, 5 min, 4  °C), then remove the PBS.
 4. Suspend cells in 180  μL PBS and add 20  μL 10× glycoprotein 
denaturing buffer (supplied with the PNGaseF deglycosylation 
kit; see Note 4 ).
 5. Remove an aliquot and heat at 100  °C for 10  min to denature 
the proteins.
 6. Allow samples to cool and add 1/10th volume 10% NP40.
 7. Add 1–5  μL PNGaseF and digest at 37  °C overnight. Digestion 
may be extended after the addition of fresh PNGaseF if 
necessary.
 8. Precipitate proteins by adding 3 volumes of ice cold ethanol. 
Store samples for 30  min at −20 °C.
 9. Pellet proteins by centrifugation (14,000  × g, 10 min, 4  °C); 
N-glycans are contained in the supernatant, which should be 2.5 SPE of  APTS-

transferred into clean centrifuge tubes, concentrated on a 
SpeedVac concentrator for several hours, snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen, and subsequently lyophilized ( see Note 5 ).
 10. Resuspend the dried glycans in 100  μL H 2O, and then desalt 
on PGC SPE cartridges. Cartridges must first be conditioned 
by sequentially washing with 1  mL 1  M NaOH, 2  mL H 2O, 
1 mL 30% AcOH, 2  mL H 2O, 1 mL elution solvent, and 3  mL 
H2O before applying glycan samples. After applying samples 
the SPE cartridges are sequentially washed with 1  mL H 2O, 
1 mL wash solvent, and eluted with 4  × 0.5 mL elution sol -
vent. Filter all eluates through a syringe filter to remove small 
pieces of the graphite SPE material.
 11. Concentrate samples on a SpeedVac to approximately 100–
150 μL, transfer to 200  μL tubes, snap freeze and lyophilize 
the desalted glycan samples. Once dry, samples are ready for 
APTS-labeling.
 1. Prepare cells as described above (Subheading 3.1.1 , steps 1–3 ); 
pellet the washed cells in a screw-cap micro centrifuge tube 
(see Note 6 ).
 2. In a fume hood, add 500  μL ammonium hydroxide saturated with 
ammonium carbonate. Add 50  mg of additional ammonium 
carbonate and tightly cap tubes. Briefly (5  min) heat (60  °C) to 
dissolve ammonium carbonate. Vortex vigorously, and sonicate 
until cell pellets are completely suspended ( see Note 7 ).
 3. Incubate at 60  °C for 40  h to completely β-eliminate glycans 
(see Note 8 ).
 4. Cool tubes ( −20 °C) for 30  min to reduce the pressure. Add 
0.5 mL H 2O and dry using a SpeedVac. Repeat several times to 
remove the majority of ammonium salts ( see Note 9 ).
 5. Resuspend pellet in 100–200  μL H 2O, pellet insoluble mate -
rial by centrifugation (14,000  × g, 5 min, room temperature), 
and desalt the glycan-containing supernatant by SPE 
(Subheading 3.1.1 , steps 10  and 11).
 1. To each dried sample, add 2  μL 50 mM APTS in 15% AcOH, 
then 2  μL 1 M NaBH 3CN in THF ( see Note 10 ).
 2. Incubate at 60  °C for 4  h in the dark ( see Note 11 ).
 1. Assemble gel-casting apparatus.
 2. Prepare 20% acrylamide resolving gel solution by mixing the 
following stock solutions: 1  mL 8× resolving gel buffer, 3  mL 
water, and 4  mL 40% acrylamide solution. Initiate polymeriza -
tion by adding 20  μL APS and 20  μL TEMED; these volumes 
are sufficient for preparing two mini gels. Mix well, and immedi -
ately pipette into the casting apparatus. Overlay the gel solution 
with 1 mL ethanol. Allow 30–60  min for polymerization.3.1.2  O-Linked Glycans

 3. Prepare stacking gel solution by mixing the following stock 
solutions: 0.25  mL 8× stacking gel buffer, 1.5  mL water, and 
0.25 mL 40% acrylamide solution. Initiate polymerization 
by adding 6  μL APS and 5  μL TEMED; these volumes are 
sufficient for preparing two stacking gels.
 4. Pour off the ethanol overlay from the resolving gel. Rinse well 
with 18  MΩ H 2O. Add the stacking gel solution and insert 
comb immediately. Polymerization of the stacking gel is usually 
complete within 15–30  min.
 5. Assemble the electrophoresis apparatus and add 1× FACE 
running buffer. This buffer should be prepared in advance and 
chilled to 4  °C.
 6. Mix the APTS-labeled glycan samples with an equal volume of 
2× FACE loading buffer. With care up to 15  μL of each sample 
can be loaded per well ( see Notes 12  and 13).
 7. Connect to an appropriate power supply and run at a constant 
voltage of 200  V at 4  °C in the dark ( see Note 14 ).
 8. Disconnect the power supply, remove the gel, and take off the 
top glass plate. Place FACE gel, glass side down, on a UV trans -
illuminator and visualize using the long wave (360  nm) setting. 
Using a clean scalpel, mark the position of APTS-  labeled glycan 
bands to be excised ( see Notes 14–16 ).
 9. Switch off the UV and quickly cut out the marked glycans, 
transferring each into a 1.5  mL centrifuge tube ( see Notes 17  
and 18).
 10. Completely immerse the gel slices in H 2O. Allow APTS-  labeled 
glycans to elute at 4  °C overnight in the dark.
 11. Centrifuge samples to pellet pieces of polyacrylamide gel. The 
supernatant, containing APTS-labeled glycans may be desalted 
without further sample concentration.
 1. Desalt the APTS-labeled glycans on conditioned PGC SPE 
cartridges. These should be conditioned by sequentially wash -
ing with 1  mL 1  M NaOH, 2  mL H 2O, 1 mL 30% AcOH, 
2 mL H 2O, 1 mL elution solvent, and 3  mL H 2O before apply -
ing APTS-labeled glycan samples. SPE cartridges are washed 
with 1  mL H 2O, and glycan samples are eluted with 4  × 0.5 mL 
elution solvent (use less elution solvent if possible). Filter all 
eluates through a syringe filter to remove small pieces of the 
graphite SPE material ( see Notes 19  and 20).
 2. Concentrate eluted samples on a SpeedVac to approximately 
25–50  μL, transfer to 200  μL tubes, then snap freeze and 
lyophilize the desalted APTS-labeled glycan samples. Exposure 
of the samples to light should be minimized.
 3. Resuspend the sample in 100  μL H 2O. The samples are ready 
for capillary electrophoresis analysis ( see Note 21 ).3.4 Desalting Using

4 Notes
 1. Methods have been described elsewhere for using DNA 
sequencers for the analysis of APTS-labeled glycans [ 22].
 2. Other CE buffers may be used. In our experience, the N-linked 
carbohydrate separation gel buffer (Beckman-Coulter) pro -
duces the best peak resolution.
 3. Do not use a micropipette to dispense concentrated TFA.
 4. The PNGaseF deglycosylation kit (New England Biolabs) is 
supplied with a 10× protein denaturing buffer and 10% NP-40 
(a nonionic detergent). Protocols for the use of this kit have 
been optimized for purified glycoproteins. For the PNGaseF 
digestion of cell lysates, it may be preferable to sonicate cell 
pellets in PBS containing 0.5% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), 
and then denature at 100 °C after adding 1/10th volume of 
400 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). NP-40 should be added to the 
denatured proteins to a final concentration of 1% before add -
ing the PNGaseF.  More thorough deglycosylation protocols 
amenable to tissues have been published elsewhere [ 23].
 5. The concentration of ethanol must be reduced before samples 
are lyophilized to prevent thawing.
 6. The ammonia-catalyzed β-elimination procedure produces sig -
nificant pressure. The use of screw-cap tubes prevents the lids 
from popping open during this procedure.
 7. Larger cell samples tend to form an insoluble residue if care is 
not taken to ensure that they are initially suspended in the 
ammonium hydroxide/ammonium carbonate mixture.
 8. These conditions will also eliminate N-linked glycans, although 
at lower yields than those obtained using PNGaseF [ 24]. 
Nevertheless, β-elimination is easily scaled up to accommodate 
larger samples than the enzymatic procedure.
 9. When removing ammonium salts from the samples, a cold trap 
should be used between the pump and SpeedVac. Alternatively, 
the pump exhaust should be vented into a fume hood.
 10. If the 1  M NaBH 3CN solution is to be prepared from the pure 
reagents, care should be taken as this process may produce toxic 
HCN gas. NaBH 3CN should be weighed in a fume hood. A 1  M 
solution in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) will also yield repro -
ducibly labeled glycans. This reagent may be stored at −20 °C; 
however, a fresh solution is typically prepared after one month.
 11. APTS-labeled glycans are stable for years if they are properly 
stored at −20 °C with minimal light exposure.
 12. It is advisable to load alternating wells in the gel to eliminate 
possible contamination due to the horizontal diffusion of 
APTS-labeled glycans when excising bands.
FACE Clean-Up of Glycans for CE

 13. Detection limits using UV transilluminators for visualization 
are substantially higher than those obtained by CE-LIF.  Thus, 
it is advisable to run mobility markers, such as dextran oligo -
mers, on the outer lanes of the FACE gels. A mobility marker 
will permit the approximate position of a glycan to be deter -
mined even if it is not readily visualized using the transillumi -
nator. We use a dextran ladder ranging from 1 to approximately 
30 glucose units (Beckman-Coulter, part number: 477613); 
other glucose polymers such as a 0.1  M HCl hydrolysate of 
starch may also be used.
 14. Excess APTS will be both the furthest migrating and most 
intense band on the gel, unless it has been run off completely. 
If present, this band must be removed immediately to prevent 
it from diffusing into the thin layer of running buffer between 
the gel and the glass plate.
 15. Protective equipment, such as a UV face shield, should be 
worn to prevent skin exposure to the UV light from the transil -
luminator. A lab coat or long-sleeved shirt is recommended to 
reduce UV forearm exposure as well.
 16. While cutting out the bands, the FACE gel should remain on 
whichever glass plate it resides post gel-apparatus disassembly; gel 
transfer will introduce water between the plate and gel  surface, 
which will begin to elute and mix the APTS-labeled glycans.
 17. Minor changes in the relative order of glycan migration times 
have been observed when comparing the FACE and CE sepa -
rations. For complex cell-derived samples, it is advisable to 
remove several extra glycan bands on either side of the glycan 
of interest.
 18. Glycans should be excised from FACE gels as quickly as possible 
to minimize their diffusion after electrophoresis. As the gels 
continue to sit, they will dry out and curl along their edges, 
making it very difficult to accurately excise the desired glycan 
bands. In addition, dry gels begin to crumble, and become 
very difficult to pick up with forceps.
 19. Glycine present in the FACE running buffer neutralizes the 
TFA required to elute APTS-labeled glycans from the graphite 
SPE cartridges. Thus, instances where large pieces of gel were 
used to obtain glycans may require eluent containing up to 
250 mM TFA to counteract this glycine neutralizing effect.
 20. Samples eluted from SPE may be stored in liquid nitrogen, 
while the other samples are still being prepared, in order to 
avoid the hydrolysis of acid labile glycans. Sialic acids residues 
are preserved if care is taken to ensure immediate freezing of 
the samples after elution.
 21. A freeze-dryer with a −84 °C cold trap is recommended for 
lyophilizing solutions containing ACN and TFA.

Abstract
The various modules in multimodular carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) may function in catalysis, 
carbohydrate binding, protein-protein interactions or as linkers. Here, we describe how combining the 
biophysical techniques of Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and macromolecular X-ray crystallography 
(XRC) provides a powerful tool for examination into questions related to overall structural organization 
of ultra multimodular CAZymes.

1 Introduction
Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) often have the interest -
ing feature of being multimodular, multifunctional assemblages. 
That is, they are composed of an independently folded catalytic 
module appended to one or more discretely folded modules within 
a contiguous amino acid sequence. This assembly is believed to be 
required to tackle recalcitrant, complex, and often solid substrates 
within their natural context. These additional modules, also 
referred to as auxiliary modules, retain their function when pro -
duced recombinantly as independent modular entities. CAZyme 
catalytic modules may function as glycoside hydrolases, glycosyl 
transferases, polysaccharide lyases, or lytic oxygenases; auxiliary 
modules may function as linkers, carbohydrate binding modules 
(CBMs) or for recruitment of other enzymes through protein-  
protein interactions (non-exhaustive list). Ultra multimodular 
240
CAZymes are considered here as enzymes having three or more 
independently folded modules.
Structural characterization using X-ray crystallography (XRC) 
has been indispensable for understanding the fine molecular deter -
minants of interaction, such as between catalytic modules and sub -
strate or carbohydrate binding modules and ligand. The 
determination of modular structure and function provides insight 
into the role of the individual modules but it does not provide an 
understanding of how these modules are coordinated spatially to 
one another and the implications on full-length enzyme function -
ality with substrate. Further complexities arise in determining the 
overall X-ray crystal structures of enzymes that are ultra multimod -
ular. Producing the full-length proteins recombinantly is challeng -
ing; they are large (often over 100  kDa) and may be prone to 
proteolysis. Crystal formation, required for structural characteriza -
tion by XRC, is quite challenging for full-length ultra multimodu -
lar CAZymes presumably in part due to flexibility between the 
modules. Although several full-length (or near full-length) ultra 
multimodular CAZyme structures have been determined using 
XRC [ 1–7], these remain the exception, not the rule.
XRC and low-resolution structural methods (such as cryo-  
electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic 
force microscopy, electron tomography) can be complementary in 
determining the overall structure of proteins and their complexes. 
A particularly powerful combination is between XRC and the low-  
resolution solution structure method Small Angle X-ray Scattering 
(SAXS) (Fig. 1). In general, high-resolution X-ray crystal struc -
tures of the individual modules are fit into the low-resolution SAXS 
molecular envelopes (~12–20  Å) generating pseudo-atomic reso -
lution models of the ultra multimodular enzymes and their com -
plexes [ 8–11]. Determining ultra multimodular protein structures 
using the combination of XRC and SAXS is an emerging frontier 
in structural biology research, providing important fundamental 
insights into full-length CAZymes with industrial, biomedical, and 
environmental significance.
Performing the pseudo-atomic resolution structural analysis of 
ultra multimodular CAZymes can be done using a “dissect and 
build” approach. This approach involves producing different single 
and multimodular protein constructs from the CAZyme of interest 
(dissect) and then piecing them together to obtain the full-length 
structure (build). The development of this methodology was first 
performed on the complex binding interactions in the cellulosome, 
a multi-protein, multimodular CAZyme complex produced by 
environmental bacteria for the efficient degradation of cellulose 
[12]. Here, a minimalist cellulosome-like structure was constructed 
to simplify SAXS data interpretation [ 13]. Further expansion and 
development of the “dissect and build” methodology has been 
done on the ultra multimodular CAZymes produced by Clostridium

perfringens , a bacterial pathogen, with a seminal paper on the 
methodology published in 2009 [ 14]. Clostridium perfringens , a 
notorious bacterial pathogen, produces an array of secreted ultra 
multimodular CAZymes with exquisite specificities for animal 
extracellular glycans; among these are the μ-toxin (GH84A, NagH, 
1627 amino acids) [ 15] and GH84C (NagJ, 1001 amino acids) 
(Fig. 2a). GH84C, having only four modules, is one of the “sim -
pler” ultra multimodular CAZymes produced by the organism, con -
sisting of an N-terminal glycoside hydrolase catalytic module 
(GH84C_cat) [ 16], a family 32 carbohydrate binding module 
(CBM32) [ 17], a cohesin module implicated in ultratight protein-  
protein interactions with its μ-toxin dockerin module binding part -
ner [( 18),] and a C-terminal FN3 module of unknown function [ 14]. 
Recombinant protein-production trials were unsuccessful for 
full-length GH84C and thus the “dissect and build” methodology 
combining XRC and SAXS was essential for the determination of the 
full-length pseudo-atomic resolution structure of GH84C and the 
interaction with the μ-toxin via the cohesin:dockerin interaction.
Fig. 1  Schematic representation of an experimental setup for SAXS experiments. From left to right: The inci -
dent X-ray beam is guided onto the capillary containing the sample solution, the rays are diffused and mea -
sured by transmission on an X-ray sensitive bidimensional detector. Then the 2D image of diffuse scattering is 
integrated in a radial manner leading to the experimental scattering curve. The scattering is measured as well 
for a buffer only solution ( red) before and/or after the sample solution ( blue) and the buffer signal is subse -
quently subtracted. The buffer-subtracted scattering curve is the starting point of all subsequent data analyses 
that may consist in fitting of the experimental curve with structural models. Since the scattering curve is 
registered in reciprocal space, to interpret a scattering profile in terms of a structure, it is useful to Fourier 
transform the scattering profile to obtain the interatomic distance distribution function, P(r) (also referred to as 
the pair distance or vector length distribution function)
Complex Architecture of Multimodular CAZymes 
242
In this chapter, the “dissect and build” methodology will be 
described for generating a full-length pseudo-atomic structure for 
the CAZyme GH84C and how to demonstrate the protein-protein 
interaction between the GH84C cohesin module and the dockerin 
module from GH84A.  This protocol assumes the reader has puri -
fied protein samples of the different modular constructs and PDB 
coordinates for these modules obtained via XRC. The purpose of 
this protocol is to serve as a basis for performing similar structural 
characterizations of multimodular enzymes using the complimen -
tary methods of XRC and SAXS.

3 Methods
 1. Produce and purify the different modular constructs as fresh as 
possible using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and 
size exclusion chromatography into 50  mM Tris pH  7.5 and 
100 mM NaCl ( see Note 3 ).
 2. Concentrate the purified multimodular protein constructs to 
~ 10 mg/ml and buffer exchange the modular constructs into 
1 L of 50  mM Tris pH  7.5 and 100  mM NaCl for 24  h, set 
aside 100  ml of the dialysate buffer ( see Notes 4–7 ). Analyze 
purity and protein quality using SDS-PAGE and dynamic light 
scattering (DLS) to assess monodispersity of the sample in 
solution. The DLS analysis should display a single peak cor -
responding to the monodisperse non-aggregated form of the 
molecules in the solution. Determine exact protein concentra -
tions using UV absorbance and calculated extinction coeffi -
cients [ 21].
 3. For preparing the protein-protein interacting complex, mix 
the two purified polypeptide constructs CBM32-Cohesin and 
FIVAR-Dockerin with FIVAR-Dockerin in ~1.5  M excess. 
Incubate overnight at 4  °C and then purify the complex in 
50 mM Tris pH  7.5 and 100  mM NaCl using SEC to a final 
concentration of 10  mg/ml and a final volume of 200  μL.3.1 Sample

 1. Beamline setup (this should be discussed with the beamline 
operator before the start of the experiment). The following 
beamline setup may be used: wavelength of 1.127  Å, a sample 
to detector distance of 1.7  m, and a data collection series of at 
least 10 frames with 3  s exposures.
 2. First collect SAXS data on standards. Collect SAXS data on dif -
ferent concentrations of standard solutions from 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 
and 10  mg/ml samples in 50  mM Tris pH  7.5 and 100  mM 
NaCl for both BSA and hen egg white lysozyme (Fig. 1). 
Collect data on buffer only sample as well, which will be sub -
tracted from the sample curves to account for background 
scattering. In addition, collecting a scattering curve on water is 
important for calibration and allows the calculation of absolute 
values of intensity at zero scattering. Volumes will vary depend -
ing on the beamline.
 3. Collect SAXS data on samples: GH84C_cat-CBM32 (Fig. 2c- I), 
CBM32-Cohesin (Fig. 2c–II), GH84C_cat-CBM32-  Cohesin 
(Fig. 2c–III), and the CBM32-Cohesin:FIVAR-Dockerin com -
plex (Fig. 2c–IV). Collect SAXS data on 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10  mg/
ml concentrations for all samples in 50  mM Tris pH  7.5 and 
100 mM NaCl ( see Notes 8–10 ). In between each sample collect 
buffer measurements for subtraction (just 50  mM Tris pH  7.5 
and 100  mM NaCl), for example: buffer measurement, 1  mg/ml 
sample collection, buffer measurement, 2  mg/ml sample col -
lection, buffer measurement, 4  mg/ml sample collection, buffer 
measurement, 6  mg/ml sample collection, buffer measurement,

To determine the spatial relationship between CBM32 and 
Cohesin, perform SAXS analysis of CBM32-Cohesin,  GH84C_
cat- CBM32-  Cohesin and of the CBM32-Cohesin:FIVAR-  
Dockerin complex.
 1. Initial examination and buffer subtraction of the curves should 
be done using the program PRIMUS [ 22] or equivalent 
(see Note 11 ). After the buffer subtracted scattering curves 
have been determined, the plots of I(q) vs q at each concentra -
tion should be identical, where I(q) is the scattered intensity 
and q is the scattering vector or momentum transfer with the 
units Å−1 (defined q=4πsinθ, where 2 θ is the scattering angle). 
Use the buffer subtracted curves for all further analyses. These 
files are in ASCII format and generally have the extension 
name.dat.
 2. Determine Rg and I(0) using the Guinier approximation in 
PRIMUS.  There are two size and shape parameters for the 
scattering particle that can be easily calculated: the first is I(0), 3.2 SAXS Data

the intensity at which q is equal to 0, the second is the radius 
of gyration, Rg, the square root of the average squared distance 
of each scatterer from the center of the particle [ 23]. At small 
values of q (that is at low scattering angles) the Guinier approx -
imation [lnI( q)=lnI(0)  − q2Rg2/3] can be used to describe the 
scattering and a linear fit of the plot of lnI( q) vs q2 gives I(0) 
from extrapolating to the y-intercept and Rg from the square 
root of the slope. Globular proteins should have a qRg less 
than 1.3 and more elongated shapes should have an even lower 
qRg [ 24], see Jacques and Trewhella [ 25] for the effects of 
interparticle interference and aggregation on SAXS data.
 3. Determine Rg and I(0) using GNOM [ 26]. I(0) and Rg 
should also be determined using the program GNOM from 
the pair distance distribution function P(r). Dmax should be 
chosen in GNOM with careful inspection of P(r), which pro -
vides real space information on the probable frequency of 
interatomic vector lengths ( r) within a macromolecule.
 4. Calculate molecular weight of the samples. Molecular weight 
should be calculated by multiple methods to demonstrate reli -
ability and to provide confidence in the scattering data. One 
such method depends on using the experimental data from a 
single scattering curve measured on a relative scale and within 
a defined high q (high angle) range, see Fischer et  al. [27]. 
Another method relies on the relative I(0) after scaling for 
concentration and using the BSA or lysozyme standards for 
calibration [ 28]. Here, the molecular weight of the experi -
mental protein sample (MWp) is calculated from the known 
molecular weight of the standard (MWst) using the following 
  formula: MWpIp
CpIs tCst=() *
()*0
0MWst
/, where I(0)p and I(0)st are 
  the scattering intensities at zero angle of the experimental pro -
tein and the standard, respectively, and Cp and Cst are the 
concentrations. Another way of calculating the molecular 
weight is based on a calibration of the scattering data with 
water to allow  normalizing the forward scattering to an abso -
lute scale. In that case the following formula may be used: 
MNI c
wA
M=()
()0
2/,
Dr where NA is the Avogadro constant 
6.02*1023, I(0) is the forward scattering of the protein at an 
absolute scale, c is the concentration of the molecule in solu -
tion, and ΔρM = ρM−ρS, the scattering length density differ -
ence; for a protein ΔρM on average equals 2.086*1010 cm−2 . 
Thus, from a water calibrated curve the molecular weight can 
be estimated by Mw= 1385* I(0)/ c, [29].
 5. Run 20 independent DAMMIF runs and align and average 
with DAMAVER to generate initial low-resolution ab initio  
Mirjam  Czjzek and  Elizabeth  Ficko-Blean
247
envelopes [ 30, 31]. The DAMAVER averaging provides NSD 
(normalized spatial discrepancy) values that tend toward zero 
if molecules closely resemble one another, or over one if they 
systematically differ.
 6. Model the 3D structures into the averaged DAMMIF molecular 
envelope ( see Notes 12  and 13). The pdb models of the modules 
should then be placed manually into the averaged DAMMIF 
molecular envelope using the program PyMOL [ 32]. SUBCOMB 
[33] can also be used to superimpose the 3D models into the 
averaged DAMMIF molecular envelope. If flexibility of the mol -
ecules is given, SASFIT is the most adapted software to use.
 7. Determine goodness of fit using CRYSOL from the ATSAS 
suite of programs. CRYSOL [ 34] should be used to predict 
the solution scattering for the pseudo–atomic resolution 
models and to calculate the quality of fit to the actual SAXS 
experimental curve, goodness of fit is represented by the χcrysol 
statistic, a lower χcrysol indicating a better fit.
 8. Determine the structure of the multimodular constructs using 
BUNCH [ 35] (see Notes 14–17 ). BUNCH uses a combined 
rigid body and ab initio  approach to modeling. The 3D struc -
tures of the modules are treated as rigid bodies and any missing 
amino acids are modeled in as dummy atoms. In BUNCH the 
models are generated by fitting to one or more of the scatter -
ing curves and the goodness of fit is represented by χBUNCH . 
The χcrysol should also be calculated for the BUNCH models 
using CRYSOL. The BUNCH generated models should be 
then superimposed into the averaged DAMAVER generated 
molecular envelope manually in PyMOL or using the program 
SUBCOMB.
 1. The orientation of the CBM32 relative to the catalytic module 
is known based on the X-ray crystal structure of GH84C_cat_
CBM32 (Fig. 2b-I). In PyMOL, overlay the CBM32-Cohesin 
component from the averaged DAMMIF manually fitted mod -
els (with the best χcrysol values) for both CBM32-Cohesin and 
the CBM32-Cohesin:FIVAR-Dockerin complex onto the 
GH84C_cat_CBM32 crystal structure into the averaged 
DAMMIF molecular envelope for GH84C_cat-CBM32-Cohe -
sin, this will generate two models for GH84C_cat-CBM32-  
Cohesin. A third model should be generated by manually fitting 
the X-ray crystal structure of GH84C_cat_CBM32 and the 
cohesin module into GH84C_cat-CBM32-Cohesin. Further 
models should be generated for GH84C_cat-CBM32-Cohesin 
using 10–20× BUNCH.  Evaluate the goodness of fit for all the 
models to the GH84C_cat-CBM32-Cohesin scattering curve 
using CRYSOL and determine the best model (usually that with 
the lowest χcrysol value).3.4 Piecing Together

 2. One important consideration when fitting the individual CBM32 
and cohesin modules into the SAXS envelopes containing 
the missing link from GH84C (CBM32-Cohesin) is that both 
the CBM and the cohesin module appear radially symmetric in 
the low-resolution envelopes, thus, while the relative angles 
between the long axes of the modules can be established, the 
rotational orientations of the modules relative to one another 
are impossible to determine. This has important implications 
in the final model as the orientation of the dockerin interaction 
site is not resolvable, though sterically the enzyme is most 
likely to have the dockerin interaction site facing away from the 
CBM or the catalytic module to accommodate the protein-
protein interaction with dockerin containing enzymes.
 3. To build the full-length model of GH84C, the cohesin module 
from the crystal structure of Cohesin-FN3 should be overlaid 
onto the cohesin module of the best GH84C_cat-CBM32-  
Cohesin model. This will generate a reasonable model for the 
GH84C full-length structure, GH84C_cat-CBM32-Cohesin-
 FN3 (Fig. 2d).
 4. Interpret the results. The pseudo-atomic resolution full-length 
structure of GH84C (Fig. 2d) should reveal that catalysis and 
carbohydrate binding, while distal (60  Å), are coordinated in the 
same line of direction in the enzyme. Thus, adherence and cataly -
sis may be optimized for terminal sugars, such as those found on 
the host cell or mucosal surface. The model should also place the 
Cohesin:Dockerin interaction site distal to the CBM32 ligand 
binding site, permitting concurrent adherence to carbohydrate 
ligand and enzyme recruitment. The positioning of the cohesin 
module relative to the CBM and catalytic module facilitates 
the placement of recruited enzymes in line themselves for 
attack on the carbohydrate surface. The recruitment of other 
ultra multimodular CAZymes, themselves having CBMs, raises 
the interesting possibility of avid binding to a  carbohydrate 
bearing surface mediated by complex protein-  carbohydrate 
interactions shared between two interacting CAZymes.
4 Notes
 1. Characterization of the modular structure requires careful bio -
informatic analysis of the boundaries between the individual 
modules. The potential signal peptides and transmembrane 
domains need to be predicted using SignalP and TMHMM, 
for example [ 36, 37]. The modularity of the mature enzyme or 
protein can then be examined using BLAST queries against 
UniProt database, as well as domain searches with the InterPro 
server [ 38, 39]. Coincidence of modular boundaries of at least 
three similar sequences gives a good estimate of where an indi -
Mirjam  Czjzek and  Elizabeth  Ficko-Blean
249
vidual module may start and end. A more precise delineation 
of each module can then be refined using Hydrophobic Cluster 
Analysis (HCA) [ 40]. It may also be useful to do a secondary 
structure prediction to avoid splitting within an alpha helix or 
beta strand that could destabilize the protein [ 41].
 2. When determining multimodular structures using the “dissect 
and build” method it is best to have as many different modular 
constructs as reasonably possible. Therefore, clone as many 
combinations of the modular constructs as is possible, as deter -
mined through careful bioinformatics analysis, into an appro -
priate expression vector, e.g., pET-28a(+) for production in E. 
coli. This redundancy will optimize the confidence in the con -
structed model and provide a backup in case of construct insta -
bility. The importance here is to have a surplus of soluble 
recombinant protein, so choose the expression strain and the 
expression vector carefully.
 3. Lyse the cells using an appropriate method such as the French 
pressure cell or chemical lysis. It is important to have a good 
lysis protocol for maximum yields.
 4. Accurate structural parameters of a macromolecule in solution 
are deduced from the scattering signal only if measured from a 
sample of monodisperse, identical particles. SAXS thus requires 
pure protein and any degradation products will influence the 
SAXS curves and the molecular envelopes generated will be 
biased by these impurities. Since the scattering signal increases 
proportional to the square of the molecular weight (MW), small 
amounts of contamination by large species (such as aggregates) 
will contribute disproportionately to the scattering signal and 
bias the data to larger structural parameters than those expected 
for the molecule of interest. At minimum, a two-step purification, 
such as purification on an IMAC (immobilized metal affinity 
chromatography) column through a 6his tag followed by a SEC 
(size exclusion chromatography) column to remove aggregates 
and other impurities, is recommended. Protein purity should not 
only be estimated by SDS-  PAGE, a Dynamic Light Scattering 
(DLS) analysis should be performed prior to sample collection to 
confirm the absence of aggregates.
 5. The scattering signal of a macromolecule in the solution is mea -
sured as the difference to the scattering from that of its sur -
rounding solvent. It is thus essential to match the buffers (e.g., 
50 mM Tris–HCl pH  7.5 and 100  mM NaCl) exactly for accu -
rate buffer subtraction; a single dialysis between 24 and 48  h is 
usually sufficient and the dialysate should be used for all dilu -
tions and measurements. Filter a stock of buffer immediately 
(approx. 50–100  ml) into a clean container for future use, dilu -
tions, etc. It is simplest if all the constructs are buffer exchanged 
into the same buffer, though this may not always be possible.

 6. If freezing samples for transport to the synchrotron, flash 
freezing in liquid nitrogen is recommended.
 7. Check with the beamline scientist, before preparing the sam -
ples, on how much sample volume is required per measure -
ment. Have more than enough protein prepared, just in case.
 8. Data should be collected on several (at least five) different con -
centrations of protein; typically a good data collection is 
obtained on samples that are between 1  mg ml−1 and 
10 mg ml−1 with volumes between 10 and 50  μL. SAXS data 
should also be collected on one or more characterized stan -
dards, such as BSA or hen egg white lysozyme. In between 
each protein sample collection a buffer sample should be col -
lected for buffer subtraction.
 9. Major problems in SAXS experiments are denaturation, degra -
dation, and aggregation of the protein sample. With problem 
proteins we have had some success with collecting SAXS data 
in several different buffers with the hopes of landing on the 
“right one” for protein stability. Another solution has been to 
take both fresh (4  °C) and frozen samples to the synchrotron 
and thawing the frozen sample just before collection. If aggre -
gation cannot be avoided it is probably best to collect data at a 
beamline that couples size exclusion chromatography with 
SAXS.  In all cases centrifuge all samples before use to minimize 
aggregate (e.g., 20,000  × g for 10  min).
 10. The development of small-angle scattering instrumentation is 
not devoid of technical challenges; however, schematically the 
experimental setup is relatively simple. A highly collimated 
X-ray beam, traditionally of a single wavelength, is used to 
illuminate the sample contained within a capillary (Fig. 1). The 
scattered radiation is recorded on a detector, while the direct 
beam is usually absorbed by a beam stop, the size and position 
of which are key factors for determining the minimum angle 
measured in an experiment. Online size exclusion chromatog -
raphy has become available at recent beamlines (e.g., ID-18 
BioSAXS/APS, SWING/SOLEIL, BL4–2/SSRL, BM-29/
ESRF, I22/Diamond, P12/Petra, SR13 ID01/Australian 
Synchrotron), where SAXS data is collected on the sample as it 
emerges from a size exclusion column, minimizing any aggre -
gative contributions to the SAXS curve.
 11. A detailed explanation on the physics behind SAXS and crystal -
lography has been elaborated extensively by Putnam et  al. [23] 
and the more practical aspects for good SAXS data collection 
and treatment by Jacques and Trewhella [ 25]. The ATSAS 
software suite provides a powerful group of programs [ 19, 20] 
for SAXS data treatment. It is important to note here that 
SAXS data analysis gives rise to measures of Rg, I(0) and Dmax 
Mirjam  Czjzek and  Elizabeth  Ficko-Blean
251
values, and all further modeling is associated with ambiguity. 
There can be several models that equally well describe a given 
scattering curve.
 12. Pdb files should be cleaned up by deleting any waters or ligands 
from the text file, any alternative conformations of amino acids 
should also be deleted. Oftentimes if one of the ATSAS model -
ing programs is unable to start or finish, it is due to a problem 
with mismatching amino acid sequences between the pdb 
file(s) and the input sequence.
 13. In many cases, it may be useful to construct a 3D model of a 
module if no pdb is publicly or privately available, in this case 
the Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 
(Phyre2) [ 42] is practical.
 14. Flexible systems. If flexibility in a system is suspected the SAXS 
data should be analyzed by the ensemble optimization method 
(EOM) [ 43], which also fits the modules as rigid bodies but 
outputs an ensemble of models to fit the SAXS scattering 
curve. Briefly, the program RanCH generates a pool of 10,000 
models and selection of the optimized ensemble is realized by 
GAJOE.  An overall χEOM is determined; however, we also find 
it informative to determine the individual χcrysol values for each 
of the models in the ensemble.
 15. Produce several models using different methodologies to 
ensure reproducibility which will provide confidence in the 
final model. For example, one model may be a crystal struc -
ture, another model may be generated by manually placing 
modules into the 20× DAMMIF DAMAVER averaged 
 molecular envelope and other models generated by 10–20× 
BUNCH.  EOM has on some occasions provided the best χcrysol 
value from one model in its ensemble, even relative to 
BUNCH.  Thus, it may be useful to generate “static” models 
using EOM even if flexibility is not suspected in the system.
 16. Good notetaking skills are essential. Note down what you do 
and how you obtained your models while it is still fresh. SAXS 
experiments involve a massive amount of data analysis and 
without good notetaking skills it is very easy to lose the thread.
 17. Finally, there is a very useful forum for any inevitable SAXS-  related 
questions you have found here: http://www.saxier.org/forum .

Abstract
Microorganisms play a primary role in regulating biogeochemical cycles and are a valuable source of 
enzymes that have biotechnological applications, such as carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). 
However, the inability to culture the majority of microorganisms that exist in natural ecosystems using 
common culture-dependent techniques restricts access to potentially novel cellulolytic bacteria and benefi -
cial enzymes. The development of molecular-based culture-independent methods such as metagenomics 
enables researchers to study microbial communities directly from environmental samples, and presents a 
platform from which enzymes of interest can be sourced. We outline key methodological stages that are 
required as well as describe specific protocols that are currently used for metagenomic projects dedicated 
to CAZyme discovery.

1 Introduction
The continuing initiative to find novel carbohydrate-active enzymes 
(CAZymes) is derived from societal and industrial interest in utiliz -
ing plant biomass as a substrate for biofuel production. Cellulose, 
the most abundant form of carbon on earth, is notoriously difficult 
to deconstruct using currently available enzyme technology, 
whereas a variety of ecosystems such as the digestive-tract of herbi -
vores [ 1] or termites’ [ 2] are able to efficiently utilize lignocellulosic 
biomass. This functional capacity is controlled by microorganisms 
that are largely irrecoverable in isolate form, which restricts direct 
access to their genetic and enzymatic machinery. Cultivability 
“bottlenecks” can be addressed by applying culture-independent 
methods such as metagenomics, whereby total DNA is directly 
extracted and analyzed from the microbial sample without any 
need for prior isolation. Numerous metagenomic studies have 
been used to find CAZymes [ 2–4] and can be designed using two 
differing approaches that are defined as either function- or 
256
sequence-based. Function-based approaches involve the ligation of 
environmental DNA fragments into vectors that are introduced 
into “pet” strains such as Escherichia coli . The DNA can then be 
expressed and the library screened for specific functions [ 5–7]; 
however, screening limitations have restricted the discovery of 
CAZymes that can deconstruct recalcitrant forms of cellulose. 
Sequence-based approaches can be divided into “targeted,” i.e., 
PCR amplification of particular genes of interest [ 8], or “shotgun” 
approaches that randomly sequence DNA extracted from an envi -
ronmental sample without any prior cloning or amplification step.
Shotgun metagenomics can theoretically generate sequences 
(reads) from all of the genomes present in the sample, collectively 
referred to as the metagenome. In particular, recent bioinformat -
ics progressions permit the complete reconstruction of a signifi -
cant fraction of constituent genomes within a sample. These 
methods have already shown potential to find new non-cultivable 
polysaccharide-  degrading bacteria [ 6, 9], and interpret synergistic 
relationships between uncultured phylotypes in a cellulolytic com -
munity [ 10]. Despite the inherent benefits, the use of shotgun 
metagenomics also comes with several defined challenges. The 
diversity of microbial species in digestive ecosystems combined 
with the immense data output of next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) platforms produces gigabytes of data that needs to be 
heavily annotated before it can be meaningfully interpreted. 
Today, a wide variety of different NGS platforms and bioinfor -
matic packages tailor-made for metagenome projects are available 
to scientists. However, careful considerations of available resources 
and technical challenges that are relevant for a particular sample 
are still required. It is the aim of this chapter to describe the appli -
cation of the biological and bioinformatic methods that are cur -
rently available in this rapidly developing field and to provide 
exemplar step-  by- step protocols to follow for samples originating 
from plant biomass degrading ecosystems (Fig. 1).

3 Methods
For metagenomic projects dedicated to CAZyme discovery, the 
goal is relatively straightforward: obtain large contiguous DNA 
fragments that are coupled with the fewest possible misassemblies 
so that many complete genes and operons are available for screen -
ing. Therefore, understanding which sequencing platform and the 
amount of sequencing required to achieve a superior quality data -
set are crucial when designing the project [ 11]. Different sequenc -
ing technologies have vastly different read lengths and base pair 
(bp) yield and require different amounts of sample DNA and 
downstream bioinformatic analyses (Table 1). The suitability of a 
specific type of NGS data to a given sample largely depends on the 
community structural complexity. Typically, shotgun sequencing 
results in deep coverage of dominant species and less reads from 
lower abundant species. To accommodate this discrepancy and 
gain greater access to the rarer community members, the sequenc -
ing effort must be increased; however, computational limitations 
need to be considered. Therefore, an initial evaluation of the com -
munity structure using 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis [ 12, 13] 
is recommended to help determine the complexity, as well as the 
choice of NGS platform and the depth of sequencing to obtain the 
dataset necessary for CAZyme gene searches.
The collection and processing of environmental samples is the first 
stage when planning a metagenomic project. Key considerations 
include the number of samples needed to adequately view the 2.2 Computational

temporal dynamics or variability within the ecosystem as well as 
fulfill operating requirements of downstream bioinformatic soft -
ware that require multiple samples ( see Subheading 3.5). Moreover, 
other “omic” techniques such as metaproteomics and metatran -
scriptomics can be used to efficiently complement the metage -
nomic analysis and its outcomes (Fig. 1 and Subheading 3.8). 
Extra subsamples can be easily stored in standardized ways to be 
analyzed later if required. In addition to the number of samples, 
the accompaniment of “metadata” can greatly enhance the ability 
to interpret the sequence data and particularly for comparative, 
spatial, or temporal series analysis. Metadata should appropriately 
describe the samples and the methods used. A suite of standard 
languages, called the Minimum Information about any (x) 
Sequence checklists (MIxS) [ 14], provides format for recording 
environmental and experimental data. These standards include 
MIGS (Minimum Information about a Genome Sequence) and 
MIMS (Minimum Information about a Metagenome Sequence) 
checklists [ 15, 16]. What is recorded depends on where the sam -
ples come from but usually includes, among others, temperature, 
pH, substrate, sample handling, DNA extraction method, sequenc -
ing technology, and the bioinformatic methods used.
When looking for CAZymes, samples vary greatly from different 
environments, such as guts, soils, excrements, sediments, bioreac -
tors, and other plant-associated biomass. These habitats present 3.3 Cell Dissociation

different characteristics such as the presence of host cells [ 2, 17], 
enzymatic inhibitors (such as humic acids) [ 18], or biofilms [ 19], 
and therefore require specific protocols. Samples of plant-biomass 
degrading communities often require an additional processing step 
to remove microbial cells that are attached to plant fibers [ 19]. 
In Subheading 3.3.1 , we describe a high-yield method that enables 
the dissociation of the microbial cells from the substrate and the 
recovery of the full sample’s diversity. The resulting cell biomass gen -
erated from this dissociation protocol is suitable for both kit-  based 
DNA extractions [ 20, 21] and Mamur’s derived protocols [ 19].
DNA extraction is an important part of the experimental design 
since it can have a major impact on the subsequent NGS platform 
and downstream bioinformatic analyses that are used. DNA extrac -
tion and purification is still considered a bottleneck for metagenomic 
analyses, compounded by the fact that there is not one common 
method that fits every environmental sample. Indeed, the quality and 
the quantity of DNA required vary from a sequencing technology to 
another and may influence the choice of the DNA extraction method 
(Table 1). For NGS platforms that require high concentrations of 
high molecular weight (HMW) DNA (e.g., PacBio), commercial kits 
may not provide adequate amounts of DNA.  In these instances, 
gentle noninvasive methods are required ( see Subheading 3.3.2 ), 
which produce far greater yields of HMW DNA without comprising 
the quality of community structural representation. In instances 
where a small cell biomass prohibits high nanograms or micrograms 
quantities of DNA, whole genome amplification of starting material 
can also be necessary. As with any amplification method, sequence 
biases can occur [ 22, 23] and their impacts depend on the amount of 
starting material and the required number of amplification rounds to 
produce sufficient amount of DNA.
The sample preparation is initially dependent on whether the sam -
ple has been stored as biomass sample at −80 °C or in 1/5 volume 
of phenol/ethanol (5%/95%) pH  8.0 at 4  °C (see Note 1 ).
 1. Transfer 1.0  g of biomass or 1.5  ml sample and phenol/ethanol 
mix with a wide bore pipette to a 2  ml tube.
 2. Centrifuge at 14,000 rcf at room temperature for 2  min.
 3. Discard supernatant and resuspend biomass in 500  μl of disso -
ciation buffer by vortexing for 30  s.
 4. Centrifuge at 100 rcf for 20  s at room temperature and transfer 
cell-containing supernatant to a new cell-collection tube and 
centrifuge at 14,000 rcf for 5  min at room temperature. 
Discard cell-free supernatant.
 5. Repeat dissociation buffer steps 3  and 4 two to three more 
times transferring each cell-containing supernatant in the same 
cell-collection tube ( see Note 2 ).3.3.1  Cell Dissociation

volume of CTAB Buffer.
 4. Heat 70  °C for 10  min.
 5. Add an equal volume of Chloroform. Mix well and centrifuge 
at 14,000 rcf for 15  min at room temperature. Transfer aque -
ous phase to new tube ( see Note 4 ).
 6. Add equal volume of Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamylalcohol 
(25:24:1). Mix well, centrifuge at 14,000 rcf for 15  min at 
room temperature, and transfer aqueous phase to new tube. 
!CAUTION Phenol, chloroform, and isoamylalcohol are 
harmful. Handle using appropriate safety equipment and 
measures.
 7. Add 2× vol of 95% ethanol and mix gently until DNA spools. 
Use a sterile loop to transfer the DNA to a tube containing 
200 μl 70% ethanol ( see Notes 5  and 6).
 8. Centrifuge at 14,000 rcf for 2  min at room temperature and 
carefully discard supernatant. Briefly air-dry the pellet.
 9. Resuspend in 20–30  μl TE buffer (pH  8.0) and stand at room 
temperature for 30–60  min to allow DNA to dissolve. Using a 
spectrophotometer, measure the OD 260 to estimate DNA con -
centration. DNA concentration should be adjusted to ~ 
0.5 μg/μl (see Notes 7  and 8).

Numerous next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are 
now available, providing cheaper, faster, and higher-throughput 
sequencing ( see reviews [ 24] and [ 25]). Methods that produce 
short reads, such as Illumina, can generate high sequencing depth 
at comparatively low costs (Table 1). Illumina’s HiSeq can gener -
ate over 1 terabyte of bases per run (2  × 150 bp, High Output Run 
Mode, Dual Flow Cell), whereas the MiSeq can produce up to 15 
Gbp (with 2  × 300 bp), with both platforms exhibiting mean error 
rates < 1% [ 26]. However, the high quantity of data for samples 
with high species complexity leads to increased difficulties for 
assembly, due to computational requirements. In theory, longer 
read sequencing technologies can overcome many of the known 
assembly problems associated with short reads because they have 
the potential to resolve complex repeats and span entire open read -
ing frames (ORFs). However, these technologies are traditionally 
accompanied with other inherent issues, such as lower sequencing 
depth and higher error rates. Examples of third generation sequenc -
ing technology include Oxford Nanopore’s MinION and single-  
molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) developed by Pacific 
Bioscience (PacBio). In particular, PacBio can provide reads of 
which 50% are over 20  kb and 5% exceeding 30  kb (PacBio RS II). 
High sequencing costs and error rates reported as high as 15% in 
individual reads have previously prevented the use of raw PacBio 
reads in metagenomics. However, it is possible to generate accu -
rate sequences by reading a circularized molecule multiple times (cir -
cular consensus or CCS) [ 27]. This approach reduces read length by 
a factor equal to the number of times the molecule is traversed but 
can ultimately result in high-quality sequences with greater than 99% 
accuracy and about 500–2500  nt in length (Table 1).
Assembly is a key stage required to generate large contiguous 
sequence fragments (contigs), which are required to maximize the 
number of open reading frames and operons available for down -
stream CAZyme screening. Assembly algorithms that process 
metagenomic data are highly sensitive to the read coverage for 
community members, which is correlated to the species complexity 
in a sample and the metagenomic sequencing depth. A plethora of 
assembly algorithms are currently available (reviewed by [ 24, 28]), 
including several that are designed to handle large metagenomic 
datasets such as IDBA_UD [ 29], MEGAHIT [ 30], and metaSPAdes 
[31]. Algorithms designed for longer reads typically use an overlap-  
consensus approach, where sufficiently similar reads (based on an 
overlapping nucleotide region) would be merged into a contig. 
Alternatively, many short-read assemblers use a de Bruijn graph 
approach and initially deconstruct each read into a series of oligo -
mers of a set “word” length (commonly referred to as “ k-mers”). 
The k-mer length is often a user-specified parameter, with longer 
k-mers overcoming repetitive/nonunique regions in the metage -
nome at a cost of reduced coverage and accuracy. In contrast, short 3.4 Sequencing 
and Assembly
Benoit J. Kunath et al.
263
k-mers generate contigs with higher coverage, but often shorter in 
length. Illumina data can provide high-quality metagenomic 
assemblies from complex microbial communities, which are con -
ducive to CAZyme searches. Specific examples include large datas -
ets that have been assembled from the rumen microbiome [ 3]. 
Subheading 3.4.1 , details the assembly of HiSeq data using 
IDBA_UD [ 29], an iterative (iterates from a small k to a large k) 
de Bruijn graph de novo assembler for short read sequencing data 
with highly uneven sequencing depth, which is typically character -
istic of many metagenomic datasets.
Alternative approaches to reduce the computational strain of 
metagenomic assembly include the use of taxonomic binning or 
normalization methods to select subsets of reads that are then 
assembled separately as well as hybrid assemblies that use data from 
multiple sequencing platforms [ 32, 33]. Hybrid assemblies are still 
infrequent, despite indications that combined approaches yield 
improvements in assembly contiguity and per-base accuracy, which 
are important in CAZyme discovery projects that seek to interro -
gate larger saccharolytic gene clusters ( see Subheading 3.7.2 ). In 
particular, previous studies have shown that high confidence reads 
from Illumina can be used to correct the errors inherent in PacBio 
sequences [ 34]. Combination of PacBio CCS and HiSeq reads pro -
vides improvement in assembly statistics such as total assembly size 
and large contig size [ 35]. It also improves the assembly of the 
universal marker genes, which assists taxonomic binning and enables 
enhancements in genome reconstruction of uncultured microor -
ganisms that inhabit complex communities [ 27]. Despite a paucity 
of algorithms customized for a hybrid input (to our knowledge), 
co-assembly can be attained using raw reads from PacBio CCS and 
Illumina datasets or by using a combination of several assemblers 
that are optimized for the different sequencing platforms [ 27]. 
Subheading 3.4.1  outlines the various stages required to assemble 
PacBio and Illumina raw reads using MIRA 4.0 [ 36].
When assembling metagenomic datasets from complex com -
munity, chimeric assemblies (misassemblies) can occur. 
Misassemblies can be prevented by producing paired-end reads, 
whereby one read of the pair may map to a common sequence or a 
repetitive element (ambiguous region with risk for chimeric assem -
bly), whereas the other can potentially map to a non-ambiguous 
region and prevent misassembly. Additionally, assembly with more 
stringent parameters, such as higher identity threshold or longer 
minimum overlap (Subheading 3.4.1 ), can also help avoid chime -
ric assemblies. Even after applying these precautions, contigs 
should always be inspected. Abrupt change in GC% content and 
read coverage within a same contig can indicate chimeric assembly. 
Changes in the contigs’ characteristics can be visualized using dif -
ferent tools such as Anvi’o [ 37] or MGAviewer [ 38].

Binning is the post-assembly taxonomic assignment of contigs into 
genome bins that enables the study of individual organisms (and 
their interactions), directly from deeply sequenced metagenomes. 
Therefore, the task of a binning tool is to assign an identifier to 
every assembled contig, with each identifier ideally representing 
a single genome [ 39]. Taxonomic binning tools, such as Megan 
[40], PhyloPythiaS+ [ 41], and taxator-tk [ 42], act as classifiers Co-assembly of  PacBio

266
and label contigs with taxa from an existing taxonomy, such as the 
NCBI Taxonomy database [ 43] (Subheading 3.5.1  “Taxonomic 
Binning with Taxator-tk”). Unsupervised and reference-free bin -
ning tools traditionally use oligonucleotide composition to group 
contigs with similar usage, thus effectively differentiating between 
contigs of different species, in particular focusing on their tetranu -
cleotide frequencies [ 44]. Today, binning tools increasingly lever -
age additional information to improve genome recovery even in the 
presence of multiple genomes from individual species in a sample, 
such as paired-end read linkage [ 45], mean contig coverage [ 46], 
per- sample (differential) coverage [ 47], or combinations thereof 
[48, 49]. High-quality genomes can be recovered (Subheading 
3.5.1  “Unsupervised Binning with MetaBAT”), in particular if 
multiple metagenomes of the same community were generated, 
which subsequently can be mined for new CAZymes. In addition, 
binning results should be inspected carefully by, e.g., looking at 
taxonomic assignments of individual contigs, visualizing the under -
lying differential coverage information (as done in Albertsen et  al. 
[50]), or using an automated method for assessing the quality of 
metagenome-  derived microbial genomes [ 51] (Subheading 3.5.1  
“Quality Assessment for Near-Complete Genomes with CheckM”). 
Overall, computational tool development for taxonomic binning is a 
very active research area. The “Critical Assessment of Metagenomic 
Information” (CAMI) initiative [ 52] continuously benchmarks 
tools for binning, metagenome assembly, and profiling on various 
benchmark datasets reflecting common experimental setups and 
properties of underlying microbial communities. Up-to-date evalu -
ation results for several use cases and commonly utilized software 
are available at: https://data.cami-challenge.org /
Input:
Metagenome assembly ( see Subheading 3.4)
Taxator-tk refpack
Usage:

Taxator-tk is a very precise tool across all ranks and taxa. Therefore, 
it is exceptionally useful to complement and verify unsupervised 
binning approaches, as outlined below.

Usually, there is a tradeoff between a tool’s sensitivity and specificity. 
MetaBAT’s default settings work reasonably well for most use 
cases. However, for very simple or very complex communities, 
nondefault options might improve binning results. Please run:  
metabat -h
Input:
Genome bins in Fasta format
Usage:
checkm	lineage_wf 	-x	fa	<bin	folder>	<output

Output:
Contamination and completeness estimates for each genome bin
“Contamination” and “completeness” are estimated using a set of 
clade-specific marker genes that should occur only once per 
genome. Sometimes, contigs from multiple strains of the same 
organism can be found in the same genome bin and potentially 
contribute toward “contamination.” Therefore, CheckM also lists 
the percentage of contamination that can be explained by “strain 
heterogeneity .”
Once a metagenomic dataset has been adequately assembled and 
taxonomically assigned, gene calling or ORF prediction is required 
to identify protein or RNA coding regions within the (meta)
genome. Depending on the assembly, its feasibility, and its suc -
cess, gene calling can be performed on assembled contigs or raw 
reads (for long read NGS data). There are two different ways for 
ORF prediction: the “sequence similarity-based” method and the 
“ab initio” gene calling method [ 53]. The “sequence similarity-
based” method uses homology searches to identify genes similar 
to those already present in databases. This method possesses high 
specificity and ability to characterize functions of predicted genes. 
The “ab initio” gene calling approach relies on dependencies 
between codon frequencies and genome nucleotide composition 
to discriminate coding from noncoding regions. Frequently, 
metagenomic assemblies result in many genes that are partially 
sequenced or fragmented. In addition, metagenomic data from 
diverse communities can have too low similarities with sequences 
from databases due to evolutionary distance or short contig/read 
lengths, which can prevent the identification of homologs and 
poor detection of novel genes. Therefore, ab initio tools such as Quality Assessment 
for Near-Complete 
Genomes with  CheckM
3.6 Gene Calling
Metagenomics and  CAZyme Discovery
268
MetaGeneMark [ 54] are essential for metagenomic analysis, espe -
cially when looking for novel enzymes [ 53]. Utilization of 
MetaGeneMark has been successfully used to predict ORFs from 
various metagenomes [ 55–57], and requires minimal effort to 
operate.
MetaGeneMark (v3.26) can be used via a web service (http://exon.
gatech.edu/meta_gmhmmp.cgi ) or downloaded on the GeneMark 
website and run with the following command line:
gmhmmp –m MetaGeneMark_v1.mod -f G –a –d
where –f provides a gff output file and –a and –d incorporate 
the protein and the nucleotide sequences of the predicted genes in 
the output.
More detail can be found on the MetaGeneMark manual 
(https://github.com/ablab/quast/blob/master/libs/genemark/
macosx/README.MetaGeneMark ).
Gene calling is typically followed by functional annotation, which 
details comparisons of predicted ORFs to previously annotated 
sequences present in functional databases. The objective is to gener -
ate accurate annotations to correctly identify orthologues. There are 
multiple approaches to annotate ORFs and numerous tools and data -
bases are publicly available. These include, among others, COG 
(Clusters of Orthologous Groups) for functional grouping [ 58], 
Pfam (the protein families database) for the identification of protein 
families and domains [ 59], TIGRfam for full-length protein families 
[60], and Enzyme Commission (E.C.) numbers for numerical clas -
sification scheme for enzymes, based on the chemical reactions they 
catalyze [ 61]. In addition, particular databases enable reconstruction 
of pathway maps for cellular and organismal functions. Key examples 
include KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes) [ 62] 
and MetaCyc (metabolic Pathway Database) [ 63].
Many functional annotation resources are collectively available 
via web-based platforms that provide support for visualization and 
comparative analysis of metagenomic datasets. For example, the 
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-Joint Genome Institute hosts 
the Integrated Microbial Genomes with Microbiome Samples—
Expert Review (IMG/MER) system, which provides support for 
functional annotation and curation of metagenomic datasets of 
interest. A typical pipeline analysis in IMG/MER starts with the 
user uploading metagenomic contigs and/or unassembled reads. 
Protein-coding genes are identified using four ab initio gene-  
calling tools: GeneMark, Metagene, Prodigal, and FragGeneScan. 
Finally, predicted proteins are compared with protein families and 
proteomes of selected “core” genomes. Protein sequences are 
compared with COG using RPS-BLAST [ 64] and Pfam and 
TIGRfam using HMMER 3 [ 65]. Finally, protein-coding genes 
are associated with KEGG Orthology terms, EC numbers, and 3.6.1  Gene Prediction

phylogeny using USEARCH [ 66] against a nonredundant refer -
ence database composed of the public genomes available on IMG 
and KEGG databases. Further information and a procedure to 
submit data on IMG can be found on [ 67] and on IMG website 
(https://img.jgi.doe.gov /).
For metagenomic projects dedicated to CAZyme discovery it is 
recommended that ORFs are annotated using a specialized data -
base. The most comprehensive database is the CAZy database [ 68] 
(hereafter called CAZyDB), which specializes in the display and 
analysis of genomic, structural, and biochemical information on 
carbohydrate-active enzymes. The CAZyDB contains more than 
300 families of catalytic and ancillary modules and is presented as 
glycoside hydrolases (GHs), glycosyltranferases (GTs), polysaccha -
ride lyases (PLs), carbohydrate esterases (CEs), auxiliary activities 
(AAs), and the carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). The 
CAZyDB identifies evolutionary-related families using the classifi -
cation introduced by Bernard Henrissat [ 69], which are based on 
significant amino acid sequence similarity with at least one bio -
chemically characterized founding member. The CAZy group 
actively develops tools for unambiguous high-throughput modular 
and functional annotation of CAZymes in sequences issued from 
genomic and metagenomic efforts. Annotation of unpublished 
datasets therefore requires collaboration with CAZy researchers; 
otherwise, query proteins are required to be deposited as finished 
entries in GenBank (or EMBL and DDBJ) and will be analyzed via 
their operational routines.
Several alternatives to CAZyDB currently exist for automated 
CAZyme annotation, including dbCAN [ 70] and CAT [ 71]; how -
ever, neither has the same levels of manual inspection by expert 
curators that is offered by CAZy. Importantly, dbCAN enables 
automated and comprehensive annotation that is based on the 
classification scheme of CAZy but relies on a defined signature 
domain model for each CAZy family [ 70]. In addition, signature 
domains of each CAZy family are represented by a hidden Markov 
model that is available to the public and easily amendable to local 
searches within unpublished metagenomic datasets. Searches 
against the dbCAN database can be performed either through its 
web platform or locally and are described below.

In addition to identifying individual CAZymes, it is valuable to 
observe a more global picture by identifying the gene localization 
and organization of CAZymes encoded in the microbial commu -
nity. This enables visualization of potential plant biomass degrad -
ing operons that are encoded within a metagenome. Several 
saccharolytic mechanisms such as polysaccharide utilization loci 
(PULs) and cellulosomes are encoded in large gene clusters and 
have been successfully recovered in metagenomes [ 10, 72]. Tools 
such as the IMG/MER are conducive to identifying gene clusters, 
whereby once a metagenome has been uploaded, signature protein 
domains for specific gene clusters can be searched and the sur -
rounding ORFs visualized and functionally interrogated. For 
PULs, several pfam domains represent the archetypical outer-  
membrane proteins SusC and SusD [ 73], including the IDs; 
TonB_dep_Rec (PF00593), TonB_C (PF03544) SusD (PF07980), 
SusD-like (PF12741), SusD-like_2 (PF12771), and SusD-like_3 
(PF14322). For cellulosomes, key signatures include cohesin 
(PF00963) and dockerin (PF00404) domains. In addition to 
known operons, other uncharacterized operons can be investigated 
by using gene identifiers from previously identified CAZymes as a 
search query and by interrogating surrounding genomic regions. 
However, such an approach requires manual intervention and is 
not amendable to large collections of CAZymes. Alternative 
approaches that use bioinformatics methods to identify uncharac -
terized operons are discussed below (Subheading 3.8).
Many CAZymes are multimodular with catalytic modules and one 
or more additional domains that are often substrate-targeting 
carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). “Module walking” is a 
method that probes the potential CAZyme activity of unknown 
regions or domains of ORFs that flank annotated CAZyme 
domains. This method has been used by [ 74] to find a new LPMO 
family (AA11). Based on the observation that several sequences 
from AA9 LPMO family carry a conserved domain of unknown 
function (X278), Hemsworth et  al. searched for other multimodu -
lar proteins containing that domain. Subsequently, they looked at 
the adjacent regions within an X278-encoding ORF and identified 3.7.2  Identifying Plant 
Biomass Degrading 
Operons
3.8 Identifying New 
Gene Targets

271
hypothetical domains with LPMO-like characteristics. Interestingly, 
those domains did not exhibit significant similarity to other LPMOs 
families (AA9 and AA10) and were thus considered a new LPMO 
family (AA11).
Methods that investigate bacterial genotype-phenotype infer -
ences attempt to link genetic features across bacterial genomes 
from strains with a common phenotype (e.g., plant biomass degra -
dation) and have the potential to identify novel domains and 
CAZyme families [ 75, 76]. In particular, machine learning meth -
ods can learn phenotype models by exploiting co-occurrence pat -
terns of phenotype and protein families in genomes or across the 
course of evolution (shared gain and loss events) to determine sets 
of protein families that are predictive of a phenotype [ 77, 78]. 
These phenotype models can also be used to identify phylotypes 
that encode the phenotype of interest from metagenomic draft 
genomes. We previously developed a method that used support 
vector machines (SVMs) [ 79] to determine the protein families 
distinctive for plant biomass degradation from the genomes of a 
large curated set of plant biomass degrading bacteria and non-  
degraders [ 80]. We identified Pfam and CAZy families known to 
be implicated with plant biomass degradation but also uncharac -
terized protein families that represent potential new CAZymes. 
The model was also applied to draft genomes of uncultured phylo -
types from a cow rumen metagenome [ 3] and identified 
Bacteroidetes-affiliated phylotypes predicted to be involved in 
plant biomass degradation, which was supported by biochemical 
analysis of enzymatically active CAZymes [ 9]. In a complementary 
approach, we identified functional modules that are distinctive for 
plant biomass degradation [ 81]. Each of the five plant biomass 
degradation modules incorporated protein families involved in 
degradation of different components of plant material such as cel -
lulose, hemicellulose, and pectin but also the structural compo -
nents of the cellulosome. Using these modules, we identified many 
characterized plant biomass degradation-associated operons in 
genomes of known lignocellulose degraders. Importantly, we also 
revealed many uncharacterized gene clusters that contain both 
known CAZy families and hypothetical proteins, which have 
become targets for on-going biochemical characterization studies 
in our lab.
Traitar is a newly developed software for the accurate predic -
tion of 67 diverse microbial phenotypes, among them 24 traits 
dedicated to degradation of various mono- and oligosaccharides, 
from isolate genomes and genomes from metagenomes or single 
cells [ 82]. Genome characterization by Traitar accurately comple -
mented a manual metabolic reconstruction of two uncultured phy -
lotypes that were recovered from a digestive ecosystem. The 
software can be used as a first pass method to characterize novel

phylotypes. For instance, it is particularly suitable for finding 
saccharolytic genomes and identifying the protein families within 
these genomes that play a role in carbohydrate degradation ( see 
Subheading 3.7).
Other methodologies to consider that can assist in CAZyme 
identification is the incorporation of additional “meta-omic” data 
such as metaproteomics or metatranscriptomics, which are powerful 
tools when used in combination with metagenomics. In  particular, 
mapping meta-omic data against reconstructed genomes enables 
the visualization of the species identity, together with the relative 
quantity of key carbohydrate-active enzymes and proteins that are 
expressed. Such techniques have the potential to detect known 
CAZymes that are metabolically active, as well as to identify hypo -
thetical genes that are upregulated and/or expressed in response 
to growth on a particular plant biomass substrate. In such instances, 
these emphasized ORFs are presented as key targets for down -
stream biochemical characterization.

4 Notes
 1. Biomass samples can be stored at 4  °C in phenol/ethanol 
(5%/95%) pH  8.0 for several weeks or as a biomass sample at 
−80 °C for longer periods. We recommend processing the 
 samples as quickly as possible. Longer storage may result in 
differential lysis of microbial cells.
 2. After two to three repetitions the cell-containing supernatant 
in step 4  should become much clearer as cells are removed and 
collected. Long exposure of samples to dissociation buffer 
should be avoided due to its low pH.  It is recommended that 
not more than two to three repetitions be performed.
 3. Dissociated cells may be stored at 4  °C for 1  day or at −20 °C 
for several weeks.
 4. CTAB specifically binds to proteins at high salt concentrations. 
Steps 3–5  should remove cell wall debris, denatured proteins, 
and polysaccharides complexed to CTAB, while retaining the 
nucleic acids in solution. Aqueous phase should be clear before 
proceeding to step 6 . If aqueous phase still retains an opaque-  
yellow color, repeat steps 3–5.
 5. Caution! Ethanol is flammable. Handle using appropriate 
safety equipment and measures.
 6. If no DNA spools in step 7  it implies either the DNA is of low 
concentration and/or DNA has sheared into relatively low-  
molecular weight fragments. In this instance, DNA can still be 
collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rcf for 30  min at 4  °C 
before proceeding to step 8 .
 7. DNA can take up to an hour at room temperature to resus -
pend since DNA is HMW.  Take care not to over dry pellet as 
this will make resuspending much more difficult.
 8. DNA can be stored at 4  °C for several weeks or at −20 °C for 
longer terms. It is recommended to restrict the number of freeze 
thaw cycles as this can degrade HWM DNA.
Due to the inherent species complexity found in many microbial 
communities, many bottlenecks still confront metagenomic proj -
ects. A consideration when facing complex communities is to 
decrease species complexity while keeping its potential for new dis -
covery. This can be achieved by enriching for a consortium that 
maintains a desired function, such as plant biomass deconstruction. 
Such an approach can allow the cultivation of microbes that cannot 
be isolated in pure cultures but provides information on microbial 
interactions in the biological system under chosen conditions. 
There are several ways to enrich a community for a specific func -
tional trait. Physico-chemical parameters such as temperature, acid -
ity, or substrate can be fine-tuned to enrich specific types of 4.1 Current

274
microorganisms, whereas serial dilutions (dilution-to-extinction 
approach) can be used to decrease the diversity. The serial dilution 
method has been applied on  communities from soil [ 10] and the 
rumen [ 83], where samples have been enriched on filter paper or 
avicel to obtain a cellulolytic consortium. In [ 10], the authors man -
aged to reconstruct the genomes of seven uncultured phylotypes 
that suggested cooperation for cellulose degradation in soil, an envi -
ronment with high species complexity that is notoriously difficult to 
study with metagenomics.
Every metagenome is unique and requires specific consideration 
and analyses to adapt to its particular confines. Using today’s molec -
ular tool-kit together with the constant improvements in sequencing 
technologies and bioinformatics tools, the mining for CAZymes 
and novel enzymes is becoming more accessible and amendable. 
Data can be generated from a wider range of environments, providing 
a direct way to interrogate uncultivable phylotypes that constitute a 
microbial community and enable access to untapped sources of new 
and interesting CAZymes.

Identification of  Genes Involved in  the Degradation 
of Lignocellulose Using Comparative Transcriptomics
Robert  J. Gruninger, Ian  Reid, Robert  J. Forster, Adrian  Tsang, 
and Tim A. McAllister
Abstract
Lignocellulosic biomass represents an abundant, renewable resource that can be used to produce biofuels, 
low-cost livestock feed, and high-value chemicals. The potential of this resource has led to intensive research 
efforts to develop cost effective methods to breakdown lignocellulose. The efficiency with which the anaerobic 
fungi (phylum Neocallimastigomycota) degrade plant biomass is well recognized and in recent years has 
received renewed interest. Transcriptomics has been used to identify enzymes that are expressed by these fungi 
and are involved in the degradation of a range of lignocellulose feedstocks. The transcriptome is the entire 
complement of coding and noncoding RNA transcripts that are expressed by a cell under a particular set of 
conditions. Monitoring changes in gene expression can provide fundamental information about the biology 
of an organism. Here we outline a general methodology that will enable researchers to conduct comparative 
transcriptomic studies with the goal of identifying enzymes involved in the degradation of the plant cell wall. 
The method described here includes growth of fungal cultures, isolation and sequencing of RNA, and a basic 
description of data analysis for bioinformatic identification of differentially expressed transcripts.

1 Introduction
High-throughput genome sequencing provides detailed information 
about the complete composition of genes and genetic regulatory 
elements that are present in an organism or an environment. A 
limitation of these studies is that they do not provide information 
on what genes are being actively expressed under a particular set of 
conditions. Sequencing the transcriptome fills this knowledge gap 
and reveals all of the genes that are being expressed under a par -
ticular set of conditions. Importantly, altering growth conditions and 
monitoring the corresponding changes in gene expression enables 
researchers to understand how an organism or microbial popula -
tion responds to environmental changes. Comparative transcrip -
tomics has been a powerful tool for uncovering the mechanisms 
280
that are employed by lignocellulose degrading microbes to break 
down the plant cell wall, and has been used to identify essential 
carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) involved in this process 
[1, 2].
Anaerobic fungi within the phylum Neocallimastigomycota 
are known to be efficient degraders of lignocellulose and express a 
large contingent of CAZymes [ 3–5]. Many of these enzymes show 
low levels of sequence identity to proteins that have been charac -
terized to date [ 4, 5]. Unlike with aerobic fungi, the oxidative 
enzymes involved in breaking down lignin and exposing cellulose 
and hemicellulose do not function in anaerobic environments [ 6]. 
The CAZyme cocktails that are produced by Neocallimastigomycota 
have been found to show similar levels of efficiency as the currently 
produced commercial enzyme preparations from Trichoderma  and 
Aspergillus  [5]. Due to the fastidious nature of the anaerobic gut 
fungi, commercial scale production of these enzymes has not yet 
become feasible. Transcriptomic studies of Neocallimastigomycota 
have led to the identification and characterization of a range of 
CAZymes that may allow for production of these enzymes using a 
system more amenable to industrial scale fermentation [ 4, 5].
In this chapter we outline a general methodology that will 
enable researchers to conduct comparative transcriptomic studies 
with the goal of identifying enzymes that are involved in the deg -
radation of the plant cell wall. The method described here will 
include the growth of fungal cultures, isolation and sequencing of 
RNA, and a basic description of data analysis for bioinformatic 
identification of differentially expressed transcripts. Although this 
method will focus on anaerobic fungal cultures, this approach can 
also be employed to study other eukaryotes.

 4. Using a Hungate system on the benchtop ( see Note 1 ), gently 
bubble reduced, anaerobic CO 2 into the media and bring 
media to a boil being careful that the media does not boil over. 
Add 0.1  g of cysteine to boiling media to fully reduce it.
 5. Boil the media until it changes colour from pink to a pale 
yellow/clear.
 6. Dispense 100  mL of reduced media ( see Note 2 ) into culture 
bottle containing the appropriate amount of carbon source to 
make the final concentration 1% (w/v for solid substrates or 
v/v for liquid substrates).
 7. Cap bottles containing reduced media and carbon source and 
autoclave ( see Note 3 ).
Grow anaerobic fungi using aseptic technique under strict anaerobic 
conditions. When conducting comparative transcriptomic experi -
ments it is important to have at least two biological replicates so 
that statistical analysis can be carried out. If possible, three biologi -
cal replicates are advised. This experimental design can be used for 
comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of anaerobic fungi 
grown with three different carbon sources: (1) glucose, (2) barley 
straw, (3) alfalfa hay ( see Note 4 ). To determine basal gene expres -
sion, grow three cultures using glucose as the sole carbon source.
 1. When media has cooled, inoculate cultures with fungal mycelia 
and incubate at 39  °C under anaerobic conditions for 72  h. Do 
not shake flasks ( see Note 5 ).
 2. Using a vacuum filter fitted with a Büchner funnel and 
Whatmann paper to carefully separate the liquid culture from 
the fungal mycelia and any insoluble material ( see Note 6 ).
 3. Carefully separate the fungal mycelia and associated growth 
substrate from culture supernatant and freeze in liquid nitrogen 
(see Note 7 ).
The fungal mycelia penetrate insoluble cellulosic substrates such as 
straw or filter paper during fungal growth. This prevents separation 
of the mycelia from the growth substrate and necessitates the 
grinding of the entire mass.
 1. Grind frozen mycelia to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle 
under liquid nitrogen. Ensure that mycelia remain frozen through -
out the grinding procedure to prevent degradation of RNA.
 2. Add TRIzol to ground mycelia using approximately 1  mL of 
TRIzol per 100  mg of ground mycelia. An insufficient volume 
of TRIzol will result in DNA contamination of isolated RNA.
 3. Completely suspend ground mycelia in TRIzol. The TRIzol/
fungal suspension can be stored in 1.0–1.5  mL aliquots and 
stored at −80 °C for later use, or RNA can be isolated from 
samples right away ( see Note 8 ).3.2 Growth of  Fungal

The following two-step procedure for isolation and purification of 
total RNA routinely generates RNA suitable for RNA-seq 
analysis.
 1. Purify total RNA from TRIzol/fungal suspensions according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions ( see Note 9 ).
 2. Resuspend RNA pellet in 100  μL of RNase-free water and pro -
ceed to column purification of total RNA using MEGAclear kit 
(see Note 10 ).
 1. Add 350  μL of binding buffer (provided in kit) to 100  μL 
RNA from previous step and purify RNA according to manu -
facturer’s instructions.
 2. Elute RNA with 50  μL of elution buffer. Be sure to repeat the 
elution a second time so that a total of 100  μL of column cleaned 
RNA has been collected in the same collection tube. The final 
volume of purified RNA will be 100  μL (see Note 11 ).
 3. Quality check and determination RNA concentration using 
an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and 6000 RNA nano 
kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(see Note 12 ).
There are a large number of commercial and homemade methods 
available for users wishing to generate a library for RNA-seq exper -
iments. Our lab uses the protocol for strand-specific library prepa-
ration optimized by Illumina, and the kits that are associated with 
this method. Due to our familiarity with this method, the protocol 
presented here will specifically refer to library preparation using the 
TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample preparation kit (Illumina). For 
additional information regarding this protocol users are  encouraged 
to consult the Illumina documentation. Reagents that are not 
included will be identified. A flowchart showing the steps involved 
in library generation is shown in Fig. 1. Prior to starting any of the 
following steps, remove the appropriate buffers or reagents from 
the freezer/fridge and allow them to reach room temperature.
The first component of generating a library for RNA sequencing of 
fungal mRNA is the isolation of poly-adenylated transcripts from 
total RNA, and the cleavage of these mRNA transcripts into frag -
ments suitable for sequencing, typically 100–200  bp. Depending 
on the number of samples being processed you can use individual 
0.3 mL PCR tubes, 0.3  mL 8-tube PCR strips or 0.3  mL 96-well 
PCR plates for setting up these reactions. Ensure that the sample 
tubes are compatible with your magnetic block.
 1. Dilute RNA sample so that there is a total of 0.1–4  μg of total 
RNA in a final volume of 50  μL using RNAse free distilled 
water ( see Note 13 ).3.4 Isolation

 2. Vortex RNA purification Oligo-dT beads (included in kit) to 
fully resuspend them and add 50  μL of beads to the diluted RNA 
sample. Gently pipette the whole solution up and down to com -
pletely mix beads and RNA, and then seal the tube(s)/plate.
 3. Place sealed sample in a thermal cycler set to 65  °C and incu -
bate for 5  min to denature RNA and facilitate binding to beads
 4. Remove sample from thermal cycler and place in magnetic 
stand. Allow sample to sit in the stand at room temperature for 
5 min to fully capture the magnetic Oligo-dT beads that are 
now bound to poly-adenylated mRNA. ( see Note 14 ).
 5. After 5  min, while the sample tube(s) is still in the magnetic 
block, carefully remove the supernatant.
 6. Remove sample tube(s) from the magnetic block and resuspend 
beads in 200  μL of Bead Washing Solution (included in kit). 
Gently but thoroughly mix the beads and washing solution.
 7. Place tube(s) into magnetic block and incubate at room 
temperature for 5  min to pellet beads. Carefully remove the 
supernatant leaving a bead pellet in the tube(s). The supernatant

 6. Seal tubes and fragment RNA by incubating in a thermal cycler 
at 94  °C for 8  minutes. Cool samples to 4  °C and remove from 
thermal cycler.
 7. Proceed to synthesis of first strand cDNA.  The Elute, Prime, 
Fragment mix contains random hexamer primers that will be 
used by reverse transcriptase in first strand synthesis to synthe -
size cDNA.
 1. Place tube containing purified, fragmented RNA into mag -
netic block to capture beads. Remove 17  μL of supernatant 
containing the fragmented RNA and transfer it into a clean

The next steps require fresh 80% DNAse/RNAse free ethanol and 
AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). To make the ethanol solu -
tion mix 84  mL 95% ethanol with 16  mL of nuclease free water. 
AMPure XP beads must be thoroughly resuspend with a vortex 
and equilibrated to room temperature prior to use.
 1. Add 20  μL of Second Strand Marking Master Mix (included in 
kit) and 5  μL of Resuspenion Buffer (included in kit) to each 
sample tube/well (these are the same tubes that were used in 
the first strand synthesis reaction). Mix thoroughly with a 
pipette and seal tube(s)/plate.
 2. Place sealed tube(s)/plate in a thermal cycler set to 16  °C and 
incubate for 1  h. to synthesize second strand DNA.
 3. Add 90  μL of AMPure XP beads to each sample tube/well and 
mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 10×.
 4. Incubate AMPure XP beads with samples for 15  min at room 
temperature and then capture beads using magnetic block for 
a minimum of 5  min.
 5. Without disturbing pelleted AMPure XP beads, remove 135  μL 
of supernatant from each sample tube/well.
 6. With samples still in magnetic block, add 200  μL of freshly pre -
pared 80% ethanol to each tube/well without disturbing beads.
 7. With sample tube(s)/plate still on the magnetic block, incu -
bate beads in 80% ethanol for 30  s and then carefully remove 
supernatant without disturbing beads.

The following sections will provide users with the programs 
required to process and analyze the sequence data obtained from 
the sequence provider. Ensure that the software listed in Table 1 is 
installed and that the executables are on the system search 
PATH.  We provide examples of the commands that are input using 
a command line interface to run each step. These commands may 
need to be modified to work with your system and the file names 
you have selected. Commands are preceded by the > symbol indi -
cating separate command lines. This section assumes that users are 
familiar with unix-based operating systems and are comfortable 
working from the command line.
 1. Create a working directory and copy the RNA-Seq read 
FASTQ files there. We will assume that the reads are paired-

 11. Make a directory for evaluating transcriptome quality and copy 
the files in transcripts.fasta, R1.fastq.gz and R2.fastq.gz into it. 
Use cleaned reads if available.
 12. Evaluate transcriptome accuracy using TransRate [ 12] (see

Once sequencing data has gone through quality control checks 
and been assembled into contigs, a statistical analysis program can 
be used to identify genes that are either up or down regulated in 
response to changes in carbon source. There are several available 
programs but we will limit our description to the Bioconductor 
package DESeq2 [ 14].
 1. Make a working directory and copy reads and transcript files 
there.
  > mkdir expression
  > cd expression
  > cp R*.fastq.gz
  > cp transcripts.fasta
 2. Using a text editor, prepare a metadata.tsv file with a tab-  
delimited line for each RNA sample specifying the filename 
and experimental variables such as carbon source (Csource). 
An example is shown below.
     Csource
     R_G1    Glucose
     R_G2    Glucose
     R_G3    Glucose
     R_A1    Alfalfa
     R_A2    Alfalfa
     R_A3    Alfalfa
     R_B1    Barley Straw
     R_B2    Barley Straw

of Differentially 
Expressed Transcripts.

 3. Index the transcripts.
  > salmon index -t transcripts.fasta -i 
transcripts_index --type quasi -k 31
 4. Count both the paired-end and single-end reads mapping to 
each transcript in each sample.
(a) Paired-end reads in files named Sample_R1.fastq.gz and 
Sample_R2.fastq.gz:
  > for f in *_R1.fastq.gz ; do salmon quant 
-i transcripts_index -l ISR −1 $f −2 ${f%1.
fastq.gz}2.fastq.gz -o {f%_R1.fastq.gz}_
quant -p 12 --useVBOpt; done
(b) Single-end reads in files named Sample.fastq.gz:
   > for f in *.fastq.gz ; do salmon quant -i 
transcripts_index -l SR -r $f -o {f%.fastq.
gz}_quant -p 12 --useVBOpt; dNext
 5. Collect the read counts into a tab-delimited text file that can 
be used as input for DESeq2  in R.  A Python script to collect 
the counts is available on request from the authors.
 6. Start R.
 7. Make DESeq2 available.
  > library(“DESeq2”)
 8. Load counts and metadata tables.
  > counts <− read.delim(“counts.tsv”,header=T)
  > metadata <− read.delim(“metadata.
tsv”,header=T)
 9. Calculate DESeq2 statistics assuming carbon source (Csource 
in the metadata.tsv file created in step 14 ) is the only experi -
mental variable and Glucose is the control level of Csource.
  > dds <− DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = 
counts[,-1], colData = metadata, design = ~ 
Csource ).
  > dds$Csource <− relevel(dds$Csource, 
“Glucose”).
  > dds <− DESeq(dds)
 10. Extract results for transcripts that are differentially expressed 
with Alfalfa as Csource. This step should be repeated using 
Barley straw as Csource to identify transcripts differentially 
expressed with this substrate.
  > DE.Alfalfa <− results(dds, contrast=c(“C
source”,"Alfalfa”,"Glucose”))
  > resOrdered <− DE.Alfalfa[order(DE.
Alfalfa$padj),]
  > resSignificant <− subset(resOrdered, padj 
< 0.1)
 11. Save these results.
  > write.table(as.data.frame(resSignificant)
,file=‘Alfalfa_vs_Glucose.tsv’,sep=‘\t’)

4 Notes
 1. The Hungate system is a specialized apparatus for preparing 
anaerobic media and can be used to enable researchers to work 
with anaerobic cultures and media on the bench-top while 
maintaining strict anaerobic conditions. Readers are referred 
to the review by Wolfe for details of setting up and working 
with a Hungate system [ 15].
 2. Care must be taken to ensure that the media remains anaero -
bic. Resazurin is included in the media to serve as an oxygen 
indicator. The media will change colour from pale yellow/clear 
to pink if oxygen has been introduced into the media.
 3. Some carbon sources such as glucose will caramelize if auto -
claved for too long or at too high of temperature. Be sure to 
set the autoclave cycle appropriately to prevent this. It is also 
important to secure the cap on the bottle to prevent it from 
coming off during the autoclave cycle.
 4. This experiment will examine whether the particular microbe 
being studied utilize unique mechanisms to degrade the cell 
wall of monocot (alfalfa hay) and dicot plants (barley). The 
growth of cultures on glucose, or another simple sugar such as 
fructose, will be used to determine baseline protein production 
and will serve as a reference to identify proteins associated with 
the digestion of the plant cell wall.
 5. It is essential that cultures are grown under the same condi -
tions and are harvested at the same growth stage.
 6. The cell free growth media can be retained and used for pro -
teomic analysis of extracellular proteins expressed to decon -
struct the plant cell wall.
 7. Retain the cell free culture media for proteomic analysis. See 
the accompanying Chapter 22. Be careful when removing liq -
uid media so as not to lyse fungal cells. This will interfere with 
identification of secreted proteins.
 8. TRIzol contains phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate. Care 
should be taken when working with this reagent. Always wear 
gloves, proper personal protection equipment, and work in a 
fume hood.
Robert J. Gruninger et al.
295
 9. The sample will separate into a lower red organic phase and an 
upper colorless aqueous phase. All of the RNA will be in the 
aqueous phase. This should constitute roughly 50% of the vol -
ume in the tube.
 10. Placing tube in a heating block at 50–60  °C will help dissolve 
pellet.
 11. Carrying out both elution steps significantly improves yield. In 
our experience the concentration of the first and second elu -
tions are similar so skipping this step will result in a significant 
decrease in overall yield.
 12. A key determinant of the success or failure of a transcriptomic 
study is the quality of the RNA that is used as starting material. 
A commonly used metric to assess the extent of RNA degrada -
tion in a sample is the RNA integrity number, or RIN.  Samples 
with a RIN value of 8–10 (A RIN of ten means that no degra -
dation has occurred) are ideal for RNA-seq experiments. Using 
the approach for RNA extraction and purification outlined 
here our lab is consistently able to generate 5–10  μg of total 
RNA with RIN values >8 from 50  mL fungal cultures.
 13. The TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample preparation kit has been 
optimized for use with 0.1–4  μg of total RNA.  Using less than 
0.1 μg of starting material may result in inefficient ligation of 
adapters and low yields.
 14. Many of the steps involve the use of a magnetic stand that cap -
tures the magnetic beads that are used to purify the nucleic 
acids. Two potential stands are the Ambion Magnetic stand-  96 
(ThermoFisher) or the Agencourt SPRIPlate Super Magnetic 
Plate (Beckman Coulter).
 15. Reverse transcriptase is required for this step. This enzyme is 
not included in the Illumina kit and must be purchased sepa -
rately. As recommended by Illumina, our lab uses Superscript 
II Reverse Transcriptase from Invitrogen.
 16. The First Strand Master Mix with reverse transcriptase is not 
sensitive to freeze-thaw cycles however, it is advisable to pre -
pare small aliquots of this mixture to minimize the chances of 
contamination.
 17. The product of the first strand synthesis is an RNA:DNA 
duplex. Synthesis of second strand cDNA involves digesting 
the template RNA with RNAse H and replacing it with DNA 
using DNA polymerase I.  Strand specificity is achieved through 
the incorporation of dUTP in place of dTTP in the second 
strand. The product of this reaction is double stranded cDNA.
 18. At this point in the protocol samples can be safely stored in 
sealed tubes/plates for a week at −20 °C.
Transcriptomic Identification of Genes Involved in Lignocellulose Degradation

 19. This step adds a single adenine nucleotide to the 3 ′ end of 
the blunt fragments of end repaired, double stranded cDNA. 
This prevents the fragments from ligating to one another and 
facilitates ligation of fragments to adapters during the adapter 
ligation step.
 20. Illumina indexing adapters are ligated to the blunt ends of the 
double stranded cDNA prepared in the previous steps. These 
adapters serve multiple purposes including (1) binding to the 
flow cell during sequencing, (2) allowing for PCR based 
enrichment of adapter labeled DNA fragments and (3) barcod -
ing of samples when multiplexing several libraries into a single 
sequencing lane. The TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample prepa -
ration kit comes with 24 unique indexes. It is important to use 
the adapter combinations recommended by Illumina to ensure 
that colour balance is maintained during sequencing to mini -
mize the risk of base calling errors in the index region of the 
transcripts.
 21. This step uses polymerase chain reaction to selectively amplify 
cDNA fragments that have Illumina adapters ligated to both 
ends. Additionally, this step amplifies the amount of DNA in 
the library. The minimum number of amplification cycles 
should be used to prevent the introduction of amplification 
bias into the library.
 22. The presence of significant amounts of adapter dimers can 
interfere with the sequencing reaction. If present, gel-purify 
the amplified library prior to pooling libraries.
 23. The amount of DNA present in the library is a key determinant 
in obtaining optimal cluster density during sequencing. Use of 
too much or too little DNA can cause failure of the sequencing 
reaction.
 24. This step can be skipped if only one sample is being run on the 
sequencer.
 25. Most labs use commercial sequencing providers or core 
sequencing facilities for both library preparation and sequenc -
ing. The sequencing can be carried out using several instru -
ments including the Illumina MiSeq, Next-Seq, or Hi-Seq. 
The exact protocol that is required for each of these instru -
ments differs and users are encouraged to consult the Illumina 
website or your sequencing provider for details of this process. 
When choosing which sequencing approach to use for a study, 
consideration of the number of samples being analyzed, the 
complexity of the transcriptomes, and the experimental ques -
tion being asked are important variables. A useful resource to 
help users design experiments and determine the most appro -
priate experimental approach is the “Standards, Guidelines 
and best practices for RNA-seq” prepared by the ENCODE 
Robert J. Gruninger et al.
297
consortium in 2011 [ 16]. Users are also encouraged to consult 
the expertise of your service provider to identify the most 
appropriate approach.
 26. Adapters/Illumina_TruSeq_mRNA_adaptors.fa should con -
tain the sequences of the adapters used in the RNA-Seq library 
construction, in FASTA format; the -t parameter should be no 
more than the number of available processor cores.
 27. SORTMERNA should be set to the directory where 
SortMeRNA is installed.
 28. This command requires at least 30  GB of available RAM.
 29. The --k-max parameter should be an odd number at least 9 less 
than the read length; the -t parameter should be no more than 
the number of available processor cores.
 30. A summary of the transcriptome quality will be output in eval -
uation/transrating/assemblies.csv and quality statistics for 
each transcript will be output in evaluation/transrating/tran -
scripts/contigs.csv.
 31. Set BUSCO to the directory where BUSCO is installed. Set 
the -l parameter to an appropriate taxonomic group for which 
you have installed BUSCO data files. A summary of the 
results will be saved in evaluation/run_BUSCO-OGS/
short_summary_BUSCO-OGS.
 32. The functional significance of these differentially expressed 
transcripts can be assessed following functional annotation of 
the sequences.

Isolation and  Preparation of  Extracellular Proteins 
from Lignocellulose Degrading Fungi for  Comparative 
Proteomic Studies Using Mass Spectrometry
Robert  J. Gruninger, Adrian  Tsang, and  Tim A. McAllister
Abstract
Fungi utilize a unique mechanism of nutrient acquisition involving extracellular digestion. To understand the 
biology of these microbes, it is important to identify and characterize the function of proteins that are 
secreted and involved in this process. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a powerful tool to study 
complex mixtures of proteins and understand how the proteins produced by an organism change in response 
to different conditions. Many fungi are efficient decomposers of plant cell wall, and anaerobic fungi are well 
recognized for their ability to digest lignocellulose. Here, we outline a protocol for the enrichment and 
isolation of proteins secreted by anaerobic fungi after growth on simple (glucose) and complex (straw and 
alfalfa hay) carbon sources. We provide detailed instruction on generating protein fragments and preparing 
these for proteomic analysis using reversed phase chromatography and mass spectrometry.

1 Introduction
The efficiency with which the anaerobic fungi (phylum 
Neocallimastigomycota) degrade plant biomass is well recognized 
and in recent years has received renewed interest [ 1, 2]. Aerobic 
fungi utilize powerful oxidative enzymes to break down lignin and 
expose cellulose and hemicellulose [ 3]. This mechanism is not 
available to anaerobic fungi and these microbes have likely evolved 
a unique approach for breaking lignin-carbohydrate bonds. 
Extensive genomic and transcriptomic efforts have been under -
taken and this work has revealed that these fungi utilize a large 
repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZY enzymes) to 
degrade the plant cell wall [ 4–6]. Many of these enzymes show low 
levels of sequence identity to proteins that have been characterized 
to date [ 4–6]. Fungi obtain nutrients from their environment by 
secreting a potent mixture of enzymes that digest carbohydrates, 
proteins, and lipids.

Identifying and characterizing secreted proteins is essential to 
fully understand the biology of these microbes. Proteomics is a pow -
erful tool to study complex mixtures of proteins and understand how 
the proteins expressed by an organism change in response to different 
conditions. The proteome is an inherently complex system to analyze 
due to its dynamic nature. The composition of the proteome changes 
and is dependent on a number of factors such as cell cycle stage, 
metabolic state, and environmental conditions. Selecting a method 
that enables specific fractions of the proteome to be targeted for analy -
sis is crucial to the design of successful proteomics experiments.
A combination of computational and experimental tools can 
be used to predict and identify secreted proteins. The commonly 
used bioinformatic program SignalP predicts whether a protein is 
secreted by identifying the presence of an N-terminal secretory sig -
nal peptide [ 7]. One of the primary drawbacks to this approach is 
the lack of selectivity in distinguishing extracellular proteins from 
resident proteins of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticu -
lum. Consequently, many false positives may be generated when 
bioinformatically predicting extracellular proteins [ 8]. Proteomics 
studies examining the soluble extracellular fraction of microbial 
cultures by protein mass spectrometry can be used to provide 
strong direct evidence that detected proteins are indeed extracel -
lular. A key aspect of proteomic identification of proteins is the 
ability to search peptide fingerprints against a database of known 
proteins. This requires the organism being studied, or a close 
homologue, to have a well-annotated genome and/or transcrip -
tomes that can serve as this database.
In this chapter, we will provide a detailed protocol for qualita -
tively examining what effect varying the carbon source used to grow 
lignocellulose degrading fungi has on the composition of the exo-
proteome. We will specifically provide information on the growth of 
cultures, isolation and concentration of secreted proteins, in solution 
trypsin digestion of proteins, and preparation of peptides for mass 
spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1). We will not go into step-by-step 
details of results interpretation as this analysis area is study depen -
dent and there are a number of approaches that can be applied. 
Our laboratories work on the biochemical mechanisms of plant cell 
wall digestion in the phylum Neocallimastigomycota and these cul -
tures will be used specifically as an example of proteome analysis. 
However, it should be noted that this approach can be used to examine 
the exo-proteome of any microbe grown in liquid culture.

3 Methods
Grow anaerobic fungi using aseptic technique under strict 
 anaerobic conditions. When conducting comparative experiments 
it is important to have at least two biological replicates to allow 
statistical analysis to be carried out. If possible, three biological 
replicates are advised. This experimental design can be used for 
comparative analysis of the exo-proteome of anaerobic fungi grown 
using three different carbon sources: (1) glucose, (2) barley straw, 
(3) alfalfa hay ( see Note 6 ). To determine basal protein secretion 2.4 Peptide

by fungi, grow three cultures using glucose as the sole carbon 
source. To identify proteins that are secreted by the fungus to 
break down the plant cell wall, grow three cultures with barley 
straw and three cultures with alfalfa hay provided as the sole carbon 
source ( see Note 7 ).
 1. When media has cooled, inoculate cultures with fungal mycelia 
and incubate at 39  °C under anaerobic conditions for 72  h. Do 
not shake flasks ( see Note 8 ).
 2. Using a vacuum filter fitted with a Büchner funnel and 
Whatmann quantitative 50 fast flow filter paper (GE Lifesciences, 
Mississauga ON), carefully separate the liquid culture from the 
fungal mycelia and any insoluble material ( see Note 9 ).
 3. Further clarify the supernatant by centrifugation at 12,000–
15,000  × g for 15  min at 4  °C. This cell-free culture superna -
tant contains the fungal proteins secreted during growth.
 4. Carefully transfer supernatant without disturbing pellet and 
make several 1.5 mL tubes containing clarified cell-free culture 
supernatant. Freeze any tubes that will not be used right away 
for protein isolation which can be used as backups, technical 
replicates, or for additional experiments.
Contamination of samples with keratin can be minimized by always 
wearing gloves when handling material and samples, working in a 
laminar flow hood, using a dedicated set of pipettes and pipette 
tips, and filtering solutions when possible. Most detergents should 
be avoided as these can interfere with sample ionization and are 
difficult to remove from samples. All solutions should be freshly 
prepared using HPLC grade reagents and regularly checked to 
ensure they do not contain visible particles or fibers.
 1. Quantify the total protein concentration in the supernatant 
using the RC DC protein assay kit (Biorad, Mississauga, ON) 
as described by the manufacturer. It is important to know how 
much protein is in your sample so that the correct amount of 
protease can be used to fragment the protein into peptides.
 2. Run an SDS-PAGE gel to visually inspect the presence of pro -
tein bands after Coomassie staining the gel. If no protein bands 
are visible on the SDS-PAGE gel, concentrate proteins by TCA 
precipitation.
 1. Mix one volume of 100% (w/v) TCA to four volumes of 
clarified cell-free culture supernatant and incubate for 10  min 
at 4 °C. A white precipitate should form.
 2. Pellet precipitated protein by centrifugation at 10–15,000  × g 
for 10  min. Decant supernatant.
 3. Wash pellet with 500  μL of chilled acetone ( −20 °C). Break up 
the pellet by pipetting up and down.3.2 Isolation

Decant supernatant.
 5. Repeat steps 3  and 4 two more times for a total of three ace -
tone washes.
 6. Dry pellet in fume hood for 30–60  min. Residual acetone will 
reduce the ability to redissolve protein pellet.
 7. Dissolve pellet in 0.1% (W/V) AALS II in 100  mM NH 4HCO 3 
pH 8.5. Solubilizing TCA precipitated protein can be difficult 
and conditions may need to be optimized for different samples.
 1. Resuspend an appropriate amount of sample material (5  μg of 
total protein) in 100  mM NH 4HCO 3, pH 8.5 buffer.
 2. Check that protein sample is between pH  8.0 and 8.5 by spot -
ting a small amount on pH paper and adjust if necessary with 
1.0 M NH 4HCO 3.
 3. Add an appropriate amount of AALS II solution to achieve a 
final concentration of 0.1%. This detergent facilitates trypsin 
digestion by denaturing proteins and has the advantage of not 
interfering with the subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis since it is 
broken down in acidic conditions.
 4. Add the 100  mM DTT stock solution to samples to achieve a 
final concentration of 10  mM DTT (e.g., 10  μL of 100  mM 
DTT per 90  μL of sample). Incubate at room temperature for 
30 min. This will reduce disulfide bonds in the protein.
 5. Add the 500  mM iodoacetamide stock solution to fully reduced 
samples to achieve a final concentration of 50  mM (e.g., add 
10 μL per 90  μL of reduced sample). Incubate in the dark at 
room temperature for 30  min.
 6. Adjust concentration of DTT to 50  mM to quench remaining 
iodoacetamide.
 1. Digest proteins into peptides by adding trypsin at a ratio of 
1:50 trypsin:protein. Vortex sample to mix and incubate with 
gentle agitation at 37  °C for 4–18  h (see Note 10 ).
 2. Stop protease cleavage by adding 5–10  μL of 1% (v/v) TFA to 
decrease the pH of sample to 2–3. Leave at room temperature 
for at least 30  min to allow for the degradation of the AALS II 
(see Note 11 ).
Prior to analysis of samples by mass spectrometry, all salts must be 
removed and the sample placed in a mass spectrometry-compatible 
solvent system. Several chromatography based commercial systems 
are available to quickly desalt and buffer exchange protein samples. 
We will describe the use of ZipTips (EMD Millipore, Etobicoke, 
ON) for this purpose. ZipTips are pipette tips containing a small 3.4 Reductive

amount of C18 resin in the tip with binding capacity of up to 5  μg 
of protein. A similar product called Pierce C18 tip is available from 
Pierce (ThermoFishcer Scientific, Mississauga, ON) and has a 
binding capacity of 8–80  μg and can be used for samples with 
larger amounts of protein.
 1. Place ZipTip on a standard 10- μL pipettor. Single-channel and 
multi-channel pipettors are compatible and either can be used 
to accommodate the required throughput for a particular 
experiment.
 2. To bind sample, aspirate into ZipTip and pipette up and down 
several times. The protein/peptides will bind to the resin in 
the tip while the buffer salt components will not.
 3. To exchange buffers, aspirate the ZipTip with bound protein/
peptides into the mass spectrometry-compatible solvent. Wash 
the resin with several pipette tip volumes to fully exchange 
solvent.
 4. Elute the resin-bound sample material directly into a fresh 
tube with a volume of high organic solvent. Typically, 80% 
Acetonitrile: 0.1% Formic acid (v/v) is used as eluent. The 
sample will be eluted from the resin in a volume of 1–4  μL.
 5. Adjust the volume of the eluent solution such that the final 
acetonitrile concentration is no more than 5% (v/v).
If LC-MS/MS involves reversed phase separation of peptide 
on a C18 column, a suitable solvent system is 0.1% (v/v) formic 
acid, 5% (v/v) acetonitrile ( see Note 12 ). The sample is now ready 
for analysis by mass spectrometry ( see Note 13 ).
4 Notes
 1. Always use personal protective equipment when working with 
TCA as it can cause chemical burns.
 2. Pierce Trypsin Protease (ThermoFischer Sci) is recommended. 
This trypsin is highly purified, free from chymotrypsin, and has 
been chemically modified to enhance its stability and prevent 
autolysis during protease digestion.
 3. The Hungate system is a specialized apparatus for preparing 
anaerobic media and can be used to enable researchers to work 
with anaerobic cultures and media on the bench-top while 
maintaining strict anaerobic conditions. Readers are referred 
to the review by Wolfe for details of setting up and working 
with a Hungate system [ 9].
 4. Care must be taken to ensure that the media remains anaerobic. 
Resazurin is included in the media to serve as an oxygen 
indicator. The media will change color from pale yellow/clear 
to pink if oxygen has been introduced into the media.
Robert J. Gruninger et al.

 5. Some carbon sources such as glucose will caramelize if autoclaved 
for too long or at too high of temperature. Be sure to set the 
autoclave cycle appropriately to prevent this. It is also impor -
tant to secure the cap on bottle to prevent it from coming off 
during autoclave cycle.
 6. Barley is a dicot and alfalfa is a monocot so this experiment will 
also provide an opportunity to examine whether these fungi 
utilize unique mechanisms to degrade the cell wall of monocot 
and dicot plants. The growth of cultures on glucose, or another 
simple sugar such as fructose, is used to determine baseline 
protein production and to serve as a reference to identify proteins 
that are produced to digest the plant cell wall.
 7. The complex carbon sources included in the study can be sub -
stituted to address the particular goals of different end-users
 8. It is essential that cultures be grown under the same condi -
tions, and are harvested at the same growth stage. It is also 
important to be gentle when growing fungal cultures and pre -
paring cell-free culture supernatant to minimize the chance of 
cell lysis and leakage of intracellular proteins into the media.
 9. Transfer fungal mycelia into a separate falcon tube and freeze 
in liquid nitrogen. Retain this material for RNA isolation 
which can subsequently be used for comparative transcrip -
tomic studies.
 10. Trypsin is optimally active at pH  8.0 and it is advisable to check 
that the pH of your sample is in this range by spotting a small 
volume on pH paper. The ratio of protease to sample and time 
of digestion may need to be optimized if digestion is 
incomplete.
 11. Trypsin digestion is only one approach for fragmenting pro -
teins prior to mass spectroscopy. Other proteases such as LysC, 
chymotrypsin, AspN or chemicals such as cyanogen bromide 
can also be used to generate peptides [ 10].
 12. Prior to injection of peptides into the mass spectrometer, pep -
tides are bound to a C18 reversed phase column in an aqueous 
buffer and eluted using a linear gradient of increasing acetoni -
trile. To maximize peptide retention to the column, it is impor -
tant to minimize the organic solvent content of the sample.
 13. The protocol outlined here provides users with the tools to 
isolate the proteins secreted by a microbe when grown on a 
particular carbon source. This protocol can be applied to other 
experimental questions aimed at examining the effect of many 
growth variables on protein production in microbes. For most 
users, mass spectrometry analysis of samples will be carried out 
by commercial service providers, core facilities, or collaborating 
labs with expertise in proteomics. There are a range of 
approaches for the analysis of proteomic data and users are
