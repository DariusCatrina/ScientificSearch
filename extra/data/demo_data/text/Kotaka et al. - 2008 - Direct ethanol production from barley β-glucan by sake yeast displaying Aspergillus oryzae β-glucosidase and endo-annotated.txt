Three β-glucosidase- and two endoglucanase-encoding genes were cloned from Aspergillus
oryzae , and their gene products were displayed on the cell surface of the sake yeast, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae  GRI-117-UK. GRI-117-UK/pUDB7 displaying β-glucosidase AO090009000356 showed
the highest activity against various substrates and efficiently produced ethanol from cellobiose.
On the other hand, GRI-117-UK/pUDCB displaying endoglucanase AO090010000314 efficiently
degraded barley β-glucan to glucose and smaller cellooligosaccharides. GRI-117-UK/pUDB7CB
codisplaying both β-glucosidase AO090009000356 and endoglucanase AO090010000314 was con-
structed. When direct ethanol fermentation from 20 g/ l barley β-glucan as a model substrate was
performed with the codisplaying strain, the ethanol concentration reached 7.94 g/ l after 24 h of
fermentation. The conversion ratio of ethanol from β-glucan was 69.6% of the theoretical ethanol
concentration produced from 20 g/ l barley β-glucan. These results showed that sake yeast display-
ing A. oryzae  cellulolytic enzymes can be used to produce ethanol from cellulosic materials. Our
constructs have higher ethanol production potential than the laboratory constructs previously re-
ported.
[Key words: sake yeast, Aspergillus oryzae , β-glucosidase, endoglucanase, cell surface engineering, cellulosic

Ethanol from biomass is called bioethanol, a substitute
for fossil  fuels  (1). Particularly, cellulosic biomass, such as
agricultural and forestry residues, exists in huge quantitiesand is remarkable because it is not a food material. Ethanol
production from cellulose is performed via the degradation
of cellulose to cellooligosaccharides and glucose, followedby the conversion of glucose to ethanol by microorganisms
such as yeast.
Generally, to degrade cellulose, acid treatment with sul-
fate is carried out, and then the solution is neutralized andused for ethanol fermentation. However, the residues by neu-
tralization generate environmental load. On the other hand,degradation by enzymes, such as endoglucanase (EC. 3.2.1.4),
β-glucosidase (EC. 3.2.1.21) and others, proceeds under mild
conditions and emits less residues. The fermentation of glu-
cose to ethanol is performed by various microorganisms in-
cluding yeast. To date, the direct production of ethanol from
cellulosic materials has been under development; the labo-ratory strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  displays cellu-lolytic enzymes on its cell surface and can simultaneously
saccharify and ferment  (2). However, the growth  and etha-
nol productivity of laboratory yeasts are inferior to those of
practical strains, including sake yeasts.
In Japanese sake brewing, koji mold ( Aspergillus oryzae )
and sake yeast ( S. cerevisiae ) are used. Koji mold sacchari-
fies rice starch and sake yeast ferments glucose to ethanol.
This method is called simultaneous saccharification and fer-
mentation. The enzymes that the koji mold secretes are used
in making Japanese sake, soy sauce, miso, and so on. Koji
mold produces a large amount and many types of enzymeunder various conditions. On the other hand, sake yeast rap-idly proliferates, vigorously ferments, has high ethanol re-
sistance, and is stable in terms of quality. Particularly, sake
yeast can produce ethanol until the ethanol concentrationreaches approximately 20% (v/v). However, S. cerevisiae
cannot utilize cellulosic materials.
Previously, two endoglucanases were cloned from A.
oryzae , and their gene products were overproduced in A.
oryzae  and characterized (3, 4), whereas two β-glucosidases
produced by A. oryzae  were also purified and characterized
(5, 6). Recently, it has been revealed that A. oryzae  has

many cellulose degradation enzymes, because genomic in-
formation  on A. oryzae  had been disclosed (7).
In this study, the genes of A. oryzae  cellulolytic enzymes
were cloned on the basis of genomic information. In addi-tion, the cell surface display technique is applied to sake
yeast, and then the ethanol production was achieved using
constructed strains that display β-glucosidase and endoglu-
canase from A. oryzae  on their cell surface.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and media The microbial strains and plasmids used
in this study  are listed in Table 1. The sake yeast strain GRI-117-UK
was obtained by ethyl methane sulphonate mutagenesis of the wild
type of sake yeast Kyokai no. 9 (Brewing Society of Japan), and
then selected using the 5-fluoroorotic acid medium  (8) and α-amino-
adipate medium  (9). E. coli was grown in Luria–Bertani medium
containing 10 g/ l Polypepton, 5 g/ l yeast extract, 10 g/ l sodium chlo-
ride and 100 mg/ l ampicillin. Yeast was cultivated aerobically at
30°C in YPD medium (10 g/ l yeast extract, 20 g/ l Polypepton and
20 g/ l glucose) or SD medium (6.7 g/ l yeast nitrogen base without
amino acids, 20 g/ l glucose and appropriate supplements).
Construction of plasmids To acquire the genes whose in-
trons were eliminated, junction PCR was performed using theprimers  listed  in Table 2. At first, each  set of primers and A. oryzae
chromosomal DNA were used to amplify a part of the gene by
PCR. Next, the first PCR products and the primers annealing the
5′-end and 3 ′-end of the gene were used to amplify the full length
of the gene. The second PCR product was digested with SalI and
HpaI and then inserted into plasmid pK113, containing the SED1
promoter (10),  the secretion signal  sequence of Rhizopus oryzae
glucoamylase gene, 3 ′-half of α-agglutinin gene  as the  anchor (11)
and URA3  selectable marker, which was digested with SalI and SmaI.
The plasmid for displaying both β-glucosidase B7 and endoglucanase
CelB was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment containing the
SED1  promoter, CelB gene and 3 ′-half of α-agglutinin was ampli-
fied from pUDCB by PCR, using the primers, Psed800(AatII)F (5 ′-
GGCGACGTCTTGGATATAGAAAATTAA-3 ′) and CAS1(AatII)R
(5′-CGGCGACGTCTTTGATTATGTTCTTTCTA-3 ′), and then di-
gested with AatII. The resulting fragment was inserted into plas-
mid pUDB7 digested with AatII, yielding pUDB7CB.
Yeast transformation The expression plasmids were intro-
duced into S. cerevisiae  GRI-117-UK by the lithium acetate method
(12). We selected the transformants  that showed the highest activ-
ity using p-nitrophenyl 
β-D-glucopyranoside or barley β-glucan asthe substrate.
Enzyme  assays β-Glucosidase activity was measured in
50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37 °C with 1 mM p-nitro-
phenyl β-D-glucopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl β-D-cellobioside, p-nitro-
phenyl β-D-cellotrioside, cellobiose, gentiobiose and laminaribiose
as the substrates. The cells were aerobically cultivated in YPD me-dium at 30 °C for 48 h, harvested by centrifugation, washed with
distilled water, and resuspended in a reaction mixture with the op-
tical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. After the reaction, the supernatants
were separated by centrifugation, and the p-nitrophenol released or
the reducing sugar remaining was determined by measuring the ab-
sorbance  at 415 nm or by  the Somogyi–Nelson method (13), re-
spectively. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount
of enzyme that released 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol or glucose from
the substrate per min.
Endoglucanase activity was confirmed by analyzing the prod-
ucts released from barley β-glucan by the sake yeast displaying en-
doglucanases. After cultivation in YPD medium for 48 h at 30 °C,
the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilledwater. Then the cells were disrupted using CelLytic-Y (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and resuspended in a reaction mix-
ture containing 20 g/ l barley β-glucan (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 mM
sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). After the hydrolysis reaction at
37°C, the supernatants were separated by centrifugation. The prod-
ucts were detected by  thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (14).
Ethanol production The transformants were aerobically
precultivated for 24 h and then cultivated in YPD medium at 30 °C
for 48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resus-
pended in 50 g/ l cellobiose (pH 5.0) or 20 g/ l barley β-glucan (pH
5.0) with the optical density of 5.0 or 20 at 600 nm, respectively.The small-scale fermentation (100 ml of cellobiose solution in a250-ml closed bottle or 20 ml of barley β-glucan solution in a 50-ml
closed bottle) was carried out anaerobically at 30 °C. The ethanol
concentration was measured by gas chromatography. The gas chro-matograph (model GC-8A; Shimadzu, Kyoto) was operated under
the following conditions: Gasukuropack54; temperatures of col-
umn and injector, 180 and 250 °C, respectively; N
2 carrier gas flow
rate, 60 ml/min.

are three A. oryzae  β-glucosidase genes in the glycoside hy-
drolases family 1 (GH1). For one of them, the initiation
codon and intron could not be determined. We selected two
β-glucosidases of GH1, β-glucosidases B3 and B6. β-Glu-
cosidase B7 was selected as one of the GH3 enzymes that
were homologous to the well-known β-glucosidase from A.
aculeatus  (15, 16). On the other  hand, we cloned two endo-
glucanase genes, CelA and CelB, as previously reported forthe enzymes that A. oryzae  secretes. All of the cloned genes
in this study except for celB were interrupted by introns. Wecloned these genes by fusing each exon because the introns
of A. oryzae  cannot be removed in yeast cells. The lengths
of the genes of the intronless β-glucosidases B3, B6 and B7,
and endoglucanases CelA and CelB were 1317, 1521, 2586,720 and 1251 bp, respectively. These gene fragments were
inserted into the expression vector pK113 (Fig. 1), and then,
to transform S. cerevisiae  GRI-117-UK, the constructed plas-
mids were digested with StuI. Each linear DNA fragment
was introduced into the yeast chromosomal DNA by homol-ogous recombination using the lithium acetate method.TABLE 2. PCR primers used in this study

Enzyme activities The β-glucosidase activities on the
cell surface of the yeast transformants are listed in Table 3.
The β-glucosidase activity was determined using synthetic
substrates and glucobioses. After the yeast transformants
were cultivated aerobically at 30 °C for 48 h in YPD me-
dium, the yeast strain displaying β-glucosidase B7 (GRI-
117-UK/pUDB7) showed the highest activity among thesetransformants against various substrates, particularly p-ni-
trophenyl β-
D-glucopyranoside, cellobiose and gentiobiose,
while no activity was detected in strain GRI-117-UK/pK113
used as a control  (Table 3). In  the experiments on ethanol
production, we decided to use strain GRI-117-UK/pUDB7
that displays β-glucosidase B7.
 To confirm the endoglucanase activity, TLC analysis was
performed. We measured the endoglucanase activity after
the disruption of the harvested cells because glucose re-
leased from barley β-glucan was taken up by yeast cells assoon as degradation occurred. After the yeast transformants
were cultivated aerobically in YPD medium at 30 °C for
48 h, the disrupted cells (OD600=5.0) were used in the re-
action at 16 h, and the degradation of barley β-glucan to the
smaller oligosaccharides and glucose was detected (Fig. 2).
The yeast strain displaying CelB (GRI-117-UK/pUDCB)produced more cellobiose and glucose than the yeast strain
displaying CelA (GRI-117-UK/pUDCA). No activity was
detected in the yeast strain harboring the control plasmid(GRI-117-UK/pK113). To produce ethanol from cellulose,
we decided to use strain GRI-117-UK/pUDCB that displays
endoglucanase CelB.
Ethanol production from cellobiose Direct fermenta-
tion from cellobiose to ethanol was performed using the yeaststrain displaying β-glucosidase B7 (GRI-117-UK/pUDB7).
The highest ethanol concentration was approximately 21.6 g/ l
after 48 h of fermentation  (Fig. 3). The ethanol  yield was
0.432 g/g of cellobiose added. This value corresponded to
80.3% of the theoretical ethanol concentration produced from
50 g/ l cellobiose. No ethanol was produced by GRI-117-
UK/pK113 used as the control.
Ethanol
 production  from barley  β-glucan Barley
β-glucan was used as the model biomass of cellulosic mate-
rial. For the direct fermentation of barley β-glucan to etha-
nol, a cellulose-utilizing yeast strain was constructed by in-tegrating plasmid pUDB7CB, which made the yeast codis-FIG. 1. Expression plasmids for cell surface display of β-glucosi-

play β-glucosidase B7 and endoglucanase CelB on the cell
surface. With the resulting cellulose-utilizing yeast strain,
GRI-117-UK/pUDB7CB, direct ethanol fermentation from
cellulose was performed. The highest ethanol concentrationwas 7.94 g/l after  24 h of fermentation (Fig.  4). This corre-
sponded to 69.6% of the theoretical ethanol concentrationproduced from 20 g/ l barley β-glucan. A similar result was
obtained when the yeast strains, GRI-117-UK/pUDB7 and
GRI-117-UK/pUDCB were simultaneously used. GRI-117-
UK/pUDCB produced 0.59 g/ l ethanol, while GRI-117-
UK/pK113 and GRI-117-UK/pUDB7 produced no ethanol.
DISCUSSION
Three genes encoding β-glucosidase were cloned from A.
oryzae  and the gene products were displayed on the yeast
cell surface. We could obtain the useful genes efficiently byexploiting the A. oryzae  genomic information. According to
the genomic information, there are 26 β-glucosidase-encod-
ing genes. However, only a few β-glucosidases were reported
before (5, 6),  and others are not  considered  to be produced
by A. oryzae  cells. β-Glucosidases displayed on the yeast
cell surface showed various substrate specificities. The activ-ity of GRI-117-UK/pUDB7 was higher than those of GRI-117-UK/pUDB3 and GRI-117-UK/pUDB6. β-Glucosidases
B3 and B6 belong to GH1, and β-glucosidase B7 belongs to
GH3. The structural difference among these enzymes wouldaffect the activity. β-Glucosidase B7 shows high homology
with A. aculeatus  β-glucosidase 1 (79%) and A. niger  β-glu-
cosidase (77%), which have very high β-glucosidase activi-
ties (15–17). β-Glucosidase B7 showed high activities for
all the substrates used in this study. Because β-glucosidase
B7 showed high activity for cellobiose, it is considered suit-able for degrading cellooligosaccharides. In contrast, there
are some endoglucanase-encoding genes in the A. oryzae
genomic DNA. The endoglucanases CelA and CelB could
degrade barley β-glucan to cellooligosaccharides and glu-
cose. CelB can degrade more efficiently than CelA (Fig. 2).
GH7 enzymes, to which CelB belongs, exist only in eukary-otes, but GH12 enzymes, to which CelA belongs, are widely
expressed in various species. It was reported that Tricho-derma viride  endoglucanase I, a GH7 enzyme, (18) and
Thermotoga neapolitana  endo-1,4-glucanase B, a GH12 en-
zyme,  (19) can degrade cellooligosaccharides to glucose. In
this study, A. oryzae  CelB also produced smaller cellooligo-
saccharides and glucose, and it was considered that A. oryzae
CelB is comparable to other enzymes such as the T. viride
endoglucanase I. The sake yeasts displaying CelB showed
high activity for barley β-glucan. This strain is expected to
degrade cellulose.
Yeast S. cerevisiae  cannot decompose and assimilate cel-
lulose. To address these problems, the cell surface engineer-
ing was applied to an industrial strain, sake yeast. In our
study, sake yeast strains displaying β-glucosidase and endo-
glucanase from A. oryzae  on the cell surface were constructed.
Displaying multiple types of enzyme on the cell surface is
useful. We could use only one strain to degrade barley β-glu-
can because a codisplaying strain was constructed. GRI-
117-UK/pUDB7CB, displaying both β-glucosidase B7 and
endoglucanase CelB, had as much β-glucosidase activity as
GRI-117-UK/pUDB7, but the endoglucanase activity wasnot determined because the degradation products of barley
β-glucan (cellooligosaccharides and glucose) were not found
(data not shown). It is assumed that the cellooligosaccha-
rides were degraded to glucose by the β-glucosidase on the
cell surface and the yeast immediately consumed glucose.
The endoglucanase of GRI-117-UK/pUDB7CB indirectly
showed ethanol  production from  barley β-glucan (Fig.  4).
In the previous report (20), the laboratory yeast  MT8-1
displaying A. aculeatus  β-glucosidase (MT8-1/BGL) was
constructed. The transformant (OD
600 of 20) produced 19.3 g/ l
ethanol from 50 g/ l cellobiose in 24 h. In contrast, in this
study, the sake yeast GRI-117-UK/pUDB7 (OD600 of 5.0)
produced 21.6 g/ l ethanol from 50 g/ l cellobiose in 48 h. The
theoretical ethanol productions from 50 g/ l cellobiose were
71.7% (MT8-1/BGL) and 80.3% (GRI-117-UK/pUDB7).The conversion rate of ethanol from cellobiose was higher
using GRI-117-UK/pUDB7. In another report, MT8-1 dis-
playing both A. aculeatus  β-glucosidase and TrichodermaFIG. 3. Production of ethanol from 50 g/ l cellobiose. Symbols: circles,

reesei  endoglucanase (MT8-1/pBG211/pEG23u31H6 ）was
constructed (2).  The transformant produced 16.5 g/l ethanol
from 45 g/ l barley β-glucan in 50 h, and this corresponded
to 64.2% of the ethanol concentration theoretically produced
from 45 g/ l β-glucan. In contrast, in this study, the sake yeast
we constructed (GRI-117-UK/pUDB7CB) produced 7.94 g/ l
ethanol from 20 g/ l barley β-glucan in 24 h, and this corre-
sponded to 69.6% of the ethanol concentration theoreticallyproduced from 20 g/ l β-glucan. The conversion rate of etha-
nol
 from barley  β-glucan  was higher  using  GRI-117-UK/
pUDB7CB. These results raise the possibility that cellulose-utilizing sake yeasts are useful for ethanol production. GRI-
117-UK/pUDCB displaying CelB produced only 0.59 g/ l
ethanol from 20 g/ l barley β-glucan because it could not re-
lease glucose sufficiently. Therefore, the codisplaying strainGRI-117-UK/pUDB7CB was demonstrated to be useful for
the direct ethanol production from cellulose.
Now, in the United States and Brazil, ethanol is produced
from sugarcane and corn, and used as fuel on a large scale.However, these carbon sources could be eaten, so it is hopedthat the biomass that could not be eaten, such as cellulose, is
used. Actually, food prices are rising because bioethanol is
produced from starch. In this study, our results revealed thatthe combination of sake yeast and koji mold enzymes is very
attractive for biomass conversion to energy. In addition, thecellulose-utilizing sake yeast GRI-117-UK/pUDB7CB stillhas lysine auxotrophy that can be used for displaying more
β-glucosidases and endoglucanases, or other glycoside hy-
drolases. The genes encoding other cellulose-degrading en-
zymes such as cellobiohydrolase and exoglucanase also exist
in the A. oryzae  genome. We now attempt to display cello-
biohydrolase and/or exoglucanase on the cell surface of GRI-
117-UK/pUDB7CB. The enhancement of cellulose-degrad-
ing enzyme activities will lead more efficient ethanol pro-
duction. The cellulose-utilizing sake yeasts constructed inthis study are expected to produce ethanol from cellulose
efficiently.
