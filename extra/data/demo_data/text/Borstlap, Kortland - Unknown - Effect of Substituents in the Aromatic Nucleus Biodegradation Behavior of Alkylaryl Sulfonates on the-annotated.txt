Abstract 
Taking the results of methylene blue analysis 
as a yardstick for biodegradability, substituents 
in the benzene ring of linear alkylaryl sulfonates 
(CHa, C2H5, OH) greatly deteriorate the aerobic 
biodegradation characteristics of these products: 
adaptation time, amount of hard residue, and, 
to a lesser extent, rate of biodegradation. Replace- 
ment of one long alkyl chain by two short ones 
of the same total length also retards biodegrada- 
tion. When the benzene ring is replaced by a 
thiophene ring, adaptation is improved. 
Introduction 
T IlE RELATION BETWEEN the aerobic biodegradation 
of an anionic detergent and its structure has in 
recent years been studied intensively (1-5). The 
general conclusion is that biodegradation is slower as 
the hydrophobic part of the molecule is more branched 
and the hydrophilic group shifts from the end to the 
middle of the molecule. It is also affected by molec- 
ular weight. 
Experiments with alkylbenzene sulfonates reported 
in the literature were restricted to variations in struc- 
ture and size of the alkyl chain and position of the 
hydrophilic group. It was found that not only the 
aromatic nucleus itself has a retarding effect but also 
that branching of the alkyl chain affects biodegrada- 
tion adversely. 
Whether or not the influence of detergent structure 
on biodegradation can be established clearly depends 
on the test method which is employed. The influence 
of small structural differences will go undetected 
under severe test conditions but will become apparent 
when conditions are milder. 
A mild test was used to study the influence on 
biodegradation of a) substituents in the benzene 
nucleus of alkylbenzene sulfonates and b) replacement 
of the benzene ring by a thiophene ring. The results 
are presented in this paper. 
Test Methods 
The literature describes a wide variety of methods 
in the study of the aerobic biodegradation of deter- gents in the laboratory. Three categories can be 
distinguished, viz., dynamic (6,7), semidynamic (8), 
and static procedures (9-12). 
An example of the dynamic method is the legal 
German test. The detergent is fed continuously to 
the biodegradation system. After an arbitrary time of 
biodegradation the amount of residual detergent is 
determined. This operation is repeated several times, 
and the average percentage of residual detergent is 
regarded as a measure of biodegradability. 
In a semidynamic test, detergent feeding is inter- 
mittent, but for the rest it resembles the dynamic 
method. 
The static test method differs from the continuous 
techniques in that the detergent is added in one pass, 
and the degradation is followed as a function of time. 
These procedures all have their merits and de- 
merits. The continuous and semieontinuous tech- 
niques more or less simulate an activated-sludge sew- 
age plant whereas a static method can be taken to 
represent the behavior of a detergent in public waters. 
The dynamic method, which only measures the 
amount of residual detergent, gives no information 
on the rate of biodegradation and the biological be- 
havior of ~he residual detergent. In consequence, it 
might not distinguish between two surfactant systems 
of which the one biodegrades at a medium rate and 
the other consists of a mixture of a soft material and 
a bioresistant detergent. 
On the other hand, the static method offers the 
advantage that, in one test, data are obtained on 
adaptation time, biodegradation rate, and the amount 
of detergent degrading slowly or not at all (the hard 
residue). This is why a static die-away test was 
preferred in the investigation. 
Analytical Methods 
To evaluate the biodegradability of anionic deter- 
gents, various analytical techniques can in principle 
be used, viz., colorimetric analysis, Warburg manom- 
etry, B0D determination, GLC analysis after 
desulfonation, the radioactive-tracer technique, and 
surface-tension measurements. Although these meth- 
ods may give valuable data, each has its distinct

limitations, which often make the results difficult to 
interpret. 
The method most utilized is the colorimetric method 
according to Longwell-Maniece (13,14). This tech- 
nique is based on the capability of a cationic dyestuff 
to form a complex with the anionic surfactant. The 
dye is, in general, methylene blue. The complex is 
extracted with chloroform, and the color intensity is 
measured. The amount of nondegraded surfaetant is 
reported. However partially bio-oxidized molecules 
(intermediate degradation products) do not show up 
(15). Thus no answer is obtained to the question of 
how far the bio-oxidation has progressed. For lack of 
a better method the co]orimetric technique has been 
adopted internationally and in some countries even 
legally, which is the reason this procedure was utilized. 
Experimental 
The static test employed to compare the rate of 
biodegradation of anionic detergents with different 
structures was a river die-away test, in which the 
bacteria concentration is low. Degradation proceeds 
slowly, which ensures proper differentiation. 
Test Procedure 
Twenty liters of river-water (IJ-water) were sam- 
pled and filtered through cotton wool to remove solid 
particles. To 990 ml of filtered water 10 ml of a 
1000-ppm detergent solution were added so the 
resultant mixture had an initial detergent concentra- 
tion of 10 ppm. The solution was stored in the dark 
at ambient temperature (approximately 20C) in open 
bottles to allow oxygen uptake. At suitable intervals 
samples were taken, and the content of nondegraded 
detergent was determined according to the methylene 
blue method (12,13).

FIO. 1. Biodegradation of various types of anionic detergents 
according to the y-water storage test: 1. lauryl alcohol sulfate, 
2. dodecylthiophene sulfonate, 3. dodecylbenzene sulfonate 
(ex-n-dodecene), 4. linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (ex-cracked 
wax olefins or ex-n-paraflins), 5. dodecyl-p-xylene sulfonate, 
6. dodecylethylbenzcne sulfonate, 7. dodecyl-o-xylene sulfonate,

hexene), 11. dodeeyl-m-xylene sulfonate. moiety of the alkylbenzene su]fonate molecule. This 
study however was to determine whether the presence 
of extra substituents (CH3, C2H5, OH) in the benzene 
ring of an alkylbenzene sulfonate has any influence 
on its biological behavior. Also investigated was the 
effect of replacement of one long alkyl chain by two 
short ones of the same total length and that of re- 
placement of the benzene ring by a thiophene ring. 
Table I lists the various products which were ex- 
amined. All substances, except for dihexylbenzene 
sulfonate, contained a C12 alkyl chain that was intro- 
duced into the benzene ring by alkylation, using 
concentrated H2S04 as the catalyst (for the thiophene 
derivative, BF3 etherate was the catalyst) and n- 
dodecene-1 as the olefinic base material. Dihexyl- 
benzene was alkylated with n-hexene and A1C13 as 
the catalyst. 
During alkylation, isomerization of the olefinie 
double bond takes place so the resultant product con- 
sists of a mixture of position isomers. The alkyl chain 
can be introduced at any position (ortho, para, or 
recta) with regard to the substituent already present. 
It is known that, under mild conditions, the entering 
group tends to become oriented in the ortho or para 
positions whereas under severe alkylation conditions 
meta-substitution predominates. In this study the 
ratio of ortho, recta, and para-substitution was not 
determined, but it may be assumed that all types 
were present. The alkylate was sulfonated with oleum 
that contained 20% SOy If the position is free, 
mainly para-substitution will occur. Obviously the 
ultimate product is a complicated mixture of position 
isomers. 
Results 
Experimental results (Figure 1 and Table I) were 
evaluated on three points: adaptation time, 1 hard 
residue, and rate of degradation. The products 
showed large differences in adaptation time and hard 
residue; with a few exceptions the differences in 
biodegradation rate were small. 
Adaptation time varied from less than one day 
for lauryl alcohol sulfate to 20 days for dodecyl-m- 
xylene sulfonate. Intermediate values, ranging from 
10 to 14 days, were observed for dodecylethylbenzene 
sulfonate, dodecyl-o-xylene sulfonate, dodecylphenol 
sulfonate, and dihcxylbenzene sulfonate. Lower 
values, between two and ten days, were found for 
dodecylbenzene sulfonate, linear alkylbenzene sul- 
fonate, dodecyl-p-xylene sulfonate, and branched 
alkylbenzene sulfonate. Dodecylthiophene sulfonate 
had an adaptation time of about two days. 
The amounts of hard residue found were between 
zero and 80%. The best products in this respect were 
lauryl alcohol sulfate, dodecytbenzene sulfonate, and 
linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (hard residue zero), 
closely followed by dodeeylthiophene sulfonate. Some- 
what harder (approximately 10% residue) were 
dodecyl-p-xylene sulfonate and dodecylphenol sul- 
fonate. A 40% level was found for dodecyl-o-xylene 
sulfonate, dodccylethylbenzene sulfonate, and heavily 
branched alkylbenzene sulfonate; dihexylbenzene sul- 
fonate and dodecyl-m-xylene sulfonate showed up 
even worse. 
The rate of biodegradation of the branched alkyl- 
benzene sulfonate and dihexylbenzene sulfonate was 
low; the highest rate was found for lauryl alcohol 
sulfate and dodecylthiophene sulfonate. In all other
