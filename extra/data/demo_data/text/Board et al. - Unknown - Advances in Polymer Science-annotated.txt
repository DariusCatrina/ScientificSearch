Preface
The majority of the polymers in use today have been developed within the last 60
years. A large proportion of these are synthetic products, which basically meansthat they are prepared from simple technical monomers. Their principal advantagesare light weight, high impact and tensile strengths, resistance to corrosion, saltwater and most chemicals, as well as suitability for use over a wide range of
temperatures. The various possibilities to ﬁne-tune their properties for plentiful
applications have resulted in continuously growing polymer production of thelast years.
Besides some smaller applications as materials for electronics or automotives,
polymers are mainly used in construction (21%) and as packaging materials (38%).The latter is a comparably short-term application which causes a disposal problemdue to the longevity and undeﬁned environmental fate of the materials. For thisreason, waste management of polymers is of high interest. Waste disposal sites only
shift the problem and cause new environmental concerns [1]. Accordingly, admin-
istrations generate new regulations in order to avoid such environmental pollution.For example, the European Union has restricted the amount of polymeric materialsdesignated to landﬁll. Each member state has to reduce 65% of this volume of wasteby July 2016 and ﬁnd alternative recovery methods [2]. Recycling of polymericproducts, however, is extremely cost-intensive [3] and is hindered by the useof non-mono-material products [4]. Utilization of the high intrinsic fuel valueby waste combustion does not solve the problem due to pollutant emissions and
residues that need to be disposed of as hazardous waste [5]. Therefore, one elegant
way to deal with this problem is the use of biodegradable representatives especiallyin short-term applications such as packaging, foils, and utilities in agriculture.
Biodegradable polymers are macromolecules mainly derived from renewable
sources, which can be enzymatically or hydrolytically degraded into low molecularparts. These parts can be reabsorbed by microorganisms, which ideally convert
them to CO
2and water heading to an environmentally closed circular ﬂow economy
between growing of nutrients, production, utilization, and material recycling
(Fig. 1).
ix
In the recent years, new markets have arisen for biodegradable polymers such
as poly(butylene adipate-terephthalate), poly(lactide), poly(butylenesuccinate), or
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and poly(carbonates). They constitute a new class of“green polymers” with wide application potential for packaging, clothing, carpets,applications in automotive engineering, foils, and utilities in agriculture.
Herein we present the latest results and developments in this ﬁeld. In our
opinion, current trends are promoted by both academic research and industrial
developments. Therefore, we decided to present a combination of both perspectives
within this volume.

We are glad to have Prof. Darensbourg summarizing new efforts of the copoly-
merization of epoxides with carbon dioxide. Prof. Luinstra, formerly BASF SE,
gives additional information about properties and potential application of the
resulting copolymers. Prof. Rieger presents latest advances of catalytic pathways
towards poly(hydroxybutyrate), giving an overview on three possibilities to design
materials with deﬁned properties. Closely related are two articles of Prof. Lecomteand Prof. Lin about recent developments in the ring-opening polymerization offurther lactones and lactides or glycolides, respectively.
Chemical Industries are represented by BASF SE, Showa Denko, WACKER and
DOW Chemicals, who are best qualiﬁed to present challenges and requirements ofbiodegradable polymers on an industrial scale. Information on mineral oil-based
polyesters, poly(vinylalcohol), poly(butylenesuccinate), and new developments in
the ﬁeld of poly(urethanes) from renewable sources can be found within thisvolume.

Salen Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the
Synthesis of Polycarbonates from Cyclic Ethersand Carbon Dioxide
Donald J. Darensbourg
Abstract This chapter focuses on well-deﬁned metal complexes that serve as
homogeneous catalysts for the producti on of polycarbonates from epoxides or
oxetanes and carbon dioxide. Emphasis is placed on the use of salen metalcomplexes, mainly derived from the transition metals chromium and cobalt, inthe presence of onium salts as catalys ts for the coupling of carbon dioxide with
these cyclic ethers. Special considerations are given to the mechanistic pathwaysinvolved in these processes for the pr oduction of these important polymeric
materials.

1 Introduction
Carbon dioxide is a widely available, inexpensive, and renewable resource. Hence,
its utilization as a source of chemical carbon or as a solvent in chemical synthesiscan lead to less of an impact on the environment than alternative processes. The
preparation of aliphatic polycarbonates via the coupling of epoxides or oxetanes
with CO
2illustrates processes where carbon dioxide can serve in both capacities,
i.e., as a monomer and as a solvent. The reactions represented in (1) and (2) are twoof the most well-studied instances of using carbon dioxide in chemical synthesis ofpolymeric materials, and represent environmentally benign routes to these biode-gradable polymers. We and others have comprehensively reviewed this importantarea of chemistry fairly recently. Nevertheless, because of the intense interest andactivity in this discipline, regular updates are warranted.

Prior to examining recent ﬁndings with regard to catalyst design and activity, with
special focus on the mechanistic information gleamed from these results, it is worthreviewing some of the fundamental aspects of this copolymerization process.
Although the ﬁrst report of the coupling of ethylene oxide and carbon dioxide to
produce a polycarbonate with numerous ether linkages is contained in a patent byStevens in 1966 [ 1], it was not until the publication by Inoue and coworkers in 1969
that the process was shown to be a viable route to polycarbonates with a high CO
2
content [ 2,3]. These researchers described the ﬁrst metal-catalyzed copolymerization
of epoxides and carbon dioxide utilizing a heterogeneous catalyst derived from a 1:1mixture of diethylzinc and H
2O. Subsequent studies by Kuran and coworkers
employed closely related zinc complexes, which exhibited a slight improvement
over Inoue’s system [ 4]. Soga and coworkers later reported zinc compounds based
on dicarboxylate ligands, which served as copolymerization catalysts for epoxidesand CO
2and which displayed signiﬁcantly enhanced performances over the earlier
heterogeneous zinc catalyst [ 5]. Nevertheless, these heterogeneous catalyst systems
required very high catalyst loadings and generally provided copolymers with broadmolecular weight distributions.2 D.J. Darensbourg
The scope of this chapter will be to focus on well-deﬁned metal complexes
that serve as homogeneous catalysts for the production of polycarbonates fromepoxides and carbon dioxide. Although there are numerous such well-characterized
metal complexes that catalyze this transformation, we will focus this chapter on
recent contributions involving metal salicylaldimine (salen) and derivatives thereof[6,7]. Some of the alternative catalysts systems are very active and selective for
copolymer production. Most notably among these are the zinc b-diiminates
reported by Coates and coworkers [ 8,9]. These systems have been reviewed in
detail elsewhere [ 10].
2 Background Principles
The coupling of epoxides and carbon dioxide as catalyzed by metal complexes is
generally believed to occur via a coordination-insertion mechanism involvingeither one or two metal centers. The array of reaction processes that are frequentlyassociated with this transformation are indicated below (Schemes 1–4).
2.1 Initiation and Propagation Steps

2.2 Ring-Opening Processes
As indicated in Scheme 2, when R 16¼R2the epoxide ring-opening can occur at
either (regioselective) or both (regioirregular) C–O bonds. In general, for R 1¼H
and R 2¼alkyl group (e.g., propylene oxide) ring opening is favored at the least-
hindered C–O bond. The ring-opening step can take place by intra- or intermolecu-
lar attack by the nucleophile X. The13C NMR spectra in the carbonate region for
regioselective and regioirregular copolymers are illustrated in Fig. 1.X

2.3 Polymer Chain Growth Versus Cyclic Carbonate Production
During polymer chain growth, a back-biting process can lead to cyclic carbonate
formation. In general, this process is more facile for aliphatic epoxides than foralicyclic epoxides and when the growing polymer chain dissociates from the metalcenter (Scheme 3).
2.4 Formation of Ether Linkages
Consecutive CO 2insertion has not been observed (and is assumed to be thermody-
namically unfavored). However, consecutive epoxide ring opening is common,
particularly for Lewis acidic catalysts like zinc derivatives (Scheme 4).
2.5 Stereoselective Reactions
Although uncommon, a chain-end control mechanism has been demonstrated
to be operative for the formation of syndio-enriched poly(propylene carbonate)O

(cyclohexene carbonate) has been achieved from the copolymerization of cyclo-

However, there are numerous reported instances of stereocontrol by a site-control
mechanism involving chiral metal catalysts. That is, Nozaki and coworkers ﬁrstillustrated the asymmetric alternating copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide andCO
2employing a chiral zinc catalyst derived from an amino alcohol (Fig. 2a)
[13–16]. This was soon followed by studies of Coates and coworkers utilizing
an imine-oxazoline zinc catalyst (Fig. 2b)[17]. Both investigations provided
isotactic poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (Fig. 3) with enantiomeric excess of approx-
imately 70%.
Based on the landmark studies of Jacobsen and coworkers, who employed chiral
(salen)CoX complexes for the asymmetric ring opening and kinetic resolution ofaliphatic epoxides [ 18–20], Lu and coworkers synthesized highly isotactic copoly-
mer from rac-propylene oxide and carbon dioxide (Scheme 5)[21].

From the13C NMR spectrum of copolymers produced from cyclohexene oxide
and carbon dioxide it is difﬁcult to assess low levels of asymmetric induction, i.e.,low degrees of desymmetrization in the epoxide ring-opening step. In orderto determine the extent of asymmetric induction it is necessary to hydrolyze the
copolymer leading to the trans -cyclohexane-1,2,-diol and examine the enantiomeric
excess (4) [ 22]. Figure 4shows the

A very thought-provoking discussion of the possible origin of the asymmetric
induction involving chiral (salen)M catalysts is contained in a recent report by Fujiiand coworkers [ 23]. These researchers clearly establish that the external ligands (L)
of the (salen)MnL
2complexes play a pivotal role in amplifying the chirality in the
trans -cyclohexane-1, 2-diamine backbone in these (salen)metal complexes. This is
achieved by the distorted stepped conformation of the salen ligand (Fig. 5).OO

indicative of narrow molecular-weight distribution. This suggests that the copoly-
merization process proceeds via an immortal polymerization process where chaintransfer is rapid and reversible (5) [ 24,25].

Furthermore, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses generally reveal a
bimodal distribution of molecular weights of the copolymers. Concomitantly,
MALDI-ToF mass spectral measurements exhibit two sets of peaks corresponding
to copolymer end groups of –OH and –X. For example, utilizing a (salen)CrCl/bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride ([PPN]Cl) catalyst for the copolymerizationof cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide, the two copolymers illustrated in Fig. 6
were observed [ 26].
3 Coordination Geometries of Schiff-Base Metal Complexes
Unlike their more rigid tetradentate N 42/C0(i.e., porphyrin or tetramethyltetraa-
zaannulene) metal analogs, (salen)MXL complexes can exist in both trans and
cisoctahedral arrangements depending on the nature of the diimine structure. For
example, Jacobson’s chiral chromium(III) or manganese(III) catalysts with thecyclohexylene diimine backbone have a planar N
2O22/C0geometry, whereas, the
cobalt(III) six-coordinate (salen)Co(2,4-dinitrophenolate) derivative with a propyl-ene diimine backbone has a ciscoordination mode (Fig. 7)[27].
A similar observation is noted for complexes containing partially (salalen) and
completely (salan) saturated nitrogen centers (Fig. 8)[28]. Metal complexes of
these ligands generally exhibit a cis-bconﬁguration and the metal center of these
derivatives is chiral ( DorL) (Fig. 9)[29,30]. Figure 10depicts the structure of a
(salalen)CrCl(H
2O) complex as determined by X-ray analysis.
Of importance, these Schiff base metal complexes that contain ciscoordination
sites allow binding of a substrate (monomer) and the growing polymer chain or cancapture a bidentate substrate (growing carbonate polymer chain). Indeed, the use ofCl O OO

4 Recent Studies of (Salen)MX-Catalyzed Copolymerization
Processes
In general, when copolymerizing aliphatic epoxides (e.g., propylene oxide) and
CO 2, temperatures near ambient are necessary to avoid predominant production of
the corresponding cyclic carbonate. Attendant with this restriction on the reactionconditions is a decrease in the reactivity of catalyst systems for copolymer forma-
tion. As mentioned earlier (see Scheme 3), formation of cyclic carbonates is
enhanced if the growing polymer chain has little interaction with the metal center,that is, when the growing polymer chain is outside the inﬂuence of the metalcatalyst. With this consideration in mind, Nozaki and coworkers have synthesizeda (salen)CoOAc complex containing a piperidinium end-capping arm, as depictedin Scheme 6[31]. Employing this catalyst in the presence of one equivalent of
acetic acid, these researchers were able to control the formation of propylenecarbonate during the copolymerization of propylene oxide and carbon dioxide for
a reaction performed at 60
/C14C. Presumably this was achieved by protonation of the
anionic copolymer chain when it became dissociated from the metal center.
In studies possibly inspired by the results from those of Nozaki, Lee and coworkers
have provided bifunctional cobalt(III)-salen catalysts that are very selective forthe production of copolymer from propylene oxide and CO
2. This was achieved by
attaching quaternary ammonium salts to the salen ligands, which serve to providecationic charge as well as internal anions that serve as initiators (Fig. 11)[32–34].
Employing these catalysts, these researchers were able to produce high molecular
weight copolymers ( M
nup to 300,000) at elevated temperatures, with narrow mole-
cular weight distributions (PDI ¼1.19) and with greater than 97% selectivity for

copolymer production. In addition, this methodology has provided for an excellent
strategy for catalyst removal and recycling (vide infra).
An even more active related catalytic system has recently been reported by Lee’s
group. This (salen)cobalt(III) catalyst containing the salen ligand depicted inFig.12exhibits a highly unusual coordination mode for the normally tetradentate
salen ligand [ 35]. That is, whereas the t-butyl-substituted phenolate analog displays
conventional imine coordination, the salen ligand in Fig. 12is proposed to be boundN N

to the cobalt center via its O-donor groups only. The remaining coordination sites of
cobalt are occupied by 2,4-dinitrophenolate anions. Although there is not a deﬁni-tive X-ray structure to support this rare coordination geometry, solution NMR data,
including
15N data, strongly support this binding description. A puzzling feature of
this catalytic system containing the uncoordinated imines is the extended inductionperiods associated with these copolymerization processes.
Lu and coworkers have synthesized a related bifunctional cobalt(III) salen catalyst
similar to that seen in Fig. 11that contains an attached quaternary ammonium
salt (Fig. 13)[36]. This catalyst was found to be very effective at copolymerizing
propylene oxide and CO
2. For example, in a reaction carried out at 90/C14Ca n d2 . 5M P a
pressure, a high molecular weight poly(propylene carbonate) ( Mn¼59,000
and PDI ¼1.22) was obtained with only 6% propylene carbonate byproduct.
For a polymerization process performed under these reaction conditions for 0.5 h,a TOF (turnover frequency) of 5,160 h
/C01was reported. For comparative purposes,
the best TOF observed for a binary catalyst system of (salen)CoX (where X is2,4-dinitrophenolate) onium salt or base for the copolymerization of propyleneoxide and CO
2at 25/C14C was 400–500 h/C01for a process performed at 1.5 MPa pressure
[21,37]. On the other hand, employing catalysts of the type shown in Fig. 12,T O F s
as high as 13,000 h/C01with>99% selectivity for copolymers with Mn170,000 were
obtained at 75/C14C and 2.0 MPa pressure [ 35]. The cobalt catalyst in Fig. 13has also
been shown to be effective for selective copolymer formation from styrene oxideand carbon dioxide [ 38].
It is noteworthy that TOFs as are customarily reported in the epoxide/CO
2
polymerization literature are highly dependent on the time period in which thereaction was performed. Hence, the highest TOFs are recorded for reactions duringthe initial period of high copolymer production.
These latter cationic tagged salen ligand catalysts have the added advantage of
being easily isolated from the copolymer and recycled. It should be noted that
the conventional method for isolation of puriﬁed copolymer is by the addition ofacidiﬁed methanol (1M HCl in MeOH) to a dichloromethane solution of thepolymer/catalyst mixture. This process results in the precipitation of the copolymer,with the catalyst and other byproducts remaining in solution. In order to obtain

a pure polymeric product this process must be repeated several times. The polymer
is isolated by ﬁltration and dried, and the catalyst is destroyed in the process. Dueto the high cost of cleanup, it is desirable to focus on alternative methods for
copolymer puriﬁcation that do not involve the use of large quantities of extraneous
solvents, as well as provide the added feature of catalyst recyclability. With this inmind, catalysts containing attached quaternary ammonium groups, such as thosedepicted in Figs. 11–13, can be separated from the copolymer and effectively
recycled with little loss in activity.
For example, the (salen)Co(III) catalysts depicted in Figs. 11and12have been
isolated with concomitant puriﬁed copolymer by ﬁltration of the polymerizationsolution through a short pad of silica gel (230–400 mesh) resulting in the metal
catalyst being trapped on the pad and the copolymer solution eluted [ 33]. The
(salen)Co(III) catalyst was recovered from the silica gel pad upon solubilizationwith a methanol solution of NaBF
4. In this manner, the separated catalyst could be
reused without signiﬁcant loss in catalytic activity and the copolymer isolated witha metal residue of only 1–2 ppm.
We have utilized somewhat less-effective optional approaches to copolymer
puriﬁcation with attendant catalyst recovery. One of these methods involved thereplacement of the t-butyl substituents on the 5-position of the phenolate ligands
with poly(isobutylene) (PIB) groups, as illustrated in Fig. 14[39]. Importantly,
this chromium(III) catalyst exhibited nearly identical activity as its 3,5-di- t-butyl
analog for the copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide. The PIBsubstituents on the (salen)CrCl catalysts provide high solubility in heptanes oncethe copolymer is separated from the metal center by a weak acid.
The second procedure we employed involved the use of a switchable polarity
solvent derived from a low-boiling secondary amine and carbon dioxide (6) [ 40].

can be easily recovered from the ﬁltrate by vacuum removal of the amine/CO 2
solvent, which can be recycled. In addition to the reports cited above, there are
numerous other examples of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts designed
for separation of metal salen complexes from product mixtures, including tethering
the complexes to solid supports [ 41].
An alternative pathway that has allowed for the selective formation of copolymer
from propylene oxide and carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures has recently beenreported by Lu and coworkers [ 42]. The complex shown in Fig. 15has a sterically
hindered organic base attached to the salen ligand and was found to be highly activefor copolymerization of propylene oxide and CO
2at temperatures up to 100/C14Ca n d
low CO 2pressures. Importantly, the tethered organic base aids in stabilizing the
(salen)CoIIIcomplex at elevated temperatures. Recall that (salen)CoIIIcatalysts
generally are unstable towards reduction to inactive (salen)CoIIspecies at elevated
temperatures. Copolymer epoxide/CO 2enchainment was proposed to proceed via
alternating dissociation of the activated tethered organic base and the growingpolymer chain on opposite sides of the —Co— catalyst, as illustrated in Scheme 7.
Deﬁnitive infrared evidence was presented for the transformation of the organic baseto the carbonate species derived from a ring-opened epoxide followed by CO

insertion. Furthermore, Lu has hypothesized that an alternating chain growth occurs
from both sides of the cobalt(III) salen center when an unattached stericallyhindered organic base or a quaternary ammonium halide are utilized as co-catalysts
with (salen)CoX catalysts.
Pertinent to this latter issue, we have addressed this point by employing chro-
mium(III) catalysts derived from tetramethyltetraazaannulene (tmtaa). In previousstudies, we have demonstrated the (tmtaa)CrCl complex in the presence of oniumsalts to be more active than their salen analogs but to have common mechanisticfeatures in catalysis of the copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and carbondioxide [ 43,44]. In order to probe whether copolymer chain propagation occurred
from one or both sides of the N
4-ligand plane, we prepared two electronically
very similar (tmtaa)CrCl catalysts [ 45]. One of these chromium(III) complexes
contained a sterically encumbering strap, ( stmtaa)CrCl (see Fig. 16), and another to
mimic the strap complex electronically, ( smtmtaa)CrCl, where the steric restraints
of the strap are relieved by eliminating the four-membered saturated carbon chainof the strap. This electronically similar ligand is depicted in Fig. 17, which clearly
illustrates the accessibility of a bound metal center from either side of the N
4-ligand
plane. Upon monitoring the copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and CO 2by
in situ infrared spectroscopy [ 46] using the two chromium(III) catalysts in the
presence of [PPN]Cl under identical reaction conditions (3.5 MPa and 80/C14C),
indistinguishable activity for copolymer formation was observed. That is, fora reaction performed for 1 h, the TOFs were 807 and 797 h
/C01providing copolymers
with Mnvalues of 11,400 and 12,000 Da and polydispersities of 1.11 and 1.05,
respectively. This result strongly supports the proposal that these and relatedcatalyst systems catalyze the copolymerization of epoxides and CO
2through
a monocatalytic single-site mechanism. It is well-established that in the presenceof onium salts, catalytic systems of this general type proceed via a monometallic
mechanism [ 47].

An alternative monomer that is available for copolymerization reactions with
carbon dioxide to provide value-added polymeric materials is the four-memberedcyclic ether, oxetane(1,3-propylene oxide), equation 2. Since the ring-strain energyof epoxides and oxetanes do not differ substantially, e.g., propylene oxide andoxetane have ring-strain energies of 114.2 and 106.7 kJ/mol, respectively, it wouldbe anticipated that (salen)MX catalysts in the presence of onium salts would be
effective at copolymerizing oxetane or its derivatives with CO
2. Indeed, we have
shown (salen)CrCl in the presence of tetra- n-butylammonium halides to be active at
affording polycarbonates from oxetane, and derivatives thereof, and carbon dioxide[48–50]. The two processes involving three- or four-membered cyclic ethers
have much in common, as well as some notable differences. Most importantly,the thermal stability of the cyclic byproducts of these coupling reactions relative totheir copolymers are strikingly different. That is, whereas ﬁve-membered cycliccarbonates are more stable than their corresponding polycarbonates, six-membered
cyclic carbonates readily provide polycarbonates by a ring-opening polymerization
process without loss of CO
2. Another signiﬁcant difference between epoxides
and oxetanes is their respective binding abilities to metal centers, e.g., the p Kbs
of propylene oxide and oxetane are 6.94 and 3.13, respectively. This high basicityof oxetane, coupled with its less reactivity for ring-opening, is best illustrated in thefact that we have isolated adducts of (salen)CrCloxetane, and characterized theseby X-ray crystallography (Fig. 18). These complexes represent intermediates in
the copolymerization process.
Kinetic measurements of the ring-opening polymerization of trimethylene
carbonate (TMC) versus the enchainment of oxetane and CO
2to provide poly
(TMC) reveal that these processes in the presence of (salen)CrCl and an ammoniumsalt have similar free energies of activation ( DG
{) at 110/C14C. This similarity in
reactivity coupled with the observation that in situ infrared studies of the copoly-merization of oxetane and CO
2showed the presence of TMC during the early stages
of the reaction has led to the overall mechanism for copolymer production shown in
Fig. 17 X-ray structure of the protonated version of the ligand smtmtaa, illustrating the ﬂexibility
of the unattached anisoyl arms to expose the underside of the complexSalen Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Synthesis 17
Scheme 8. In addition, end group analyses of the polymer produced from oxetane
and CO 2were consistent with polymer formation proceeding in part through the
intermediary of TMC. This route has some advantages over the direct enchainment of
CO2and oxetane. That is, the ring-opening polymerization of TMC proceeds without
loss of CO 2, hence, leading to no ether linkages in the polymer, whereas the
comonomer enchainment pathway leads to a small percentage ( <8%) of random
ether linkages. Furthermore, when synthesizing diblock copolymers of poly(TMC)and polylactides for production of biodegradable medical devices, it is convenient toutilize a melt polymerization process using the two monomers.

Additional studies have shown that by using (salen)CoIIor (salen)CrCl catalysts
in the presence of good leaving groups like bromide or iodide in place of azide, aswell as lower reaction temperatures, it is possible to tune the coupling of oxetaneand CO
2to copolymer to proceed almost exclusively via the intermediacy of TMC
[51,52]. Figure 19depicts such a reaction where the catalyst (salen)CrCl in
the presence of n-Bu 4NBr led to poly(TMC) primarily through initial formation
of TMC at 70/C14C.
As alluded to earlier, an important adva ncement in catalyst design for the
copolymerization of epoxides and carbon dioxide involves the use of Schiffbase metal complexes where the ligand is in a cisconﬁguration, as depicted in
Fig. 9. For example, Chen and coworkers ha ve recently reported a (salen)Co
Fig. 19 Polymerization reaction of oxetane and CO 2catalyzed by (salen)CrCl and two
equivalents of n-Bu 4NBr at 70/C14C (salen ligand contains a cyclohexylene backbone for the diimine
and t-butyl substituents in the 3,5-positions of the phenolates). ( a)Three-dimensional infrared

(2,4-dinitrophenolate) complex possessing a cisconﬁguration to be quite active,
and very selective at 60/C14C for the production of polycarbonate from propylene
oxide and CO 2[53]. DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridine) was found to be a more
effective co-catalyst than n-Bu 4NBr or [PPN]Cl, whereas generally the reverse
situation is true. The salen ligand in this cobalt(III) derivative containsa 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propylene diimino backbone, which affords a more ﬂexibleligand. This represents a class of novel salen metal complexes like the typeillustrated in Fig. 7where n¼1. In turn, the 2,4-dinitrophenolate anion binds in
a chelating fashion to the cobalt center via a phenolate oxygen and one oxygen of itsnitro-substituent. This structure was fully characterized by X-ray crystallographyand represents a new class of cobalt(III) complexes for catalyzing the alternating
copolymerization of CO
2and epoxides. Furthermore, because of the cisarrange-
ment of the substrate and the growing polymer chain, new mechanistic aspects forthese catalytic systems will probably be uncovered.
Indeed this has become apparent in studies involving the copolymerization of
cyclohexene oxide and CO
2catalyzed by (salalen)CrCl in the presence of onium
salts recently reported by Nozaki and coworkers [ 26]. The structure of the (salalen)
CrCl catalyst employed in this investigation has been deﬁned by X-ray crystallog-raphy by Katsuki and coworkers [ 28] (shown in Fig. 10), where the salalen ligand
adopts a cis-bstructure as indicated in Fig. 9. The chromium(III) complexes in the
presence of [PPN]Cl were notably very active for the copolymerization ofcyclohexene oxide and CO
2to provide almost perfectly alternating copolymers at
atmospheric pressure of carbon dioxide. TOF values of about 100 h/C01were
observed at 70/C14C for a reaction carried out over 2–5 h. The very high catalytic
activity at low CO 2pressure was proposed to be due to a low barrier for CO 2
insertion, coupled with an inhibition to deinsertion as a result of the growingpolymer chain chelating to the metal center, as shown in Fig. 20.
In related investigations, chiral chromium(III) complexes of tetradentate
N,N
0-disubstituted bis(aminophenoxides) or fully saturated salen ligands (Fig. 8),
(salan)CrCl, have been shown to have a higher catalytic activity for the copoly-merization of propylene oxide and CO
2than their (salen)CrCl analogs [ 54]. This
increase in activity was proposed to be due to the higher electron donatingability of the salan ligands relative to salen ligands. An additional considerationthat must be taken into account is the difference in coordination geometry ofthe two metal complexes. Indeed, this di fference in coordination chemistry of

salen- and salan-Cr(III) species with respect to their interaction with DMAP was
dramatically evident as revealed in electrospray ionization mass spectrometrystudies (ESI-MS) [ 55]. In these studies, the (salen)Cr
+cations were shown to
preferentially bind two DMAP molecules to afford six-coordination complexes,
whereas (salan)Cr+cations were found to bind only one. This difference in
binding ability exhibited itself in the relative catalytic ability of the complexesin the presence of DMAP for the copolymerization of propylene oxide and CO
2
at ambient temperature. That is, (salan)CrX (X ¼Cl or NO 3) derivatives were
about 30 times more active than their (salen)CrX analogs. Furthermore, the(salen)CrX derivatives displayed a long induction period in the presence ofDMAP, and the (salan)CrX complexes did not.
We observed similar differences in the binding abilities of (salen)CrCl and
(salan)CrCl complexes towards azide ions [ 30]. For example, whereas (salen)
CrCl readily reacts with two equivalents of azide to provide (salen)Cr(N
3)2/C0
derivatives, which have been crystallographically characterized [ 50,56], (salan)
CrCl reacts with only one equivalent of azide to afford (salan)CrN 3. In addition,
(salan)CrCl in the presence of two equivalents of [PPN]N 3resulted in a short
induction period (~0.5 h) for the copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide andCO
2. Although (salan)CrCl and [PPN]N 3were effective at copolymerizing propyl-
ene oxide and CO 2at ambient temperature, higher temperatures (~60/C14C) were
required when copolymerizing cyclohexene oxide and CO 2. The most striking
result we noted was that the terpolymerization of propylene oxide/cyclohexeneoxide/CO
2occurred easily at ambient temperature with little selectivity for propyl-
ene oxide. A similar observation was recently noted by Lu and coworkers [ 42].
Early on we and others using zinc and rare earth metal complexes demonstrated
that it was possible to perform terpolymerization reactions with aliphatic epoxides,cyclohexene oxide, and carbon dioxide with only small quantities of cyclic carbon-
ate formation [ 57–59]. The problems we faced were that it was difﬁcult to control
the composition and alternating nature of the epoxides in the resulting terpolymers.For example, when we carried out a reaction between equal molar cyclohexeneoxide and propylene oxide with CO
2at 55/C14C in the presence of a bis(2,6-diﬂuoro-
phenoxide)zinc dimer catalyst, the formed terpolymer possessed 85% cyclohexenecarbonate linkages [ 60]. More recently, there has been signiﬁcant progress in
synthesizing terpolymers of aliphatic epoxides, cyclohexene oxide, and carbondioxide employing (salen)MX and (salan)MX [M ¼Co(III) or Cr(III)] complexes
as catalysts. These studies are of importance because it would be desirable to both
lower the glass transition temperature ( T
g) of the propylene oxide/CO 2copolymer
(~40/C14C) for applications as soft ﬁlms and to raise it for applications as structural
materials.
Because of the enhanced effectiveness of the cobalt(III) complex with
piperidinium end-capping arms (Scheme 6) compared to standard (salen)CoX
catalysts for the copolymerization of propylene oxide and CO 2,N o z a k ia n d
coworkers were able to prepare in a stepwise manner a tapered block terpolymer
by ﬁrst copolymerizing propylene oxide/CO 2followed by 1-hexene oxide/CO 2[31].Salen Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Synthesis 21
Real progress in providing terpolymers from aliphatic epoxides, cyclohexene
oxide, and carbon dioxide in controlled processes has recently been achieved. Aspreviously mentioned, (salan)CrCl in the presence of one equivalent of [PPN]N
3
was found to catalyze the terpolymerization of cyclohexene oxide, propylene oxide,and CO
2at ambient temperature, even though the copolymerization of cyclohexene
oxide and CO 2alone required more elevated temperatures [ 30,42]. This rate
enhancement for incorporation of cyclohexene oxide into the polycarbonate inthe presence of propylene oxide has been ascribed to a preferential binding ofcyclohexene oxide to the metal center, coupled with a faster rate for ring opening ofcyclohexene oxide by a propylene carbonate polymer chain end group (vide infra).The results of this kinetic behavior is to lead to a terpolymer where the propylene
carbonate–cyclohexene carbonate linkages are much higher than the propylene
carbonate–propylene carbonate or cyclohexene carbonate–cyclohexene carbonatelinkages [ 36]. Using the cobalt(III) complex shown in Fig. 13, Lu and coworkers
were able to synthesize terpolymers from cyclohexene oxide, propylene oxide, andCO
2covering a range of Tgs from 42 to 118/C14C (See Fig. 21).
Lee and coworkers have reported on the use of the highly active and selective
cobalt(III) catalyst depicted in Fig. 12for the terpolymerization of propylene oxide
and various epoxides with CO 2, including cyclohexene oxide, 1-hexene oxide, and
1-butene oxide [ 61]. Catalytic activities ranged from 4,400–14,000 h/C01at a CO 2

cyclohexene oxide, propylene oxide, and CO 2[36]22 D.J. Darensbourg
pressure of 2 MPa and temperatures of 70–75/C14C with a greater than 99% selectivity
for terpolymer production. A linear dependence of the polymer Tgon the mole
fraction of the third monomer (i.e., cyclohexene oxide, 1-hexene oxide, or 1-buteneoxide) was observed. The T
granges were 52–115/C14C,/C015–32/C14C, and 9–33/C14C,
respectively. The decomposition temperature of the terpolymers increased withincreasing concentrations of the third monomer. Importantly, in all three
terpolymerization systems, the mole fractions of propylene oxide in the feed and
in the polymers ﬁt the Fineman–Ross plot. That is, plots of (F/f)(f /C01) versus F
2/f
were linear at low conversion, where F and f are the ratios of monomers in the feedand polymer, respectively [ 62]. This analysis allows for a determination of the
monomer reactivity ratios given by r
1¼k11/k12and r2¼k22/k21. For example,
Scheme 9deﬁnes the rate constants for the terpolymerization of CO 2/propylene
oxide/cyclohexene oxide, where r1¼rPO¼1.7 and r2¼rCHO¼0.37. Hence,
rPO/C2rCHO equals 0.63 or less than one, which corresponds to a process where
k11/k12equals k21/k22. This is consistent with the observed lower catalytic activity
noted with increasing cyclohexene oxide in the monomer feed. It is noteworthythat this kinetic analysis assumes that propylene oxide and cyclohexene oxidehave equal propensities for binding to the cobalt(III) center. Although quantitativebinding data of cyclohexene oxide and propylene oxide with cobalt(III) is notavailable, we have previously reported identical thermodynamic data for theseepoxides binding to Cd(II) in [ tris(3-Ph-pyrazolyl)hydroborate]Cd acetate
[63,64]. The Cd–O bond distances obtained by X-ray crystallography in the
isolated epoxide adducts were also found to be quite similar [ 65].
Other recent reports of interesting ter polymerization processes involving
cyclohexene oxide and diglycolic anhydride or vinylcyclohexene oxide haveappeared in the literature [ 66–68]. These processes are indicated in (7) and (8),
and were carried out in the presence of b-diiminate zinc catalysts. The vinyl
functionalized polymer was intramolecula rly crosslinked by a metathesis reaction
to afford nanoparticles.

Finally, the replacement of oxygen atoms in polycarbonates by another member
of the chalcogen family, sulfur, can lead to copolymers with desirable propertiessuch as greater thermal stability, optical properties, and potential use as heavy metal
scavengers. Although poly(trithiocarbonates) are usually synthesized by the ring-
opening polymerization of cyclic carbonates, Nozaki and coworkers have shownthat (salen)CrCl in the presence of [PPN]Cl is effective at producing copolymerfrom propylene sulﬁde and CS
2(9) [69]. Depending on the relative monomer feed
ratio and the reaction conditions, the selectivity for copolymer versustrithiocarbonate varied between 37 and 92%.

5 Summary
Over the past decade, during which (salen)metal(III) catalysts have been utilized
for the effective copolymerization of both aliphatic and alicyclic epoxides,many advancements in these processes have been forthcoming. These includecatalyst design and recovery, product selectivity, regio-and stereoregularitiesof the resulting copolymers, and control of terpolymer composition. Recently,these studies have extended into the synthesis of copolymers from oxetanes andcarbon dioxide, and epoxides or episulﬁdes and carbon disulﬁde. It is anticipated
that interest in these and related studies will intensify in the future with an emphasis
on the synthesis of co- and terpolymers from carbon dioxide and a more diversegroup of comonomers. The studies reported upon herein should provide the stimulusfor further developments in the important area of producing useful biodegradablepolymeric materials via greener processes.

Material Properties of Poly(Propylene
Carbonates)
Gerrit. A. Luinstra and Endres Borchardt
Abstract The material properties of poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) are discussed
with respect to thermal features, viscoelastic and mechanical properties, process-
ability, characteristics in solution, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. Thermal
decomposition proceeds in two steps: (1) backbiting at temperatures as low as150
/C14C in the presence of catalyst residues, giving cyclic propylene carbonate; and
(2) chain scission at temperatures over 200/C14C with possible involvement of initial
hydrolysis. PPC shows one thermal transition at a glass temperature of around40
/C14C. PPC is a pseudoplastic material, and a master curve constructed for fre-
quency-dependent viscosity shows no real plateau for material of number-averagemolecular weight (Mn) <50 kDa. At temperatures in the range of the glass tran-
sition, the apparent activation energy for ﬂow changes rapidly from 500 kJ/mol to
about 40 kJ/mol. The viscosity of PPC has an activation energy in the range of5–25 kJ/mol (Mn <50 kDa). The modulus of elasticity (around 800 MPa) and
yield strength (10–20 MPa) are reminiscent of low-density polyethylene. PPC has alarge elongation at break, and may be useful for the preparation of composites andblends. Biodegradation of PPC is dominated by hydrolysis, which can be acceler-ated by Lewis acid catalyst residues. Biocompatibility is excellent in the sense thatit does not induce an inﬂammatory reaction in tissue.

1 Introduction
Poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) as the product of the “alternating” copolymeriza-
tion of carbon dioxide and propylene oxide (PO) was ﬁrst synthesized at the end ofthe 1960s with a rudimentary catalyst based on water and diethyl zinc [ 1]. The
alternation of a carbon dioxide and PO moiety in the backbone was and is notalways perfect: consecutive PO units led to ether linkages in the polycarbonate.In the course of time, better catalysts were found and known catalysts were
optimized. Only very recently with the application of homogeneous catalysts, has
the perfect alternating polymer routinely become accessible [ 2–5]. The label “PPC”
is used for many types of products that result from the copolymerization of PO andcarbon dioxide. The composition, regio- and stereochemistry of the products,however, may vary in a certain range, and so may the resulting material properties.In many publications dealing with the material PPC, detailed information on themicrostructure is lacking, making it generally difﬁcult to compare individualstudies and to arrive at “PPC properties.” In this review, we will consider only
PPC with less than 10% ether linkages in the backbone, and we will only differen-
tiate between PPC and alt-PPC, the latter referring to the perfectly alternating
polymer (Fig. 1).
The commercialization of the product has recently reached volumes of over
1,000 t/year [ 6]. For example, a PPC line of 10,000 t/year was commissioned by
the China Bluechemical Ltd [ 7].
1In the past, PPC was mainly used in binder
applications at a volume smaller than 100 t/year [ 8]. The main reason for the current
increase in production and capacities is the relatively smooth biological degradation,
which has become of importance lately with respect to a general recognition of the
need to prevent persistent pollution by plas tic materials. An earlier commercialization
was probably impeded greatly by the “challenging” material properties, i.e., PPC didnot ﬁt into any large existing market. Other economic constraints were tentatively
1Other producers are the Inner Mongolia Meng Xi High-Tech Group, whose production of PPC in
China apparently has a capacity of up to 9 kt [ www.degradable.org.cn ] and the Tianguan
Enterprise Group (Henan, PRC).30 G.A. Luinstra and E. Borchardt
less decisive: raw materials are readily accessible and abundant, technology could
have been developed or adapted, and an acceptable catalyst was already available inthe 1980s [ 9]. At the appropriate volume and technology, the costs of production
could thus have been in the range of poly(propylene oxide) production.
The challenges involved in the material properties of PPC relate to its thermal
features, i.e., its thermal decomposition, and the glass transition temperature ( T
g)o f
about body temperature of the otherwise amorphous polymer. These have implica-tions for processing and application of the material. This review will discussconsecutively the thermal, viscoelastic, and mechanical properties of PPC and theexperiences in processing PPC and its composites. The properties of solutions ofPPC will also be presented, and the biodegradability and biocompatibility dis-
cussed. Spectroscopic properties will not be discussed. Further information on
NMR data can be found in the following references [ 2,10–12]. A typical spectrum
is shown in Fig. 2[13].
2 Thermal Properties
2.1 Thermal Decomposition and Stabilization of PPC
The thermal decomposition of PPC has been studied in the past using several
methods, including the time-dependent viscosity of hot PPC, thermogravi-metric analysis (TGA), and pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometryOC O+O

(GC/MS) [ 10]. The conclusion of all these older and some new studies is that the
main low energy thermal decomposition pathway of PPC prepared from heteroge-neous zinc catalysts commencing at temperatures of about 150–180
/C14C is backbiting
or unzipping [ 14,15]. The main product is cyclic propylene carbonate (cPC), which
has an atmospheric boiling point of 240/C14C[16].2The formation of cyclic carbonate
could unequivocally be secured [ 15]. Propylene carbonate is very compatible with
PPC, and is only slowly released from it (vide infra). It should be noted thereforethat TGA assessments of decomposition temperatures are not very sensitive below200
/C14C for indicating decomposition or molecular weight breakdown. In fact, loss of
mass at temperatures around 240/C14C and higher may represent the physical desorp-
tion of cPC from the already decomposed sample. Thus, the literature data on
thermal decomposition of PPCs may appear confusing, e.g., one of the highest
decomposition temperatures for a PPC reported is 278/C14C, measured for a sample
with a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 50 kDa and about 92% ofcarbonate linkages. The decomposition point was taken as the onset of thermaldecomposition, with 5% loss of mass [ 17]).
The thermal decomposition behavior has been newly addressed in the last
5 years. The understanding has been deepened with the objective to thermallystabilize PPC. The onset of decomposition in the range of 150–180
/C14C is unfavor-
able for processing because ultrahigh molecular weight PPC is still quite viscous at
that temperature and there could be substantial stress in the sample after injectionmolding at low processing temperature. This stress will relax at room temperatureand deform the sample. A thermally more resilient PPC is thus highly desirable.
The mechanism of thermal decomposition at temperatures up to about 180
/C14C
is unzipping for a normally pure sample of PPC. Chain ends play a role in thedecomposition process, as deduced from the stabilizing effect achieved by end-capping [ 10,18]. It was thus established that the decomposition temperature of
capped PPC is independent of the molecular weight, whereas the opposite is true for
uncapped PPC [ 19,20]. Lower molecular weight PPC loses mass faster because of
the higher concentration of end groups [ 21]. In contrast to the generally observed
backbiting reactions below 200
/C14C, much more robust PPCs are occasionally
reported. In an older publication on a PPC that was prepared from zinc glutaratecontaining a perﬂuorinated diacid, the onset of thermal decomposition wasalso found to be dependent on the molecular weight and ranged from 233 to255
/C14C for samples having a Mn of 59 and 144 kDa, respectively [ 22]. The NMR
spectra showed broad lines prohibiting an accurate assessment of the percentage of
carbonate linkages.
More insights are given in a publication by Varghese et al. in 2010 [ 23]. An alt-
PPC sample prepared with a homogeneous cobalt catalyst shows that Lewis acidsand water may generate hydroxide or carbonate chain ends with subsequent fastunzipping at temperatures as low as 150
/C14C[23]. This behavior was observed for a
product with catalyst residues and with thermally unstable linkages in the main
2Seehttp://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propylene_carbonate . Accessed 01 April 2011.32 G.A. Luinstra and E. Borchardt
chain (peroxide). Hydrolysis and subsequent backbiting led to cPC. Lewis acids and
water may generate hydroxide or carbonate chain ends with subsequent fast unzip-ping at temperatures as low as 150
/C14C. However, a pure sample of alt-PPC with a
molecular weight (Mw) of 330 kDa prepared from a peroxide-free catalyst was
found to decompose only slowly, even at 200/C14C, with no formation of cPC. This is
both remarkable and highly desirable. These observations should be veriﬁed withsamples of PPC from other sources and with other molecular weights. Consistentwith these results is a report on the stability of a commercial product from theTianguan Enterprise Group, which was reported in 2010 [ 24]. Here, an onset of
thermal decomposition was found at 260
/C14C.
At temperatures higher than 200/C14C, chain scission sets in [ 16,19,23]. An older
study of PPC of various molecular weights used the more sophisticated approach of
TGA coupled to IR spectroscopy, and pyrolysis GC/MS [ 14]. A peak rate of decom-
position (dependent on the molecular weight) was found at about 230–250/C14C. At
such temperatures, end-capped PPC also thermally decomposes [ 19]. It is suggested
that, at this temperature, main chain scission is in full progress and results in fastand irreversible decomposition. From these studies, it is obvious that PPC isexceedingly unstable at temperatures over 240
/C14C. The products of decomposition
are not univocally established. Cyclic carbonate and propylene glycol might also be
products [ 14,23], but they were not found by Lee and coworkers [ 23]. Lewis acids
impact the unzipping reaction to some extent [ 25]. The formation of propylene
glycol could reﬂect the presence of hydrolysis in the high temperature decomposi-tion pathway.
The kinetics of the decomposition of PPC has been estimated from several
studies. An analysis from TGA shows that the activation energy for end-cappedPPC at temperatures over approximately 250
/C14C is in the range of 130 kJ/mol,
a relatively low value (for a chain scission process) [ 19]. The same analysis for
uncapped PPC is complicated by non-linear behavior. Results consistently indicate
that, at lower temperatures, a different decomposition reaction takes place than athigher temperatures.
In Fig. 3, the thermal decomposition of PPC is depicted according to the current
state of knowledge. At lower temperatures and with samples that have not beenprepared and puriﬁed with the utmost care, unzipping readily proceeds, even at

150/C14C. At higher temperatures main-chain scission occurs, but the pathways still
needs to be clariﬁed. Cyclic carbonate may also be formed (e.g., after hydrolysiswith residual water), but not necessarily. CO
2and propylene glycol may result as
products. Thermally more stable PPC may be processed at temperatures over 250/C14C
as long as exposure time is short (minutes).
In order to thermally stabilize PPC, several approaches have been followed that
are similar to the approaches used for generating a commercially useful polyacetal,which also readily decomposes by unzipping [ 26]. Two strategies are recognizable:
effective end-capping to prevent unzipping (analogous to, e.g., Delrin productionby Dupont) and incorporation of co-monomers (such as Ultraform BASF SE). Thelatter will also certainly affect other properties ( T
g). End-capping in solution can be
achieved with electrophilic reagents such as acetyl chloride, chlorophosphates,
methane sulfonyl chloride [ 27], anhydrides [ 19] or chlorosilanes [ 28]. In addition,
several reports document how the addition of anhydrides (maleic, succinic) canstabilize the high temperature melt of PPC [ 29,30].
The thermal degradation of maleic anhydride end-capped PPC (MA
end/C0PPC)
occurs at a temperature that is about 20 K higher than that of PPC degradation (fromTGA for 5% loss of mass) [ 18]. In that study, viscosity change with time was also
used to monitor the chain degradation [ 18]. The time dependence of the complex
viscosity at 180
/C14C shows how the decomposition rate of PPC and MA end–PPC
differ by a factor of 35. The rate of decomposition of PPC is found to acceleratewith decomposition. This is attributed to an autocatalytic process involving the newspecies (presumably end groups or water formation, cf. Fig. 3). The decomposition
rate of MA
end–PPC is linear with time in the smaller range of degradation studied.
This does not imply that a nonlinear behavior will not also set in at a higher state ofdecomposition.
Thermal stabilization could also be attained by adding certain stabilizers to PPC,
e.g.,b-cyclodextrin. The principal effect could also be interpreted as the controlling
of end-group reactivity. Due to the binding of the chain ends in the cavity, unzip-ping is thought to be retarded, with an apparent increase of about 30
/C14C in thermo-
stability [ 31]. A 10/C14C increase in thermal stability of PPC was found in a composite
with MgAl layered double hydroxide [ 32]. An older study reports on a similar
improvement of the thermal stability of PPC resulting from the use of a supportedzinc glutarate catalyst on montmorillonite for PPC synthesis in neat PO. Thepolymer with a Mn of 20 kDa had a thermal decomposition onset of over 256
/C14C.
The origin was attributed to clay residues [ 33]. Surprisingly, cyclic amines addi-
tives can also be useful for thermally stabilizing PPC [ 34]. The origin of this effect
has not yet been studied. In addition, calcium stearate, which was shown to complexto PPC, improves thermal stability at processing conditions [ 35]. It is corroborated
that chain mobility is decreased by the metal salt.
The overall thermal stability of PPC can further be enhanced through modiﬁca-
tion of the main chain, i.e., by the incorporation of ether units, or through theterpolymerization with epoxides other than PO or ethylene oxide (EO), and with
lactide, lactones and other heterocycles [ 36–39]. The higher the content of ether
linkages in PPC, the higher the thermal stability is [ 40]. This seems to be a result of34 G.A. Luinstra and E. Borchardt
several effects: the concentration of carbonate linkages decreases, backbiting with
formation of cPC is interrupted, and the chain is tentatively less mobile. The latterpoint is implied from a study involving several aliphatic polycarbonates derived
from linear monoalkyl epoxides. The study shows that the thermal instability of
ethylene and propylene polycarbonate is poor in relation to other epoxide/CO
2
copolymers [ 41]. The terpolymerization of PO/CO 2and cyclohexene oxide (CHO)
with a salen cobalt (III) type of catalyst was reported to yield a statistical copolymerwith C
3and cyclic C 6two-carbon building blocks between carbonate linkages. The
thermal decomposition temperature (50 wt% of the sample) thus increased with theamount of CHO from 257
/C14C for PPC to 295/C14C[42]. This is analogous to similar
work with other catalysts to synthesize terpolycarbonates of PO and CHO or
derivatives [ 41,43–49]. A new report on the terpolymer of PPC with cyclohexene
oxide show a higher decomposition temperature in TGA, with a 5% mass loss at244
/C14C with 6.7 mol% of CHO [ 50]. Ether linkages in the terpolymers were not
speciﬁed.
A terpolymer of PPC with [(2-naphthyloxy)methyl]oxirane as further monomer
could also be obtained [ 51]. Here, a systematic increase in the onset of decomposi-
tion temperature with termonomer incorporation was measured, despite the factthat the terpolymer had a smaller molar mass with increasing termonomer content
(the higher ether content was not considered). The effect is attributed to a stiffer
main chain that is less mobile and thus has higher energy vibrational modes. In afurther study using this strategy, a terpolymer with N-(2,3-epoxylpropyl)carbazole
shows an onset of decomposition at 265
/C14C (by TGA) [ 52]. Yet another series of
terpolycarbonates was prepared consisting of PO/CO 2and a bifunctional glycidyl
ether-type of monomer using a heterogeneous catalyst system based on diethyl zinc,glycerine, and yttrium carboxylate [ 53]. Several products were obtained with
molecular weights ranging from 109 to 200 kDa. A 37
/C14C increase in decomposition
temperature onset (the lowest was about 190/C14C) was found between the two molecular
weights. Here, a decrease in mobility through network formation is anticipated.
Terpolymers of maleic anhydride (MA) and PPC could be prepared using a
double-metal cyanide (DMC)-type catalyst. The polymer was amorphous like mostterpolymers of propylene carbonate [ 39]. For terpolymers with up to 50:50 (mol/
mol) of PO/CO
2and MA, it could be shown by TGA that the observed degradation
temperature was again raised by about 20–30/C14C and that the maximum rate of
decomposition even exceeded 300/C14C.
For recently prepared terpolymers of PO/CO 2noticeable improvements in
thermal stability were thus achieved. The rate of decomposition decreases withthe termonomer content. Part of the effect obv iously originates from the lower concen-
tration of propylene carbonate entities and another part from the lower ﬂexibility ofthe main chain. In addition, another explanation for the increase in thermal stabilitywith termonomers (which is, however, not substantiated) could be found in thesolubility of water in the product because every recent study indicates that hydrolysisis a major cause of the initiation of thermal decomposition [ 23]. Also, additives
have been identiﬁed as slowing down thermal degradation.Material Properties of Poly(Propylene Carbonates) 35
2.2 Thermal Transitions
Several reports concern the thermal transitions of PPC. Glass temperatures for
“PPC” have been determined that range from just above 25/C14C to about 45/C14C. The
broad range indicates that the PPC products are only similar, not identical. Themicrostructure (regioregularity) is a factor. To illustrate this point, it is useful tolook at PPC from a catalyst system based on diethyl zinc, glycerine, and yttriumcarboxylate. It produces polycarbonate with various regioregularities as a functionof the yttrium content. It is reported that the higher the concentration of head-to-tail
linkages, the higher the T
g. A range was found of 37–42/C14C for polymers with
70–77% head-to-tail dyads, respectively [ 54]. An alt-PPC with more than 95%
head-to-tail dyads and a Mn of 55 kDa had a Tgof 40/C14C[5,10].
A further factor is the amount of ether linkages in the polycarbonate. For
example, a polymer-supported DMC catalyst based on zinc and ferricyanatesallowed the preparation of a polymer containing a substantial amount (40–60%)of ether linkages. This product had a T
gof 8/C14C[37]. This compares well with an
ether carbonate polymer from a DMC catalyst mentioned in an older patent from
the Dow chemical company with a 17% ether linkage of low molecular weight [ 55].
Assuming that the Tgof the polyether carbonate follows the Fox equation, i.e.,
Tg¼1/(w1/Tg1þw2/Tg2þ...) where wiis the weight percentage of co-monomer
i, and Tgiis the glass temperature in K of co-monomer i. Setting the glass tempera-
ture of the poly(propylene oxide) copolymer part to /C065/C14C[56], aTgof 38–42/C14C
must be concluded for the polyether carbonate.
The molecular weight is obviously a determining factor [ 15,17,22]. The
maximum of tan din dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) analyses as
a measure for Tgwas determined for PPC with various molecular weights to be
30–36/C14C for Mn of 29–141 kDa [ 21]. The corresponding data from modulated
differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) are reported as 24–37/C14C (the PPCs were
prepared with zinc glutarate as catalyst, and should have about 5% of etherlinkages). In contrast to this, a T
gof 28/C14C was found for a PPC prepared from
zinc adipate [ 57,58]. Analyzing these data according to the Flory-Fox equation,
which relates the number-average molecular weight to the glass transition temper-ature, a T
gof 37/C14C results at inﬁnite Mn. Note that these data are lower than those in
a former report by the same group [ 15]. For the MA end–PPC capped polymer, it is
found that maxima in tan dlie at 42.0/C14C (5 Hz) and 40.3/C14C (2 Hz) for PPC [ 18]. The
uncapped PPC has about 99% carbonate linkages in the backbone. A typical DMTAmeasurement of a puriﬁed PPC sample from zinc glutarate with Mn ¼46 kDa is
represented in Fig. 4and shows a T
gof around 40/C14C.
The glass temperature of PPC is readily lowered with the usual plasticizers,
which tend to be compatible with the polymer (Table 1). It is easily appreciated that
cPC thus lowers the Tgof PPC by about 2 K per weight percent. The glass
temperatures of the terpolymers have also been recorded. In the PPC containing
the (2-naphthyloxy)methyl substituent, Tgincreases with content according to the
bulky substituent, although the poly(propylene glycol) linkages, which generally36 G.A. Luinstra and E. Borchardt
lower Tg, have a higher concentration [ 51]. The outcome of a similar study with a
carbazole pending group gave very similar results [ 52]. The glass transition of the
MA-PPC terpolymer was found at around 50/C14C[39]. There are thus several options
for tailoring the intrinsic thermal properties of PPC (decomposition and glasstemperature): in a limited interval via the molecular weight and regio/stereoregu-larity, via incorporation of more or less ether linkages, or via terpolymerizationwith various heterocyclic rings, such as phthalic anhydride [ 59], butyrolactone [ 37]
(T
gonly), or cyclohexene oxide [ 50].
3 Viscoelastic and Mechanical Properties
and Processing of PPC
3.1 DMTA Analysis
Many fundamental material properties are accessible in rheological and mechanical
testing experiments [ 60]. Rheological properties are not only very relevant for
the processing of polymers, they are also the basis for understanding chain motion
and relaxation processes in (linear) polymers. Relatively few rheological studieshave been reported on PPC, often only in combination with the processing of PPC[15,61].Table 1 Plasticizing PPC with Mw of 250 kDa [ 8]

PPC (at higher temperatures) behaves like a typical pseudoplastic non-Newto-
nian ﬂuid. The activation energy of the viscosity in dependence of shear rate(284–2846 Hz) and Mn was detected using a capillary rheometer in the temperaturerange of 150–180
/C14C at 3.0–5.5 kJ/mol (28,900 Da) and 12–13 kJ/mol (117,700 Da)
[15]. The temperature-dependent viscosity for a PPC of 46 kDa between 70 and
170/C14C was also determined by DMA (torsion mode). A master curve was con-
structed using the time–temperature superposition principle [ 62] at a reference
temperature of 150/C14C (Fig. 5) (Borchardt and Luinstra, unpublished data). A
plateau for G0was not observed for this molecular weight. The temperature-
dependent shift factors a Twere used to determine the Arrhenius activation energy
of about 25 kJ/mol (Borchardt and Luinstra, unpublished data).
A DMA study close to the Tgof a PPC sample of about the same molecular
weight (Mw ¼177 kDa, polydispersity index, PDI ¼3.71) and of MA end–PPC in
tensile mode gives also one symmetrical damping peak. A tensile modulus of over
10 MPa was found after passing through the Tg(ending at over 90/C14C). This was
attributed to the high entanglement density. A master curve at a temperature of40
/C14C (Fig. 6) gives almost a plateau at 5 Hz for E0. An estimation of the entangle-
ment molecular weight (M e) from the frequency-dependent Young modulus was
17 kDa (Wang, Polymer Material Engineering Lab, Changchun Institute of AppliedChemistry, personal communication). An analysis using the Williams-Landel-Ferry(WLF) theory gave insight into the molecular motions and the activation energiesinvolved with it. It was found that in the vicinity of T
g, PPC has a large activation
energy of 500 kJ/mol, whereas MA end–PPC has only half of the value. Also, the
curves for PPC are much steeper with temperature than for MA-PPC. PPC is thusmore sensitive to temperature changes than MA
end–PPC [ 18]. The fractional free
volume near Tgwas also calculated in the study. These were almost twice as high
(0.045) as the universal (usual) fraction free volume of about 0.025 [ 63].
An essential work of fracture (EWF) analysis of PPC was performed using PPCs
of various Mn [ 21]. It was found that, independent of the Mn, load versus displace-
ment curves are similar and can thus be compared. A signiﬁcant amount of plastic

deformation in PPC takes place as samples are elongated and deformed, particularly
in low molecular weight products. The fracture toughness of a 141 kDa PPC wasdetermined to be 12.6 kJ/m
2, close to the value of PP and polyvinylchloride (PVC).
The former number increases with molecular weight (9.1 kJ/m2at Mn ¼29 kDa).
3.2 Mechanical Testing and Processing of Blends and Composites
Puriﬁed PPC (Mn ¼50 kDa, PDI /C251) was mechanically tested on dumb-bells.
The Tgof the sample was not reported. The Young modulus was found to be
830 MPa, with elongation at break of 330% and a tensile strength of 21.5 MPa[32]. Incorporation of exfoliated layered double hydroxide (max. 5%) leads to a
convincing increase in modulus, but a sharp decrease in elongation at break. For
a commercial thermally stable PPC of Mn ¼260 kDa (PDI /C255), a tensile modulus
of about 680 MPa (tensile strength of 17 MPa) was reported [ 24]. The PPC,
commercialized by China Bluechemical, was reported to have a tensile strengthof only 4.7 MPa (with a T
gof 20/C14C) [7]. This material is of lower molecular weight
(Mn¼70 kDa by gel permeation chromatography; polydispersity index ¼3.2).
As mentioned above, the material property proﬁle of PPC is unlike that of any of
the large-scale applied engineering thermoplastic polymers, nor does it resemblethat of rubbers, i.e., with the exception perhaps of some types of PVC [ 64]. One
favorable property of PPC of sufﬁcient molecular weight ( >4M
e) is the large
elongation at break. This makes it possible to use (inorganic) ﬁllers to increase theelastic modulus in a range useful for the preparation of containers, and still retain anacceptable toughness. For examples, see the following references [ 65–72]. PPC
tends to be compatible with ﬁllers or other polymers, or can be made compatiblewith them using additives. A few recent examples are incorporated here. It was
Fig. 6 Master curves of E0versus frequency of PPC and MA end/C0PPC at a temperature of 40/C14C,

found that glass ﬁbers are well dispersed in PPC matrix [ 24]. The mechanical and
thermal properties of PPC are improved to such an extent that they reach a Vicatsoftening temperature of 50
/C14C. The elongation at break is reduced to 8% with 10%
glass ﬁbers and to 0.5% with 40%. This is typically observed for the elongation of
composites with PPC. The same effect was found in a more sophisticated compositeof PPC with starch, calcium carbonate, and poly(ethylene- co-vinyl alcohol) [ 73].
An older study on a composite of PPC with untreated calcium carbonate is thusimproved [ 74,75]. It was observed that the micrometer-sized ﬁller disperses well
into the PPC matrix, although the smaller nanoparticles showed a tendency toagglomerate. The Young modulus and the yield strength for the former increasedwith 10 wt% ﬁller to 1,700 MPa and 32 MPa, respectively. The tensile strength also
increased with calcium carbonate content, which is attributed to a good binding
between the particles and the matrix. The elongation at break decreases linearlywith the ﬁller content to an excellent level of 300% at 30 wt% calcium carbonate of38mm particle size. PPC is also compatible with polybenzamide [ 76]. This blend
shows improved thermal and mechanical properties. A further example of such ablend is that of PPC with poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and a small amountof poly vinyl acetate (PVA) for compatibilization and leads again to the sameconclusions, with PVA playing an important role [ 77].
4 Solubility and Chain Extension
Little is known about the chain dimensions of PPC in solution. Recently, a
comparison of the hydrodynamic volume of polystyrene (PS) and PPC has been
reported for tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent in connection with a size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) analysis [ 78,79]. The basis for the calculation was the
assumption of an immortal PO/CO 2alternating copolymerization, and thus that
absolute values of Mn relate to starter and PO/CO 2ratios. Narrow molecular weight
distributed PPCs with various molecular weights were prepared from adipic acidas starter. The absolute molecular weight has a relationship of KM
(a+1)¼K(PS)
M(PS)(a+1), where aandKare the Mark–Houwink parameters of alt-PPC and PS,
respectively [ 80]. Using the calculated absolute Mn (Mn_abs) values, and the
observation that log(Mn_abs) ¼log(0.255) þ1.09 log(Mn_rel) where Mn_rel is
the Mn value relative to that of PS. K(PPC) was calculated to be 0.063 mL/g and
a(PPC)to be 0.61 in THF. A further relationship was established for PPC in benzene:
values for K(PPC) of 0.0011 mL/g and a(PPC) of 0.8 [ 29,54]. This shows that THF is a
good solvent for PPC, and that benzene is an even better one as chain coils are moreextended. In fact, PPC may readily be dissolved in many solvents, except chemicalssuch as longer chain alkanes and alkanols, water, and ethylene glycol. Substitutedaromatic compounds and ester with, for example, butyl groups are poor solvents,
just like methanol [ 8].40 G.A. Luinstra and E. Borchardt
5 Biodegradation, Biocompatibility and Hydrolysis of PPC
5.1 Environmental Stability
The biodegradation of PPC in air, in water and in soil has been the subject of several
studies. The observations and experiences are multiple, indicating that decomposi-
tion may generally be reached, but is very dependent on the conditions. Water plays
a major role in all these processes. The surface and bulk interactions of PPC withwater are known. PPC is not very compatible with water, and thus decompositionstarts from the surface by erosion. The surface of PPC ﬁlms prepared by compres-sion molding was examined by several techniques, among them atomic forcemeasurements [ 74]. Very smooth surfaces were found, illustrating that PPC is
viscoelastic at room temperature. Water adsorption was measured after immersionin water; after several (4) hours, 1.5 wt% water was present in the ﬁlm. The contact
angle of the immersed samples did not change, showing the ﬁnal hydrophobic
properties.
The enzymatic degradation of PPC was studied in the form of a cast ﬁlm
(10–20 mm) that was exposed to an aqueous solution containing lipases from
Rhizopus arrhizus andRhizopus delamar . PPC was found to be stable in a buffer
of pH 5.6–7.2 at 37
/C14C[81]. A more elaborate research project concerned samples of
PPC immersed in buffered solutions of pH 6. A weight loss at a rate of 1 wt% permonth could be detected. Cavities were observed after 2 months. With time, the
samples absorbed more water, increasing from 3 wt% after 1 month to 10 wt% after
6 months, and the rate of decomposition increased with the water content. A deﬁnitebiodegradability was claimed in water using several lipases and also using threedifferent fungi [ 82]. A new study with carefully puriﬁed alt-PPC of high molecular
weight came to the conclusion that the material does not change its molecularweight nor distribution after keeping it in water at ambient conditions [ 23].
The degradation in soil can be much faster, although several different experi-
ences have been reported. An early decomposition study with soil burial showed
that PPC ﬁlms (cast from chloroform, 40–50 mm, Mn ¼50 kDa) are only margin-
ally attacked after 6 months [ 83]. In contrast, a beaker consisting of 140 mmo fa
starch derivative and 25 mm of PPC was found to degrade under unspeciﬁed
composting conditions in a period longer than 14 months. This is consistent withan earlier report (in Chinese) that describes the biodegradation of PPC in compost,with cell uptake, as soon as the molecular weight dropped below 6 kDa [ 84]. The
disintegration of PPC with Mn of about 50 kDa in the form of 200 mm compressed
ﬁlm at 60
/C14C in standard compost was fast [ 10]. These results are depicted in Fig. 7
and show that the sample was fully disintegrated within 3 months.
The weathering of alt-PPC in a weathering chamber was the subject of a further
decomposition study, and the results are very relevant for the use of PPC in outdoorapplications [ 23]. A thin ﬁlm of PPC on a glass substrate was used and subjected to
a temperature of 63
/C14C, humidity of 50%, and light of 250–800 nm with an energy
of 550 W/m2. It was found that the molecular weight decreased by chain scissionMaterial Properties of Poly(Propylene Carbonates) 41
processes involving hydrolysis of the carbonate entity by water to give carbon
dioxide and two alcohol-terminated chains; cPC was not found. Also, the presenceof unsaturated groups as the result of Norrish-type radical decomposition (light-induced), could not be conﬁrmed. In another study, electron beam irradiation ofPPC was found to result in a deterioration of molecular weight, concomitant withthe dose [ 85]. When the irradiation is performed in the presence of multifunctional
unsaturated isocyanurates, the formation of cPC could not be secured. The productsof such experiments are indicative of radical abstraction and coupling reactions.
The hydrolysis of PPC in solution was studied as a function of the pH value [ 86].
The viscosity of the solution was taken to monitor the progress of hydrolysis. It wasfound that the hydrolysis is very dependent on the pH. At pH 5–9 little or noviscosity decrease occurs in a period of 20 days. At a pH lower than 3 or higher than11, hydrolysis is substantial. Overall decomposition rate is faster in a basic solution(about 4,000 times faster at pH 13 than at pH 1). In this respect, PPC is more stablein acidic medium than polyester PCL or PLA. The PPC degradation experimentswere not investigated with respect to the product spectrum.
Two factors seem important for a fast decomposition which is dominated by
hydrolysis: a temperature above T
g, and a catalyst that catalyzes nucleophilic
attack. The latter is substantiated from a study by Kuran, using Lewis acids in theform of diethyl zinc [ 87]. Degradation at low concentrations of diethyl zinc yields
large amounts of cPC. At much higher concentrations of diethyl zinc, polymerdegradation is even faster. The catalytic action of Lewis acids seems to resultfrom activation of the carbonyl carbon. Complexation to the carbonyl oxygenatom was conﬁrmed by IR spectroscopy. The formation of carbonato zinc species
in the decomposition was inferred from new bands between 1,400 and 1,650 cm
/C01
and explained by electrophilic reactions of PPC. cPC is formed from zinc carbonato
species, and forms an interesting bridge to the thermal decomposition behavior andcorresponding pathways.
5.2 Biocompatibility
The in vivo degradation of PPC has been monitored for use as a surgical polymer, or
as slow-release substrate. The degradability of PPC pellets in the peritoneal cavity
of rats was found to be negligible after 2 months. The surface area was probably toosmall for substantial degradation [ 88]. No adverse reactions with respect to the
health of the animals were reported. The interaction of PPC with various bacteria
Fig. 7 Composting of PPC original and after 16, 30, and 69 days42 G.A. Luinstra and E. Borchardt
and cells (tissues) has been the subject of a detailed study. The bacterial adhesion to
PPC after 4 h was evident for Enterococcus faecalis ,Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,
Staphylococcus epidermidis ,Escherichia coli , and Staphylococcus aureus , but with
different intensity [ 74]. The number of bacteria in that time is an indicator for the
ability to degrade the PPC substrate. For the ﬁrst two strains, colonization isexpected on the basis of their ability to deal with low nutrient surroundings andto form bioﬁlms. The other bacteria adhere, but in a number that is one to two ordersof magnitude smaller. The PPC surface does not allow human HEp-2 cells to growon it. This is attributed to the low water content. The matter of biocompatibilitywith tissue was also assessed by implanting ﬁlms into mice. The ﬁlms were
removed with the tissue after 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The inﬂammatory reaction
caused by the PPC ﬁlm was weak if at all, there was no tissue necrosis, and noextended chaotic inﬂammation. Overall, the tissue response suggests that PPC has agood biocompatibility. Surprisingly, it was found that the implanted ﬁlm had amuch rougher surface, i.e., PPC ﬁlms undergo degradation in vivo. Whether themechanism of degradation is via oxidation, hydrolysis, or enzyme mediationremains without evidence. In Table 2miscellaneous properties of PPC are listed.
6 Conclusions
PPC has become an emerging material in the landscape of thermoplastic polymers.
Most of its essential properties are known. It is biocompatible and biodegradable,which makes it attractive for packaging purposes. PPC is a material with unusualTable 2 Miscellaneous properties of PPC

thermal properties. This holds true in particular for the glass transition at about body
temperature. For application as a ﬁlm, a lower Tgis desirable, whereas for applica-
tion as a container a higher Tgis a prerequisite. Through the incorporation of further
monomers the Tgcan be increased, as well as through the preparation of composites
with ﬁllers. PPC of a molecular weight over 60 kDa has a large elongation at break.This allows the blending of solid ﬁllers to a good extent before the compositebecomes extremely brittle. PPC has a moderate-to-good afﬁnity for common ﬁllers.Plasticizers such as cPC lower the T
geffectively. Several indications lead to the
assumption that the often-observed thermal decomposition at processing tempera-ture (150–200
/C14C) could be controlled as (1) more and more insight into the
decomposition pathway become available (role of water and of catalyst residues),
and (2) more and more reports are published of PPCs that are thermally robust at a
temperature of at least 200/C14C.

Poly(3-Hydroxybutyrate) from Carbon
Monoxide
Robert Reichardt and Bernhard Rieger
Abstract The potential applications of naturally occurring poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)
(PHB) is demonstrated by a summary of its variable mechanical propertiesin comparison with different commercially available polymers. This comparisonunderlines the striking similarity to the most-produced materials in the world, thepoly(oleﬁn)s, which offers many possible applications depending on the correctpolymer microstructure. However, there is a resulting competition with regard to
product prices. When commercialization is addressed, low-cost raw materials as
well as fast and simple polymer synthesis and puriﬁcation are necessary. A brieflook into today’s biotechnological PHB synthesis is followed by a short discussionof potential raw materials. This clearly demonstrates that a non-fermentativesynthesis is desirable. Therefore, this manuscript reviews the latest results ofcatalytic PHB synthesis. Besides alternating copolymerization of carbon monoxideand propylene oxide there is special focus on ring-opening polymerization ofb-butyrolactone, which has gained increasing interest over the past decade. Since
stereocontrol is relatively difﬁcult to achieve during ring-opening polymerization,
an outlook on stereoselective monomer synthesis concludes this article.

1 Introduction
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) is a biopolymer produced by numerous bacteria in natureas an intercellular carbon and energy reserve and belongs to the class of poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s (PHAs). In 1925, the French microbiologist MauriceLemoigne discovered and characterized PHB extracted from Bacillus megaterium .
However, it is produced by a various number of microorganisms such asCupriavidus necator or Ralstonia eutroph. PHAs are biodegradable polyesters
with a structure as shown in Fig. 1.
2 Properties of PHB
Due to their fermentative synthesis, natural PHAs are strictly isotactic, featuring
exclusively ( R)-conﬁguration at the chiral stereocenter in the main chain. How-
ever, PHAs vary in their mechanical properties and can be grouped into two
subcategories:O

1. PHA SCL(short chain length; monomer unit consisting of up to ﬁve carbon
atoms)
2. PHA MCL(medium length side chains; monomer unit has more than ﬁve carbon
atoms)
PHA MCLare amorphous macromolecules with decreasing glass transition tem-
perature ( Tg) with increasing length of side chain. The reason for this is the higher
degree of motion of the main chain because the long pendant side groups
hinder crystallization. The amorphous character is responsible for the poor mechan-
ical properties of these polymers.
Within the PHA SCLpolymer subgroup, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is the
most commonly found. Natural PHB molecules arrange in a right-handed helix witha double axis and repeating units of 0.596 nm. This results in a high degree ofcrystallization (55–80%) and the formation of thin crystals with a melting point ofabout 175
/C14C, which is close to the decomposition temperature at approximately
180/C14C[1]. Thus PHB is the naturally occurring biodegradable polymer with the
highest melting transition known to date. This impressive temperature resistance of
such a biopolymer encouraged many researchers to reexamine the mechanicalproperties of this material (Tables 1and2).
With regard to Young’s modulus, tensile strength, or impact strength ( R)-PHB
can compete with other commodity polymers and is notably similar to isotacticpolypropylene (i-PP) (Fig. 2). There is also a signiﬁcant analogy between these two
materials regarding UV resistance and oxygen permeability, which speciﬁcallydemonstrates the potential of this biopolymer as a packaging material. However,
Fig. 2 also clariﬁes the main problem in replacing i-PP by PHB. Pressed boards of
PHB show a ﬂexible behavior, but after ageing for a certain number of days undernormal conditions they become brittle because of continual crystallization. Thus,the strain elongation of PHB (3–8%) is much lower than that of i-PP (400%) [ 4–6].
Addition of nucleating agents and a suitable post-treatment after extrusion canimprove these properties [ 7], but the very high melting temperature of PHB is too

ester pyrolysis during melt processing, thus making compounding to the ﬁnalproduct difﬁcult and expensive. In order to produce a material that can replacecommodity polymers in everyday applications, the melting temperature must belowered and strain increased, which means that crystallization of the polymerchains has to be reduced.
The ﬁrst time that PHB was introduced into the market in 1982, ICI avoided
these deﬁciencies by use of random copolymers consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate(3-HB) and hydroxyvaleriate units (HV) or 4-hydroxybutyrate units (4-HB), whichwere discovered by Wallen and Rohwedder a few years previously [ 8]. They used
Alcaligenes eutrophus because this bacterium can produce up to 80% of its dry cell
weight of the copolymer when a mixture of glucose and propionic acid is applied asnutrient. In addition, the copolymer composition can be changed by varying thefeed mixture, which allowed ICI to produce a variety of materials with different
properties over a certain range (Fig. 3, Table 3).
In the case of homopolymers, the tacticity of the chains directly inﬂuences the
material properties. Atactic PHB has an oily consistency and is of less use forplastic industry, whereas completely isotactic PHB shows comparably interestingTable 2 Properties for packaging articles

mentioned above (Fig. 4).
Doi and coworkers discovered that a decrease of isotacticity to 70–80% mainly
inﬂuences crystallization, so that an isotactic polypropylene-like material witha lower melting point between 100 and 130
/C14C can be obtained (see Table 4)[10].

able. Kricheldorf and coworkers synthesized syndiotactic PHB for the ﬁrst
time. They investigated two samples with 62% and 70% tacticity and reportedO

Young’s modulus values of 9.5 MPa and 13.4 MPa, respectively. In both cases, the
elongation to break was about 450–500%, freshly prepared ﬁlms even reached850% [ 11]. With rising degrees of syndiotacticity, the melting transition increases
linearly. Polymers of 94% syndiotacticity melt at 183
/C14C, which is slightly higher
than pure isotactic PHB. Furthermore formation of a uniform crystalline ordering in
the solid state was proven by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies
showing single and sharp transitions [ 12]. This is in contrast to variable isotactic
PHBs, which show two broad and therefore superimposing melting transitionsbetween 120
/C14C and 150/C14C[13]. One reason might be that a stereocomplex between
two enantiomeric sections is formed, as is known for poly(lactides) [ 14]. This
would offer a highly interesting opportunity to gain inﬂuence over temperaturestability as well as mechanical properties and therefore afford a new variety ofapplications [ 15].
Since there was no pathway towards syndiotactic PHB or unnatural isotactic
(S)-PHB available for a long time, a more detailed investigation on material
properties with regards to tacticity and stereocomplex formation is still missing.To date, it is not known whether syndiotactic PHBs crystallize in a similar mannerto isotactic stereoisomers and therefore possesses similar properties nor how theyare inﬂuenced by blending of polymers with different stereochemistry.
3 Degradation
There are several articles summarizing the degradation behavior of PHBstereoisomers [ 16,17] and/or its copolymers [ 18,19], therefore only some general
aspects are discussed here. Degradation can only occur if phosphate, nitrogensources, salts, temperature, and moisture favor growth of microorganisms. Theseconditions are usually found in compost and soil, but not during normal utilization,so that degradability does not disfavor daily applications.
Under aerobic conditions PHB degrades completely to carbon dioxide,
water, and humus, whereas under anaer obic environments methane is produced.
There is no production of harmful inte rmediates or by-products in either
process [ 19].
Bacterial PHB is easily degraded by a n umber of microorganisms due to the
complete ( R)-conﬁguration of the side chain s. These organisms segregateTable 4 Mechanical properties of different PHB stereoisomers [ 9]

extracellular PHB depolymerase (PhaZ) to reduce the polymer size so that smaller
oligomers can be introduced into the cell. This enzyme was isolated from manymicroorganisms, including Pseudomonas Lemoigne [20],Alkaligens faecalis
[21], and Penicillium pinophilum [22]. The work of Doi et al. using PhaZ from
A. faecalis proved that degradation of PHB decreases with increasing crystallinity
of the polymer [ 23]. In contrast to natural PHB, synthetic polymers consist of
a mixture of ( R)- and ( S)-stereoblocks. It seems that ( S)-units undergo a consider-
ably slower enzymatic degradation compared to ( R)-units [ 24,25]. Marchessault
and coworkers synthesized and separate d PHB of all atactic, syndiotactic, and
isotactic conﬁgurations [ 26,27]. Subsequent testing showed that in fractions of
high crystallinity after 50 h almost no d egradation had occurred, whereas
polymers of average tacticity were contin uously degraded with a rate only slightly
lower than that of environmental PHB. Th ere is also a second opinion. Kemnitzer
et al. investigated PHB degradation using PhaZ from Penicillium funiculosum
[25]. They observed that initial surface degradation of ( R)-stereocopolymers
was in the range of 95–81% and was slower than that of bacterial PHB,demonstrating that the conﬁguration of the stereocenter is of more importancethan the crystallinity.
Besides the investigation of stereoi somers, the degradation of copolymers
with e-caprolactone [ 24,28,29],d-valerolactone [ 24,28,29],g-butyrolacton
[30]a n d
D,L-lactide [ 31] were also studied. The trends are found to be indepen-
dent of the co-monomer. Co-monomer units within the polymer lead to anincrease of degradation rate up to ten times that of natural PHB. The reasonfor this ﬁnding is the change of crystallinity within in the synthetic material,which could by proved by various DSC mea surements of different copolymers
and compositions.
In summary, the rate and the ﬁnal state of biodegradation are strongly dependent
on the tacticity in the case of homopolymers, or of the copolymer composition. This
implies that it is possible to adjust the material’s lifetime by controlling ( R)-units in
the polymer or by changing the ratio of 3-HB to co-monomer units.
4 Determination of Tacticity
As mentioned above, the stereochemistry of the polymer microstructure is adecisive factor for both mechanical properties and degradation behavior. Thereforea simple but reliable determination method is useful.
13C NMR spectra of natural
PHB show four signals for each carbon atom of the repeating unit as long as end-
group effects are disregarded. A change of stereoregularity leads to the splitting
of each signal due to diad and triad sequences. The groups of Spassky andMarchessault showed that carbonyl carbon resonances can be directly referred tothe stereochemistry since it is resolved into two baseline separated peaks due toisotactic ( RR,SS ) and syndiotactic ( RS,SR ) diad sequences of ( R)- and ( S)-HB
repeating units [ 32,33] (Fig. 5). By integration of these two signals, the tacticity56 R. Reichardt and B. Rieger
can easily be determined. Moreover, natural PHB is optically active. A decrease of
tacticity can be followed by a change of the torsion angle. Thus a second, reliable,fast and easy method exists for variable isotactic PHBs, which can be used forveriﬁcation in industry.
5 Biotechnological Synthesis
5.1 Industrial Synthesis
PHAs are synthesized in cells of a number of microorganisms starting from acetyl-
CoA in three consecutive enzymatic catalyzed steps. A typical pathway is shown inFig.6.b-Ketothiolase (PhbA) catalyzes the reversible condensation of acetyl-CoA
to acetoacetyl-CoA. This intermediate is reduced using acetoacetyl-CoA reductase(PhbB) to
D-(/C0)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA with consumption of NADPH and is
polymerized by P(3-HB) synthase (PhbC) afterwards. The ﬁrst step during degra-
dation is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the polymer to 3-HB using P(3-HB)
depolymerase (PhaZ) or D-(/C0)-hydroxybutyrate-dimer hydrolase (PhaZc), which
is subsequently oxidized to acetoacetate by 3-HB dehydrogenase (Bdh1) whileregenerating NADH. The cycle is closed by acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS)while regenerating acetoacetyl-CoA, which is converted to acetyl-CoA and canfurther be converted in the citric acid cycle.i. atactic PHB

The industrial scale fermentative synthesis of PHA uses these pathways to
convert the typical nutrients sugar or starch to PHB, but glycerol or palm-oil can
also be applied. In addition, copolymers can be produced in this way but special
microorganisms, growing condition, and additives are needed. Thus a statistic co-monomer distribution starting from 0% (pure PHB) up to 90% co-monomer contentcan be achieved [ 35–38].
For the production of PHB, a specially selected bacteria is used. They grow
in aqueous media during air injection at 35
/C14C. At the end of the fermentation
process about 80% of cell dry weight consists of PHB. Production is about100 kg PHB/m
3of medium (Fig. 7).
The next step in the process is the extraction of the product. The bacteria are
washed and then concentrated. The polymer is extracted by the use of organicsolvents such as hot alcohols and decanted from the non-PHA cell matter. Thesolution is pressed into water to precipitate the polymer as a white solid. In mostSCoAO

cases, one precipitation is not sufﬁcient to obtain a powder of high purity, yet after
some repetitions a polymer of up to 98% purity can be achieved. The organicsolvents are recycled in a closed circuit. Usually, further extraction steps are neededto remove disturbing lipids and other contaminations (Fig. 8).Concentrated cell

Production this way is thus complex and time consuming, therefore generating
an extremely expensive material. Even if new and low-cost feedstocks are applied
successfully in future, fermentative synthesis will remain high priced due to this
work-up process, which cannot compete with a simple poly(oleﬁn) production(Fig. 9).
5.2 Improvements in Biosynthesis
Most extraction methods proceed with a loss of PHB and decrease of molecular
weight, which has a negative impact on material properties [ 40]. A new concept
to improve the reprocessing is extraction via chemical–enzymatic digestion(CEA; German Chemisch Enzymatischer Aufschluss). The polymer is still grown
in a cell. Chemicals and cost-efﬁcient enzymes (which depend on cell type) are
added to destabilize the cell membrane, proteins, and further cell ingredients.Lots of substances become water soluble and can be washed out from the solidpolymer particles. This puriﬁcation method is more cost-efﬁcient compared to con-ventional work-up methods. A product of 99.5% purity and yield up to 95% isreported [ 41]. This shortened biochemical extraction method is not yet feasible at
the industrial scale, but is one approach to deal with the puriﬁcation problem.
A different possibility would be to synthesize PHB biologically, but without
living organisms, in a so-called bionanofabrication process. PHB synthase is ﬁrst
attached onto a surface of agarose, silicon, or gold. After addition of 3HB-CoA assubstrate, the surface polymerization takes place. Additional bovine serum albimun(BSA) allows the polymer layer to grow up to 1 mm by homogenous coverage. The
ﬁnal product could be washed out from the surface. However, it is not yet possibleto scale up the reaction for industrial purposes [ 42].
Fig. 9 Comparison of typical PHB work-up with poly(oleﬁn) production [ 39]60 R. Reichardt and B. Rieger
The disadvantages of all biochemical routes is the lack of variable tacticity in the
polymer and, even more important, the need for time-consuming puriﬁcation. PHBmaterials of feasible properties are only achieved with high production costs. In the1990s, ICI sold a copolymer of 3-HB and 3-HV (BIOPOL) for about 10–20 €/kg
whereas the price of PP was less than 2 €/kg. Therefore, a fermentative synthesis is
feasible for smaller applications but not cannot compete with packaging materials
such as poly(oleﬁn)s [ 43–45] (Fig. 10).
6 Areas of Application
As is the case with all bioplastics, PHB can be used when its environmental
performance offers beneﬁts. However, fermentative PHB has drawbacks due tothe strictly isotactic microstructure. It exhibits acceptable properties for injectionmolding, extrusion, and thermoforming and can therefore be used for rigid con-
tainers and bottles for dairy products or, in one of the most important product
segments, catering products such as trays, cups, plates, and cutlery [ 3]. These
products can then simply be composted after use together with any remainingfood scraps. This speciﬁc business could be interesting because PHB is known tobiodegrade in both aerobic and anaerobic environments [ 19,46]. The latter offers
the possibility to convert such waste to methane in a biogas plant and therebyproducing electricity. By this means, the energy of the material can be recoveredand utilized by already existing infrastructure.
However, the most established market for biodegradable polymers today is
ﬂexible ﬁlms. These can be used for compostable waste bags or carrier bags tocollect organic waste. With increasing amounts of collected waste they help toreduce landﬁll and improve the composting process and resulting compost quality.In agriculture, biodegradable mulch ﬁlms, which can be ploughed into the ﬁeld afteruse, certainly offer the chance to reduce labor and disposal costs.

can be used as service packaging for snack foods and as ﬁlm packaging for foods
[47]. It should be mentioned that PHB from biotechnological routes exhibits poor
adaptability for such applications [ 3]. As discussed above, a change in the stereo-
chemistry alters the ﬂexibility of the material and could lead to much wider
application possible today (Fig. 11).
Although PHB and corresponding copolymers exhibit great potential for substi-
tution of commodity polymers such as high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE,
Fig. 11 Compounding technologies of PHA MCLand PHB copolymers in dependence of compo-
sition and molecular weight [ 48,49]
Fig. 12 Temperature resistance of polymer classes [ 52]62 R. Reichardt and B. Rieger
LDPE), polypropylene (PP), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET) [ 48], completely new areas of application are preferred in which
biodegradability is required for admission, such as applications in the medical ﬁeld
[50,51]. The reason for this is obvious. When new materials enter the market, they
are in competition with already established materials. In the case of PHB, due to itstemperature stability, a competition with poly(oleﬁn)s arises for all applications inwhich biodegradability is not required by law (Fig. 12).
7 Consideration of Raw Materials
Like over 90% of all biodegradable polymers, PHB is exclusively produced by use
of microorganisms from renewable feedstocks as mentioned above. Since globalproduction capacities for bioplastics are expected to grow to approximately amillion tons by 2011, the need for low cost and readily available feedstocks isapparent. The main resources are sugar or starch, but glycerine or palm-oil can alsobe used [ 3,53]. Sugar is derived from sugar cane or sugar beet, and starch mostly
from corn, wheat, or potatoes.
Taking into account that in 2009 about 38% of the 185 million tons of polyoleﬁns
produced were used as packaging materials, a potential market of 70 million tons “isavailable” in this sector. It is undisputed that the high purchasing cost surchargesresulting from fermentative synthesis can be offset when disposal or labor costs arelower. In addition, market studies generally reveal high consumer acceptance andwillingness to spend more money for environmentally friendly materials, but all thisis generally only acceptable for niche products in smaller markets. When consider-ing large scale applications, a reliable and economically raw material is essential.
Sugar prices have shown a high volatility in the past 5 years due to changing biofuel
demands or poor yields. Starch as raw material is in competition with the risingdemand for food acreages due to the ever-increasing world population. Therefore,crude oil is still considered as an essential raw material for material production in thefuture. Low investment is expected due to the established value-added chain, whichpromotes lower prices for the end consumer. For this reason, petrochemical-basedbiodegradable polymers are growing in today’s markets.
8 New Routes Towards PHB from Fossil Fuel-Based
Monomers
8.1 Retrosynthesis of PHB
From a retrosynthetic point of view, propylene oxide (PO) and carbon mono-
xide (CO) are promising building blocks for the production of low-cost PHB(Fig. 13).Poly(3-Hydroxybutyrate) from Carbon Monoxide 63
CO is derived from a variety of feedstocks such as petroleum gas, fuel oil, coal,
and biomass. The industrial scale production of PO starts from propylene, whichis mainly obtained from crude oil. However, due to the high importance of thiscompound, many pathways from renewable sources have additionally been devel-oped [ 54]. PP is converted to PO by either hydrochlorination or oxidation [ 55]. The
use of chlorine leads to large amounts of salts as by-products, therefore oxidation
methods are more important, such as the co-oxidation of PP using ethylbenzene orisobutene in the presence of air and a catalyst. However, this process is economi-cally dependent on the market share of these by-products, thus new procedureswithout signiﬁcant amounts of other side-products have been developed, such as theHPPO (hydrogen peroxide to propylene oxide) process in which propylene isoxidized with hydrogen peroxide to give PO and water [ 56,57] (Fig. 14).
Many researchers are investigating the conversion of these two feedstocks.
It offers the possibility for a future technical process in which PHB is produced
without side-products in an analogous way to the synthesis of poly(oleﬁns). More-over, the use of low-cost monomers from the established value-added chain gener-ally avoids high-price renewable raw materials or discussion about food acreages.
8.2 Direct Alternating Copolymerization of PO and CO
In 1963, Heck reported the ring opening of propylene oxide by the carbonylatingreagent tetracarbonylhydridocobalt(I) in the presence of carbon monoxide, which
results in a stable acyl cobalttetracarbonyl compound (Fig. 15). However, no
polymeric products were reported, which would result from multiple ring openingand CO insertion processes [ 58,59].
The opened epoxide shown in Fig. 15is also an intermediate in the catalytic
ring expansion of epoxides to b-lactones (see Sect. 8.4). In this context, Drent
and coworkers patented a catalytic system of dicobaltoctacarbonyl Co

3-hydroxypyridine, which primarily afforded b-butyrolactone ( b-BL) [ 60]. How-
ever, Alper and coworkers reproduced only 15% b-BL and found 75% polyester
with a weight-average molecular weight ( Mw) of 3,000 g/mol (polydispersity index,
PD¼1.2). No comment was given about whether these oligomers were generated
by ring-opening polymerization (ROP) or by other reaction mechanisms [ 61].
Using online in-situ attenuated total reﬂectance infrared (ATR-IR) techniquesRieger and coworkers were able to prove that an alternating copolymerization ofPO and CO occurs under these conditions instead of a ROP of the b-lactone side-
products [ 44,62–65].
The mechanism of the alternating copolymerization is shown in Fig. 16. First,
the polarization of the epoxide is achieved by coordination of the oxygen atom to
the Lewis acid. A too-strong Lewis acidic species results in an immediate ringopening of the monomer, which either gives acetone as one product or inducesROP, affording poly(propylene ether). However, less Lewis acidic compoundsallow the nucleophilic attack of the [Co(CO)
4]/C0-anion on the less-hindered epoxide
carbon atom, affording an alkylcobalttetracarbonyl compound. Carbon monoxide issubsequently inserted to yield the corresponding acyl compound, which is stableunder CO pressure. This intermediate can then react in two different ways.
Depending on the Lewis acid, a backbiting reaction can occur to produce b-lactone
under regeneration of the active species [LA]
+[Co(CO) 4]/C0. All investigations
proved that pyridine plays a prominent role for the second route, the alternatingcopolymerization of PO and CO. After cleavage of the tetracarbonylcobaltate by thearomatic base, the next PO unit can be inserted in a concerted step into the growingchain by activation and ring opening by [Co(CO)
4]/C0. A subsequent CO insertion
gives the same functional group at the end of the chain as that present at thebeginning of the polymerization. These repeated steps yield polyhydroxybutyrate
by multisite catalysis and can be monitored easily by in-situ ATR-IR (Fig. 17).
Similarly, a more step-like growth mechanism might be considered. Thereby,
the ring-opened epoxide after carbonylation would result in a polyester buildingblock and be transferred to a growing polyester chain, leading to a chain elongationby one segment (Fig. 18). However, experimental studies could not substantiate this
hypothesis [ 62].
The molecular weights of the produced polymers are quite small, ranging from
4,000 g/mol to 7,000 g/mol. The products feature an atactic microstructure, which is
not desired for industrial purposes. Many other catalytic systems were investigated,
such as Zn[Co(CO)
4]2and Hg[Co(CO) 4]2[62]. Small improvements were achieved
by using Ph 3SiCo(CO) 4as catalyst-precursor since this compound is able toOH

The achieved molecular weights are too low for practical applications but offerthe possibility to examine chain termination reactions. Figure 19shows that the
MALDI-TOF spectra of these polymers consists of three major peaks sets. The
most intensive signal (A) correlates to PHBs bearing one hydroxyl and one carbox-ylic acid end group, which result from hydrolytic cleavage of the cobalt–acyl bondor acyl–pyridine bond by residual water in the system or from polymer work-up.Signal B (18 mass units lower) can be allocated to polymer chains bearing oleﬁnicend groups, which can also be identiﬁed in the isolated polyester by

elimination of water, but also from a known retro-Michael addition via a six
membered transition state. This reaction is believed to occur even at room temper-ature but signiﬁcantly accelerates at higher temperatures. A further probable side
reaction leads to the signal group C. A redox reaction of an acyl-cobalttetracarbonyl
with an alkyl-cobalttetracarbonyl complex affords the keto-coupled polymer chain[66,67].
Application of racemic propylene oxide affords a viscous, oily product of an
atactic microstructure. If enantiomerically pure ( R)- or ( S)-PO is used the reaction
proceeds with comparable rates but a crystalline isotactic PHB is obtained,indicating that the stereocenter of the ring is not affected during polymerization.Analysis of the
13C carbonyl resonances in the NMR spectra of these polymers was
used to prove the isotactic structure (the signal of the racemic r-dyad is absent). This
ﬁnding was further investigated by looking at the optical rotation of the products.The [ a]
lof isotactic PHB from ( R)-PO is negative; a value of /C03.7 was measured in
CHCl 3at 25/C14C,l¼589 nm. The corresponding material received from ( S)-PO
shows an inverse optical behavior, whereas atatic polymers from rac-PO gives
no optical rotation. The comparison with natural isotactic PHB [( R)-conﬁguration,
negative [ a]lof/C03t o /C04] proves that the alternating copolymerization reaction
occurs with retention of conﬁguration of the epoxide monomers [ 68]. This knowl-
edge was used to produce variable isotactic PHB by mixing different ratios of the
(R)- and the ( S)-enantiomers. The isotacticity of the polymer can be adjusted so that
the melting temperatures can be controlled in the range 102–130/C14C[44] (Table 5).
Alper and coworkers investigated the inﬂuence of more bulky bases (2,20-
bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, and 6,7-dihydro-5,8-dimethyldibenzo[b,j]-1,10-phenantroline) and para-toluene sulfonic acid ( p-TsOH) as proton source (proton
functions as a Lewis acid). In the presence of p-TsOH a molecular weight up
to 10,000 g/mol was reported. This could be slightly increased by the use of
benzylbromide instead of p-TsOH, forming PhCH
2COCo(CO) 4as catalyst in situ.
In this case, a molecular weight comparable to that found in Rieger’s work wasachieved, but the polymers remain atactic [ 69].
To date, no catalytic system has been found that converts racemic PO to tactic
PHBs. Since the synthesis of enantiopure PO is very expensive, only racemicPO can be used on an industrial scale. Therefore, other pathways to yield feasiblematerials are area of investigation.

8.3 Ring-Opening Polymerization of b-BL
8.3.1 General Aspects
A more promising way to yield PHB of a desired microstructure is the ROP
ofb-butyrolactone ( b-BL), which has gained much attention in the past two
decades. b-Lactones are readily available, for example by carbonylation of the
corresponding epoxides (see Sect. 8.4). It has to be mentioned that b-lactones differ
in polymerization behavior compared to other homologous compounds such
asd-valerolactone, e-caprolactone or D,L-lactide. These rings open exclusively
by acyl-cleavage to afford reactive alkoxy end groups, whereas in b-lactones
a cleavage of b-carbon and oxygen can also occur, giving carboxylic groups
as propagating species (Fig. 20). The ﬁrst mechanism proceeds with retention of
the stereochemistry, whereas the nucleophillic attack on the b-carbon leads to
inversion. Which mechanism is apparent depends on the nature of the nucleophileas well as on the catalyst and reaction conditions. In addition, both mechanismsmay be operative during ROP, which is highly important when addressing stereoin-
formation of the polymer [ 70].
ROP of b-lactones is highly prone to numerous side reactions, such as transester-
ﬁcation, chain-transfer or multiple hydrogen transfer reactions (proton or hydride).Speciﬁcally, the latter often causes unwanted functionalities such as crotonate andresults in loss over molecular weight control. Above all, backbiting decreases chainlength, yielding macrocyclic structures. All these undesired inﬂuences are depen-dent on the reaction conditions such as applied initiator or catalyst, temperature,solvent, or concentration. The easiest way to suppress these side reactions is the
coordination of the reactive group to a Lewis acid in conjunction with mild
conditions [ 71].b-BL can be polymerized cationically and enzymatically but,
due to the mentioned facts, the coordinative insertion mechanism is the mostfavorable. Whereas cationic and enzymatic mechanisms share common mechanis-tic characteristics, the latter method offers not only the possibility to inﬂuence

mechanical properties by change of stereoregularity, but also by introduction of
different pendant groups via copolymerization with other cyclic esters [ 71–73].
Therefore, the focus is on coordinative ROP.
When considering commercialization, it has to be taken into account that most of
the catalysts comprise metals that vary in toxicity. These compounds have either tobe removed from the material after synthesis, which is very expensive and thuscompensates raw material beneﬁts, or when they remain in the compoundedproduct, the necessary regulations must be adhered to, which permit very lowmetal concentrations. Thus extremely active catalytic species are required.
8.3.2 From Heterogeneous to Discrete Organometallic Compounds
There are several catalytic systems reported to date, which all differ in the structure
or nature of Lewis acid or initiator and, consequently, in generated polymer
structure. As mentioned before, a deﬁned stereochemistry is of high importance
for industrial applications. Schue and coworkers observed that the reaction productof water and isobutylaluminum (Al iBu
3) or tetraisobutylaluminoxane (TIBAO)
catalyzes the ROP of b-BL. The resulting polymeric product was inhomogeneous
and, by fractionation with acetylacetone, a high molecular weight isotactic-enriched ( P
m¼0.75) polymer was separated from atactic polymers. Though high
molecular weights of approximately 300,000 g/mol can be achieved, the broad PDof 6 and comparably low activity (reaction times up to 7 days were required)
demonstrate the limits of this catalysis [ 74]. The activity can be increased if
alumoxane derivatives were ﬁrst reacted with small amounts of b-BL. Thus full
conversion can be achieved within 20 min yielding again a mixture of isotactic andatactic polymer with a molecular weight up to 120,000 g/mol (PD 5.2) [ 30]. Higher
degrees of tacticity were found, if chiral cobalt salens were added to the reactionmixture. Takeichi et al. claim an adduct of Co(Salen) and AlEt
3as a stereoselective
catalyst. However, the activity was signiﬁcantly decreased, so reaction timesup to two weeks were required to form polymers of low molecular weight
(M
w<10,000 g/mol) [ 75]. The application of aluminum-based porphyrins (Fig. 21)
with low activities results in atactic materials with Mn<7,000 g/mol. But these
catalysts were useful to investigate the propagation mechanism. Thus, an exchangeof the axial ligand X by the monomer and subsequent nucleophillic attack of Xinitiating the ring-opening was conﬁrmed by NMR spectroscopic studies. It wasshown that the exchange of carboxylate groups on (porphinato)aluminum occursmuch faster than the insertion of b-lactone into aluminum-carboxylate bonds.
Interestingly, (TPP)AlCl is also capable of initiating the oligomerization, but with
much slower rates compared to alkoxy or carboxylate species [ 76].
On the basis of these results, Spassky et al. developed chiral aluminum salens
and tested them in the ROP of racemic b-BL (Fig. 22). (R)-1,1- binaphthyl-
substituted salens convert up to 50% monomer in 7 h at moderate temperatures(70
/C14C) yielding slightly isotactic-enriched PHB ( Pm¼0.66) with molecular
weights of 13,000 g/mol and narrow PD (1.1). The activity of cyclohexyl70 R. Reichardt and B. Rieger
derivatives are higher, but only oligomers (number-average molecular weight,
Mn¼1,000 g/mol) of same tacticity degree are obtained [ 77].
Interestingly an analogous approach was reported with another heterogeneous
catalyst, which is prepared using diethyl zinc (ZnEt 2) and H 2O in a similar fashion.
This zinc oxide is more active but atactic polymers are obtained if racemic b-BL
is applied. So, a molecular weight of 35,000 g/mol (M w) is achieved in 5 days
[7]. Le Bourgne and Spassky showed that addition of a chiral diol during catalyst
preparation changed the morphology of the heterogeneous catalyst so that iso-tactic polymers can be produced. This catalyst predominantly incorporates the(R)-enantiomer in the chain. Besides ZnEt
2, AlEt 3and CdMe 2were also investi-
gated, showing the following trend regarding activity: Zn >Al>>Cd, the latter
polymerization preferentially incorporating the ( S)-enantiomer [ 78] (Fig. 23).
From these observations Coates developed discrete zinc complexes and tested
them in the ROP. In solid state as well as in solution, a dimer is formed, which
cleaves into two single-site catalysts after addition of b-BL (Fig. 24).N NN N

These (BDI)ZnOR complexes yield a molecular weight up to 200,000 g/mol by
full conversion, and comparably short reaction times of up to 2 days. This reaction
proceeds under mild conditions giving narrow PD (1.1–1.2), and the reportedproportional ratio between conversion and molecular weight throughout the reac-tion is consistent with a living polymerization in solution as well as in bulk [ 34,79].
Though several substitutions were carried out, no (BDI)Zn catalyst was found togenerate tactic materials (Fig. 25).
In the 1990s, Gross and coworkers reported that tributyltinmethoxide
(Bu
3SnOMe) initiates the ROP of b-BL and generates oligomers with a modest
degree of syndiotacticity (0.60 <Pr<0.70). The very slow polymerization takes
more than 2 weeks to convert 70% of the monomer under mild reaction conditions(75
/C14C). By decreasing the temperature to 40/C14C, the highest tacticity was observed
but reaction times of 55 days were necessary for 30% conversion [ 80]. Further
investigations showed that Bu 2Sn(OMe) 2was more active. After 2 days of poly-
merization at 40/C14C, 60% conversion was achieved with invariant tacticity. Gross
and coworkers performed the reactions at high catalyst concentrations, thereforegaining oligomers ( M
n<10,000 g/mol) but with increasing monomer-to-catalyst
ratio Mncould be increased up to 84,000 g/mol [ 81]. Later, further alkyl tin
compounds such as Bu 4-xSn(OMe) x, (Bu 3Sn)2O, or (Ph 3Sn)2O were investigated,
but productivity of these systems remained low [ 81–83]. Kricheldorf and coworkers
demonstrated that a higher steric hindrance has a positive effect on stereoselectivitybut negatively inﬂuences productivity [ 11,84].
Only slight changes in the catalyst structure to Bu
2Sn(OR)Cl result in moder-
ately active distannoxane catalysts (Fig. 26). Hori et al. reported on quantitative
conversion within 16 h and constant syndiotacticity of Pr¼0.70. The higher
activity made it possible to run the reactions with lower catalyst concentrations
(catalyst:monomer 1:8000–1:16000), affording high molecular weight polymerswith M
wof 840,000 g/mol [ 85]. A study of the mechanism indicated that diastereo-
meric interactions between the stereocenter of the last incorporated monomer unitand free b-BL is responsible for the observed stereoselectivity, so-called chain-end
control [ 86]. However, this reaction never became interesting from a commercial
point of view, especially due to the high toxicity of Sn compounds and also due toa lack of control of chain growth, so no linear relation between monomer:catalystN

ratio and obtained molecular weight was found. A further development to single-
site tin-based catalysts was therefore not performed, so that discrete organometalliccatalysts that convert racemic b-BL to tactic polymers remain rare.

catalysts started in 1994, when Le Borgne et al. observed that yttrium(2-
methoxyethoxide) is a very efﬁcient initiator for the ROP of b-BL. The reaction
at room temperature gives atactic polymers with modest activities (65% conversion
in 45 min). In addition, the yttrium-catalyzed polymerization exhibits some living
character, allowing the synthesis of deﬁned homo- and block-copolymers [ 88]. This
result encouraged Carpentier to closely examine rare earth metal complexes,especially yttrium compounds. In 2006, he reported on amino-alkoxy-bis(pheno-late)yttrium complexes, which combine high activity under very mild conditions,a living character of the polymerization, and a high degree of stereoselectivity [ 89]
(Fig. 27).
These complexes give full conversion of b-BL in less than 1 h at room tempera-
ture, affording narrowly distributed polymers (PD <1.2) and high syndiotacticity
of up to P
r¼0.94. Moreover, there is a high control over the polymerization. The
obtained molecular weight is coincident with theoretical values when taking intoaccount that each catalyst molecule initiates one chain. NMR spectroscopic studiescould prove that in both cases the initiating nucleophile N(SiHMe
2)2or OiPr opens
the coordinated b-BL via acyl-cleavage with retention of the stereogenic center and
is hence bound to the chain, giving amide or ester chain-ending, respectively(Fig. 28).
The last incorporated stereocenter is now responsible for the enantiofacial
discrimination, as was the case for tin-alkoxides, which was shown by detailed

Bernoullian analysis. In most cases, the extent of this chain-end control can be
adjusted by varying the ligand substituents, especially in the ortho -position. The
greater the steric demand in this area, the higher the stereoselectivities. This givesthe possibility to synthesize different materials by changing the ligand. It should bepointed out that this stereoregular living polymerization works well in toluene as
solvent, but loses stereocontrol in donating solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF).
Obviously the donating solvent molecules compete with b-BL for the free coordi-
nation sites on the metal center, not only lowering the activity but also hinderingenantiofacial discrimination [ 12].
Besides the development of yttrium-based catalysts, Carpenier and coworkers
also investigated Sc and La compounds with different ligand motifs of even highersteric demand near the Lewis acid center (Fig. 29). Thiophene derivatives give
slightly syndiotactic-enriched polymers ( P
r<0.70) whereas pyridine-substituted
complexes also convert racemic b-BL to syndiotactic polymers with higher
stereocontrol ( Pr¼0.87). In addition, a similar living ROP comparable to amino-
alkoxy-bis(phenolate)yttrium complexes was observed that included the sametrends, such as solvent dependency.
A simple comparison of these complexes (Table 6) demonstrates that Sc
compounds are nearly inactive, thus only slightly tactic oligomers can be obtainedat higher temperatures. Yttrium compounds are most active, though their activityis much lower compared to the amino-alkoxy-bis(phenolate)yttrium discussed
previously. It has to be mentioned that electron-withdrawing SiPh
3groups in the
ortho -position on the naphtolate rings give active catalysts, but introduction of
electron-donating SiMe 2t-Bu affords inactive complexes. Thus, improvements of
catalytic activities may be possible by varying electronic effects in this position [ 90].
More rare earth metals have been investigated by Trifonov in the case of
substituted bis(guanidinate) alkoxide complexes (Fig. 30). Surprisingly, these
catalysts convert racemic b-BL to highly syndiotactic-enriched polymers (0.80 <
Pr<0.90), though they show no stereoselectivity in ROP of lactide [ 91], which is
in contrast to the zinc complexes mentioned before, which show signiﬁcant stereo-
speciﬁcity in ROP of lactide [ 92] but only produce atactic PHB [ 34]. The polymer-
ization proceeds with moderate activity at room temperature affording narrowlydistributed polymers. Again yttrium showed the best activity amongst tested rare-earth metals sharing common characteristics of chain-end controlled living ROP.
All the above-discussed rare-earth metal complexes convert racemic b-BL to
either syndiotactic or atactic polymers. Indeed, there is only one variant exampleN

(Pm¼0.85) gained from silica-supported Nd complexes giving polymers of Mnup
to 12,000 g/mol within 16 h (Fig. 31). Interestingly, the unsupported corresponding
initiators afford lower molecular weights and an atactic polymer microstructure.Since homologous La complexes give atactic materials independent of support of
the catalyst system, this effect cannot be expected for a wide range of complexes [ 93].
It is apparent that the stereoselectivity is surface-induced; however, no statementconcerning mechanism or end groups of this polymerization has been reported.The chances to clarify in detail the reason for this stereospeciﬁc reaction are rathersmall. A full understanding of this type of reaction is necessary in order to increaseactivity and molecular weight, so developing a heterogeneous catalyst that fulﬁllsindustrial requirements from these developments will be hard to achieve.NN

8.3.4 Dual Site ROP
A completely new type of ROP catalyst was recently reported by Rieger and
coworkers. Chromium salphen complexes (Fig. 32) convert racemic b-BL to
slightly isotactic-enriched PHB (0.60 <Pm<0.70) with a molecular weight of
up to 800,000 g/mol (PD up to 8.5). These catalysts combine high activity and high
molecular weight products, featuring the desired stereocontrol at moderate reaction
conditions [ 13].
This ﬁnding was surprising because these molecules exhibit a planar, achiral
structure and raises the question of the reason for the observed stereocontrol.A chain-end control mechanism such as that found in rare-earth catalysis wasneither supported by NMR spectroscopic analysis nor experimentally. Therefore,intensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to examinethe nature of the transition state of the reaction. Together with additional kinetic
investigations using ATR-IR spectroscopy, the results indicate that the partial
isotactic polymer microstructure is the result of different coincidentally occurringmechanisms (Figs. 33and34)[94]. The growing chain bound to the Lewis acid can
react either with an uncoordinated or activated monomer. However, the observedstereocontrol of the ROP reaction does not result from enantiofacial b-BL discrimi-
nation on a single Cr
III(salphen) center (reaction with uncoordinated lactone). This
slightly endothermic reaction additionally leads to a cleavage of the growing chainBH

to the catalyst, causing side reactions such as transesterﬁcations and backbiting or
can react further with an activated monomer to incorporate the next monomer unitagain without stereoselectivity. These reactions are the main reason for the reportedbroad molecular weight distributions. The energetic situation changes if both the
new incorporated monomer and the growing chain are activated by a Lewis acid in
a dual-site catalytic mechanism. An energy difference between both enantiomerswas found, which favors construction of isotactic dyad sequences and is in goodagreement with the found stereocontrol of the experiment [ 13,94]. Such dual-site
catalysis has widely been discussed for epoxides and their copolymerization withCO
2[95–98] and speciﬁcally in their stereoselective ring-opening using CrIII(salen)
s[99–101], but has never been observed before in ROP of lactones.
Since this reaction combines high activity and stereocontrol, many similar
complexes have been investigated. In general, it was shown that electronic
inﬂuences of the substituents play a crucial role for the activity. t-Butyl groups in
R1and R 2position are necessary to avoid problems of solubility and aggregation in
solution. Introduction of a halogen atom into the phenylene backbone does notreduce the degree of isotacticity in comparison with the unsubstituted catalyst, butdoes signiﬁcantly improve the activity and increases the molecular weight of PHBsdue to stronger Lewis acidity.

been proven to give almost inactive complexes (X ¼CN), since binding of opened
lactone to catalyst is too strong and transfer to another b-BL cannot occur [ 94].
However, this catalysis so far suffers from many limitations. Besides a high
sensitivity towards impurities that are commonly found in commercially available
b-BL, a lack of control over the obtained molecular weight dominates. The broad-
ened PD partially results from diffusion problems in the highly viscous suspension,which can be minimized by addition of solvents. This, however, affects the micro-structure of the products, so a change from isotactic-enriched to syndiotactic-enriched polymers is observed [ 94]. Although diffusion problems are reduced, the
PD remains broad (PD <4), which demonstrates the most signiﬁcant drawback of
this reaction. To date, it has not been possible to synthesize a particular molecular
weight by changing the catalyst-to-monomer ratio.
In order to gain more control over this reaction, chromium salphen dimers were
synthesized. The synthetic route was developed in such a manner that the bridginglength between the two salphen units can easily be varied and that the synthesis ofheteronuclear metal complexes is possible. Since the ligand substitution pattern ishighly important for the activity of the catalyst as well as the characteristics ofproduced polymer, an analogous monomeric Cr(III) complex was synthesized forcomparison [ 102] (Fig. 35).
It should be mentioned that donor substitution of the phenylene backbone of the
salphen ligand was shown to have a decreasing effect on activity [ 103], which
explains the overall lower productivity compared with halogen-substituted chro-mium salphens. However, experiments clearly proved an increased activity upondimerization. Whereas the monomeric complex ( m¼4) converts about 30% of
b-BL in 24 h, producing a molecular weight of 25,000 g/mol, the corresponding
dimer yields up to 99% conversion with M
w>100,000 g/mol. Moreover, the
smaller polydispersity (PD <2) shows the better polymerization control, which
is attributed to the decreased rate of polymer chain termination. This behavior is
caused by the stabilization of the coordinated chain end by the neighboring metalcenter, as recently reported for dual-site copolymerizations of CO
2with epoxides
[104–106]. The polymeric products feature an atactic microstructure since the

bridging prevents the ideal arrangement of the two salphen units, so no stereoin-
formation is transcribed to the polymer.
It has to be taken into account that these catalysts are not yet fully developed.
Introduction of electron-withdrawing groups is suspected to increase Lewis acidity,
which inﬂuences activity, and the optimum spacer length may enable formation ofchiral polymers, but such variations are synthetically challenging.
All catalysts that are able to produce tactic and therefore industrially interesting
materials contain metals of differing toxicity. Since regeneration is rarely possibleand separation is always costly, different methods for preparing tactic materialsfrom oil-based raw materials are desirable.
8.4 Stereoselective Synthesis of b-BL and Subsequent ROP
Although exhaustive efforts have been made in the search for biologically accept-
able catalysts, there are only a few examples of low toxicity, which mainly lead toatactic polymers of little practical use. Another route to gain control over the
tacticity of PHB is the transformation of cheap building blocks to enantiomerically
pure b-BL, which can be distilled off from the catalyst and polymerized with
retention of the stereochemistry by ecofriendly initiators. This route combinesmany advantages. At ﬁrst, even toxic metal centers can be chosen since the productcan easily be separated from the catalyst and secondly, any tacticity of the polymerwill be available by simply mixing enantiopure b-BL with the racemic mixture in
the desired ratio. In this manner a ﬁne-tuning of the mechanical properties becomespossible and easily performable (Fig. 36).
8.4.1 Synthesis from Chiral or Prochiral Lactone Precursors
The ﬁrst syntheses of optically active b-BL involves more step sequences, includ-
ing fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric salts formed from ( R,S)-b-

excess (ee) ranging of 73–97% [ 107,108]. Seebach et al. reported a synthetic
route to ( S)-b-BL with an optical purity of greater than 98% using the chiral
precursor ( R)-PHB involving the pyrolysis of a cyclic orthocarbonate, which ther-
mally degrades to form the corresponding lactone [ 109]. 1990 Lenz and Gross
synthesized ( S)-b-BL at the gram scale using a ﬁve-step procedure starting from
(R)-PHB (shown in Fig. 37) yielding an ee of 97%.
The group of Roelens published an organic pathway to substituted b-lactones
from achiral b-carbonylesters via asymmetric hydrogenation using ( R)-BINAP-Ru
(II) as catalyst yielding b-lactones with an ee of 97% [ 110] (Fig. 38).
Nevertheless, all these syntheses remain less important since they use expensive
chiral or prochiral precursors that lead to costly b-BL, leading to high price PHB
that cannot compete with poly(oleﬁn) prices.
In 1985, Kwiatkowski et al. reported a tetramethyl ethylenediamine (TMEDA)-
catalyzed dimerization of ketene giving the interesting compound 4-methylene-oxetane-2-one (diketene). This substance can be hydrogenated by either Pd/C toracemic b-BL as well as by asymmetric catalysis according to Takaya et al. using
Ru complexes of ( S)-BINAP as catalyst, with an ee of 92% [ 111]( F i g . 39).

Ketene gas is the product of acetone pyrolysis with copper at temperatures higher
than 700/C14C[112]. These harsh reaction conditions require tremendous technical
setup, thus this interesting route is not feasible for large scale industrial purposes.
8.4.2 Lactone Synthesis via Ring Expansion of Epoxides
The most promising route towards variable isotacic PHB is a process in which PO is
transferred to both enantiopure and racemic b-BL in two parallel processes
(Fig. 40). As mentioned, these monomers can be distilled off from the catalysts
and polymerized directly. Thus, any degree of tacticity in the polymer can be
adjusted by mixing racemic and enantiopure b-BL, which would allow the prepa-
ration of tailor-made materials from the low-cost oil-based monomers PO and CO(cf. Sect. 8).
The carbonylation of epoxides is an extensively investigated topic. It transpires
that a single carbonylation agent is not capable of performing the reaction. There-fore, a suitable Lewis acid is necessary that electrophilically activates the epoxidefor the nucleophilic insertion of CO into the activated epoxide [ 61,63,64,69,
113,114]. Coates and coworkers showed that under CO pressure, tetracarbonyl-
cobaltate in combination with various Lewis acids [LA]
+[Co(CO) 4]/C0is the best
carbonylating system in this context so far [ 115–118] (Fig. 41). It should be noted
that (1) the ring-opening via nucleophilic attack has to be regioselective on thesecondary carbon atom to avoid formation of the regioisomer a-methyl- b-
propiolactone, and (2) the carbonylation has to be fast enough to prevent POfrom catalytic rearrangement, yielding acetone as a side-product, or to preventpolymerization. Therefore the choice of the right Lewis acid is essential.
Coates used [Cp
2Ti(THF) 2]+and [(salphen)Al(THF) 2]+as Lewis acid to convert
a variety of epoxides to racemic b-lactones, and substituted aziridines to b-lactams
in high yields under mild conditions. PO is selectively converted to b-BL in 95%
yield in 4 h at 60/C14C[117]. However, only racemic b-BL can be obtained from
racemic PO. In order to get enantiopure molecules from racemic precursors, thecatalytic system has to be stereoselective. This can generally be achieved by the useof a chiral stereo-inducing Lewis acid, which effects a kinetic resolving activation[119,120]. However, examples of the chiral resolution of PO are rare.

Jacobsen and coworkers discovered that chiral salicylimidato transition metal
complexes activate epoxides in a stereoselective manner. The published mechanismindicates that one Cr
III(salen)-N 3with ( R,R)-cyclohexyl backbone acts as Lewis
acid and coordinates to the oxygen of PO, while a second catalyst molecule transfersthe azide to the activated epoxide and thus opens the ring. The coplanar arrangementof the two chromium complexes prefers one enantiomer of PO and so induces
stereochemical information [ 99,100,121–129]. (cf. also Sect. 8.3) (Fig. 42).
Motivated by these remarkable results, the ﬁrst successful experiment to produce
enantiomerically enriched b-BL resulted when the chloride species of this chiral
Cr
III(salen) complex was reacted with Na[Co(CO) 4] and applied in ring-expansion:
a low but reproducible excess of 6% ee was obtained [ 62].
In an approach to improve the enantioselectivity, the steric demand of the
chiral salen backbone was enhanced (Fig. 43). Indeed, exchange of the ( R,R-o r[LA] [Co(CO)4]O

S,S-) 1,2-cyclohexyl bridge by the ( R,R-o rS,S-) 1,2-diphenyl ethyl unit gave the
highest enantioselectivity of 27% ee found for this complex type, at the expense ofa reduced conversion rate. Developing this idea subsequently led to the binaphthylderivative, which gave only 17% ee, demonstrating the limits of this approach.It has to be noted that such low ee was only achieved at room temperature. Thesecatalysts convert less than 10% in 4 days. However, in all experiments described so
far,R,R-salen conﬁguration resulted in the ( S)-conﬁgured b-BL product and vice
versa. This observation is in accord with the picture that a R,R(S,S-) Cr
IIILewis acid
disfavors coordination of the R(S)-PO due to repulsive interactions of the ligand
backbone and the methyl group of PO [ 130].
A ﬁrst indication of the relatively low importance of the enantiofacial discrimi-
nation of the two PO enantiomers by coordination to homochiral salen complexescame from a more detailed DFT study in which two model compounds wereinvestigated [ 130]. Interestingly, epoxide coordination, ring opening as well as
CO insertion are (in a ﬁrst approximation) reversible reactions and therefore cannot
account for the observed enantioselectivity. In this regard, the lactone-forming ringclosure sequence is the most exothermic step in the catalytic cycle and is, therefore,considered to determine the enantioselectivity.
A strategy to accelerate b-BL formation was therefore developed, consisting of
the synthesis of unsymmetrical tridentate Cr
III(Schiff base) complexes (Fig. 44) that
might open a reaction channel for this particular sequence after chloride abstractionwith Na[Co(CO)
4].
These catalysts convert PO to b-BL with an enantiomeric excess of the
(R)-enantiomer up to 33%, with an even higher reaction rate compared to theN N

classic tetradentate salen complexes [ 62,130,131]. Bildstein subsequently devel-
oped novel ligand families of Schiff base ligands and complexes. He synthesizedthree successive generations of catalysts with different substitution patterns. Higher
temperatures led to higher activities, but consequently stereoselectivity decreased.
Thus, the highest ee is achieved when tridentate Cr
III(Schiff base) (Fig. 44)i s
applied [ 131].
This enantioselective PO carbonylation is still in its infancy. Ongoing experi-
ments are being performed to understand the limitations of these catalysts in order tosuccessfully generate highly active and selective catalysts for this interesting route.This pathway may become even more valuable, since Coates recently reporteda one-pot synthesis of PHB from PO via carbonylative polymerization [ 132]( F i g . 45).
This reaction combines ﬁrst the carbonylation of PO to b-BL using the above-
described aluminia prorphyrine complexes and a subsequent catalytic ROP using(BDI)ZnO iPr in situ. Both catalysts are compatible with each other and convert
99% of the epoxide to PHB in 10 h yielding a molecular weight of 52,000 g/molwith narrow polydispersity (PD ¼1.1) without generating other byproducts [ 132].
The use of this reaction type in an industrial process would neither require isolationnor puriﬁcation of the intermediate b-BL, which is beneﬁcial in terms of production
costs. However, only atactic products can be obtained from cheap racemic PO.
In addition, the increased metallic content in the resulting polymer challenges the
development of environmentally acceptable stereoselective Lewis acids that arecompatible with ROP catalysts.
9 Conclusions
Biopolymers are certainly a product of the future. Their high eco-efﬁciency in someapplications drives the development of these plastics [ 133]. In some niche markets,
their higher production costs resulting from time-consuming puriﬁcation and lessthan ideal raw materials can be neglected, but for large-scale applications of severalmillion tons per year and real competitiveness with commodity polymers, new
catalytic routes that lead directly to the polymeric material without generation of
side-products are necessary.
In this regard, PHB is a very interesting polymer since its mechanical properties
vary over a range comparable to that of i-PP or PET. A change in PHB micro-structure would allow synthesis of tailor-made products for certain applications.This advantage, however, has some drawbacks in the commercial market. ThisOO

biodegradable polymer has to compete with the cheapest and well-established
materials known today. Therefore, a biotechnological synthesis is not feasible forapplications such as packaging, and the low-cost oil-based monomers (mainly PO
and CO) become ever more relevant.
The alternating copolymerization of PO and CO is most closely related to a gas
phase synthesis of polyoleﬁns. A multicomponent catalytic system makes it impos-sible to gain control over the stereochemistry. However, developments in this ﬁeldwould deﬁnitively enhance the potential of PHB in the market, especially ifnontoxic catalysts were found that could remain in the material after synthesis.This is also a primary challenge for ROP of racemic b-BL, which can be syn-
thesized by the catalytic carbonylation of PO. A variety of catalytic species have
been found for this process; however, the majority generate atactic polymers. Rare-
earth compounds give good stereocontrol affording syndiotactic polymers, and theliving character of the ROP allows control over molecular weight in a certain range.For industrial applications, the activity is still too low and more variety in thestereocontrol would be desirable. Highly active Cr
IIIsalphen combine acceptable
productivity and stereocontrol towards isotactic-enriched polymers, but the toxicityof the metal is a signiﬁcant drawback. In addition, this new kind of ROP of lactonessuffers from many limitations, which are hard to overcome on an industrial scale.
Another way to deal with the problem of the toxicity of the metal is the enantiopure
synthesis of b-BL from racemic PO. The extremely low activity and enantiomeric
excess of this process prohibits its application on industrial scale. In addition, thereis still a lack of catalysts that convert enantiopure b-lactones to isotactic polymers
with good polymerization control and whilst retaining high activities.
Biotechnological syntheses of PHB are still in their infancy and some problems
may be overcome in near future. However, the synthesis of biodegradable polymersin a catalytic manner offers so many advantages, not only with regards to costs,
that future development of such research is worthwhile.

K.O. Siegenthaler, A. K €unkel, G. Skupin, and M. Yamamoto
Abstract Biodegradable polymers are sustainable alternatives to standard plastics
in applications where the functional property of biodegradability is an advantage.
Ecoﬂex®is the brand name of completely biodegradable aliphatic–aromatic
polyesters produced by BASF. By the use of renewable raw materials either in
the production of Ecoﬂex®itself and/or by blending with bio-based polymers
like starch or poly(lactic acid) (PLA), biodegradable plastics with new and inter-
esting properties proﬁles are obtained. Compounds of Ecoﬂex®and PLA are
commercialized by BASF under the brand name Ecovio®. Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®
combine very good mechanical properties with complete biodegradability and are,
in certain applications, drop-in substitutes for standard plastics like polyethylene orpolystyrene. The application range is very broad: from ﬁlm applications likeorganic waste bags, shopping bags or agricultural mulch ﬁlms to knitted nets,shrink ﬁlms, coated paper board and stiff foamed packaging.

1 Introduction
Biodegradability is a property that is typically associated with naturally occurring
materials because our everyday experiences are formed by the natural circle ofbiomass generation and degradation. On the other hand, plastics as man-madematerials are known to be persistent – in many cases they are even designed tolast for as long as possible. However, biodegradation is not dependent on the origin
or the raw material base of a substance, but is only a function of its chemical92 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
structure. Thus, the term biopolymers was deﬁned (e.g., by European Bioplastics)
to be an umbrella term that includes, on the one hand, naturally occurring polymersand those made from renewable resources (bio-based polymers) and, on the other
hand, polymers that can be metabolized by microorganisms (biodegradable
polymers) [ 1]. While the term “bio-based” gives information about the origin of
the raw materials, the term “biodegradable” describes the end-of-life of a polymer.According to this deﬁnition, it is obvious that a bio-based polymer does notnecessarily need to be biodegradable and that a biodegradable polymer does notnecessarily need to be bio-based – but all of them are biopolymers.
Biodegradable plastics have been used on an industrial scale since the end of the
1990s when BASF launched Ecoﬂex
®. This is a fossil-based, man-made polyester
but yet is completely biodegradable due to its chemical structure. This structure is
also the reason why Ecoﬂex®combines excellent mechanical properties with the
good processability of synthetic thermoplastics. Ecoﬂex®is the preferred blend
partner for bio-based and biodegradable polymers, which typically do not exhibitgood mechanics and processability for ﬁlm applications by themselves. Ecoﬂex
®
therefore is a synthetic polymer that enables the extensive use of renewable rawmaterials (e.g., starch).
Ecoﬂex
®and its blends with bio-based and biodegradable polymers are designed
to be drop-in solutions for the substitution of standard plastics whenever the
functional property of biodegradability is a valuable and sustainable advantage.This gives the possibility of disposing of packaging material along with organicwaste or of plowing agricultural ﬁlms into the ground, with all the advantages thisentails from the standpoint of hygiene, disposal logistics and system costs.
To prove the ultimate biodegradability of a biodegradable polymer and that there
is no adverse effect on the user or the environment, as well as to successfully marketa plastic material as biodegradable, there are international standards in place
according to which these materials can be certiﬁed. Both Ecoﬂex
®and Ecovio®
are certiﬁed worldwide as compostable and are approved for contact with food.
The following sections will describe in detail the biodegradability of polymeric
materials in general and the standards according to which biodegradability andtoxicology are assessed, with Ecoﬂex
®as an example. The value of biodegradability,
including the eco-efﬁciency analysis (especially life-cycle assessment, LCA) to judgesustainability advantage is addressed. The chemistry, properties and processing ofEcoﬂex
®and Ecovio®are discussed. The different applications, the growth of the
market, and development of production capacities are further key aspects.
2 Biodegradability and Toxicology
Polymers are not an invention of mankind and this type of chemical material has
been known in nature for a very long time. Natural polymers are to be found in agreat variety, the most important of which are starches, cellulose, lignin, chitin,proteins and the nucleic acids.Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 93
Obviously, there is no accumulation of natural polymers because they are
recycled by biological degradation to CO 2. This is then assimilated and
reincorporated into biomass by photosynthesis. On the other hand, persistence is
a well known property of most synthetic polymers, e.g. polyethylene (PE) and
polystyrene (PS).
Although it seems obvious that there is a connection between the natural origin
of a polymer and its biodegradability this is one of the most common misunder-standings with respect to biopolymers. Biodegradability is a function of the chemi-cal structure of a molecule and there is no dependence on its origin. This is thereason why synthetic, man-made polymers can also be biodegradable if theirstructure obeys certain rules.
A polymer – no matter whether a natural polymer, a man-made polymer made of
renewable resources, or a completely fossil-based polymer – is biodegradable ifit can be metabolized by microorganisms like bacteria, yeasts or fungi [ 2].
This metabolization process occurs in natural and microbiologically activeenvironments, e.g., in surface or sea water, soil or compost. The biodegraded matteris used by the microorganisms as an energy source and, within a given time period,is converted into biomass, water, CO
2and sometimes – depending on the environ-
mental conditions – into methane.
In oxygen-rich environments, aerobic biodegradation takes place and the main
products of the degradation process are water and CO 2. This type of biodegradation
process mainly takes place in soil or compost, and a variety of microorganismsare involved [ 3]. Technically, industrial composting makes use of the aerobic
degradation of organic matter.
In surroundings where there is a lack of oxygen, an anaerobic biodegradation
process is followed and the major gaseous degradation product is methanealong with CO
2. Anaerobic degradation is typically found in aquatic degradation
processes, in landﬁlls or is used technically for the production of biogas from
biomass.
2.1 Mechanism of the Biodegradation of Polymers
To use organic molecules as a food source, microorganisms have to be able to takeup the substance and metabolize it within their cells. A prerequisite is thatthe molecules are water-soluble and that they are small enough to pass throughthe cell walls and membranes of the microorganism. Polymers are typicallynot water-soluble and, by deﬁnition, are not small molecules [ 4]. Therefore, the
biodegradation of polymers typically needs to follow four distinct steps.
The properties of polymers are not only determined by their primary chemical
structure but also by secondary structural elements. This is also true for the processof biodegradation. In a ﬁrst step, the secondary structures of the polymer, e.g.,crystals in a partially crystalline polymer, have to be dissolved during the degrada-tion process and temporarily ﬂexible chains formed.94 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
Second, the polymer needs to be broken down into small fragments.
Microorganisms excrete extracellular enzymes that cleave the polymeric chains[4]. This enzymatic cleavage reaction, on the one hand, needs functional sites
within the polymer backbone where the enzymes can catalyze the cleavage of
chemical bonds. On the other hand the polymeric chain needs to be ﬂexible enoughthat the chain can enter the catalytic site of the enzyme. In most cases, the chemicalreaction catalyzed by the exo-enzymes is a hydrolysis process that converts thepolymer chain into smaller oligomers and monomers [ 4].
As a third step, the oligomers and monomers formed need to be small enough
and water-soluble to pass through the cell walls and membranes of the microorgan-ism. Finally, within the microorganisms the fragments are ultimately converted into
water, gaseous products (CO
2or methane) and, most importantly for the microor-
ganism, to biomass and energy. Further factors that inﬂuence the biodegradationprocess are humidity and the oxygen level.
Because enzymes are too big to diffuse into the bulk of a polymer, biodegrada-
tion is an erosion process that takes place at the surface of the plastic article [ 5].
Therefore, the thickness of a plastic article is a decisive parameter in determiningthe time needed for complete degradation.
Very often, parallel to the pure enzymatic degradation, there is also degradation
triggered by other inﬂuences like chemical hydrolysis, UV light or heat. These
inﬂuences lead to polymer chain fragmentation, which follows a different mecha-nism to that of the biodegradation process. In contrast to the pure biodegradationprocess, these processes affect the bulk of the plastic piece.
2.2 Biodegradation of Ecoﬂex®
Ecoﬂex®F, the original Ecoﬂex®grade, is a completely fossil-based aliphatic–
aromatic copolyester produced by BASF (see Sect. 4). It is synthesized from1,4-butanediol, adipic acid and terephthalic acid, and is a poly(butylene adipate-
co-butylene terephthalate) (PBAT).
The biodegradation behavior of Ecoﬂex
®has been very well studied. Laboratory
tests have been performed with Ecoﬂex®to monitor the process of its biodegrada-
tion with respect to the formation of intermediates. In these tests, Ecoﬂex®was
immersed in a microbially active inoculum prepared from compost. It has beenshown by interrupting the biodegradation process and analyzing the chemicalsubstances in the medium, that Ecoﬂex
®is hydrolyzed to oligomers and eventually
back to its monomers. The complete polymer, all the oligomers, and the monomers
formed could at any stage be metabolized by more than 99% (see Table 1)[6].
No accumulation of any residues has been found (see also Sects. 2.3and2.4).
Biodegradable products are designed for applications where the functional
property of biodegradability is a sustainable feature and is of value to the customer.The products show their potential at the end-of-use phase. The preferred end-of-lifeoption for biodegradable products made of Ecoﬂex
®is composting. To make sureEcoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 95
that such products fulﬁll the requirements of a composting process, to inevitably
prove their ultimate biodegradability and that there are no adverse toxicologicaleffects deriving from intermediates and products of their biodegradation process,there are standards in place all over the world according to which biodegradableplastics can be certiﬁed.
2.3 Standards for Biodegradable Polymers
Biodegradable polymers are assessed according to local standards derived from abasic framework that is accepted worldwide. The most important standards are theEuropean Norm EN 13432, the American ASTM D 6400-04 and the JapaneseGreenPla. The international standard ISO 17088 is based on the ﬁrst two and
became effective in 2008; it can be used worldwide. All these standards deﬁne
basic requirements for packaging and packaging materials to be considered asbiodegradable and compostable in industrial composting facilities by addressingthe scheme summarized in Table 2. The results of the tests have to be certiﬁed at
registered test institutes (e.g., DIN CERTCO, Germany; Vinc ¸otte, Belgium; Biode-
gradable Products Institute, USA).
The most important proof of ultimate aerobic biodegradability is the controlled
composting test according to ISO 14855, which is the central part of every standard
named above for biodegradable polymers. The test polymer is mixed with a deﬁned,
mature compost quality in a composting vessel and incubated in a batch process.The vessel is aerated continuously with CO
2-free air at 58/C14C and at deﬁned
humidity. Thus, the composting process runs under optimum moisture and oxygenconditions. The CO
2that is released by the biodegradation process is detected to
quantify the biodegradation process. As compost itself releases a certain amount ofTable 1 Fragments of Ecoﬂex®after degradation with isolated pure strain (Tests 1–3) and with

CO 2, a blank compost inoculum without an additional carbon source (polymer
sample) is simultaneously tested under the same conditions. The CO 2content of
the exhaust air of both vessels is compared. After subtracting the CO 2evolution of
the blank inoculum, the CO 2evolution related to the test polymer is monitored and
plotted as a biodegradation curve (see Fig. 1). Finally, the activity of the compost
inoculum in the controlled composting test is validated using a cellulose referenceinstead of the polymer. In Fig. 1, the biodegradation curve of Ecoﬂex
®is depicted.
After 80 days, 90% of the theoretical CO 2evolution is reached. Thus, Ecoﬂex®is
ultimately biodegradable according to the ISO standard for compostable polymers
(ISO 17088), which requires 90% of the theoretical CO 2evolution within 180 days.
Registered biodegradable polymers are used to produce biodegradable ﬁnished
products (e.g., bags, packaging, cutlery, plates), which have to be certiﬁed inthe next step. This procedure at a certiﬁed test institute prevents the use ofnonconforming additives, colors and packaged goods. The certiﬁcate entitles theTable 2 Registration scheme for biodegradable polymers

2.4 Toxicological Assessment of Biodegradable Polymers
Apart from the pure process-driven requirements of the disintegration within a
deﬁned time span and the proof of ultimate biodegradability, it is necessary to makesure that there is no negative impact of degradation products or intermediates of thedegradation process on the environment. Adequate information has to be providedfor a comprehensive assessment of environmental and toxicological safety.
Ecoﬂex
®was tested according to the tests described in the following sections
and showed no adverse effects. These tests cover the assessment of eco-toxicologi-cal effects of the degradation intermediates and products (see Sects. 2.4.1 –2.4.3 )
as well as the product safety during the use phase (see Sects. 2.4.4 –2.4.7 ). The
results of these laboratory tests are given in Table 4[8]. Biodegradation of Ecoﬂex
®
causes no accumulation of environmentally dangerous compounds, neither in
organisms nor in the ecosystem.
2.4.1 Water-Soluble Intermediates: Daphnia Test
In the toxicity tests, the toxicity of the water-soluble intermediates is particularly
important because they can easily enter groundwater or be more readily absorbedby the organism.
Testing of Ecoﬂex
®was carried out in accordance with DIN 38412 Part 30.
In this test, the pollutant-dependent immobilization of daphnia in solutions ofdifferent concentrations (series of dilutions) is used. The control solution contains
microorganisms that are known to biodegrade the test polymer. The stock solution
at the end of the test also contains the degradation intermediates of Ecoﬂex
®.
The polymer was successively diluted with water (pH 7.0) containing
microorganisms and ten daphnia added to the test solutions for each distinctconcentration. The solutions were kept at 20
/C14C and after 24 h the number of
daphnia still swimming was counted. Even with a low dilution (stage 2), as in thecontrol solution, there were still nine daphnia swimming and the test was passed.
2.4.2 Plant Growth Test
The eco-toxicity of composted Ecoﬂex
®was studied in a plant growth test follow-
ing the European standard for compostable plastics (EN 13432, Annex E), which isbased on the OECD guideline 208. In this test, effects on seedling emergence andearly plant growth are investigated using different higher plant species exposed totreated compost. Seeds were planted into soil with compost in which Ecoﬂex
®was98 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.

previously biodegraded and into control soil with untreated compost. Four different
plant species covering the three categories outlined in OECD guidance 208 weretested: wheat ( Triticum sativum ), summer barley ( Hordeum vulgare ), mustard
(Sinapis alba /Brassica alba ) and the mung bean ( Phaseolus aureus ).
The following samples were prepared and used for testing:
 Mixture of reference soil and 25% compost with addition of Ecoﬂex
®after
12 weeks composting.
 Mixture of reference soil and 50% compost with addition of Ecoﬂex®after

The test results on seedling emergence and biomass showed no signiﬁcant
effects when treated soil was compared to the control (Fig. 2). With all four plant
species, both parameters reached at least 90% of the control level regardless of thetest concentration.
2.4.3 Earthworm Acute Toxicity Test
The eco-toxicity of composted Ecoﬂex
®was investigated in an earthworm acute
toxicity test following the OECD guideline 207 (reference). In this test, earthworms

(Eisenia fetida ) are exposed to control soil and treated soil. Earthworm mortality
and the biomass (body weight) of the surviving animals are recorded and resultsfrom treated soil are compared to the control soil. The test sample consisted of
treated compost mixed with standard soil containing a 25% test concentration.
There was no mortality in any of the treatments after 7 and 14 days. In the
control and treated soil a signiﬁcant increase of biomass compared to the start of thetest was observed. In conclusion, soil mixtures containing compost exposed toEcoﬂex
®had no adverse effects on earthworm survival and biomass development.
2.4.4 Assessment of Skin and Eye Irritation
The potential of Ecoﬂex®(powder) to cause acute dermal irritation or corrosion was
assessed by a single topical application of the test substance to the intact skin ofrabbits according to OECD guideline 404. After removal of the patch, the applica-tion area was washed off and cutaneous reactions were assessed for 72 h. Nocutaneous reactions were observed. Hence, Ecoﬂex
®(powder) is not irritating to
skin.
The potential of Ecoﬂex®(powder) to cause eye irritation was assessed in rabbits
subjected to a single ocular application of the test substance for about 24 h,according to OECD guideline 405. The ocular reactions were assessed for 72 hafter application. According to this test, Ecoﬂex
®(powder) is not irritating to
the eye.
2.4.5 Assessment of Sensitization
Ecoﬂex®(powder) was tested for its sensitizing effect on the skin of the guinea pig
in the modiﬁed Buehler test according to OECD guideline 406. Skin-sensitizingeffects were not observed in these animal studies.
2.4.6 Acute Oral Toxicity
A study was performed to assess the acute toxicity following oral application of
Ecoﬂex
®(powder) in rats according to OECD guidance 423. Single doses of
4,000 mg/kg body weight of test material preparations were given to the animals.
None of the animals tested died. Neither clinical signs nor ﬁndings of macroscopic
pathologic abnormalities were observed. The median lethal dose (LD 50) of the test
substance after oral administration was found to be greater than 4,000 mg/kg,indicating that Ecoﬂex
®shows virtually no acute toxicity after a single ingestion.Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 101
2.4.7 Assessment of Mutagenicity
Ecoﬂex®(powder) was tested for its mutagenic potential on the basis of its ability to
induce point mutations in several bacterial strains ( Salmonella typhimurium and
Escherichia coli ) in a reverse mutation assay (Ames test), according to OECD
guideline 471. Results revealed that the polyester is not mutagenic to bacteria.
3 Value of Biodegradability: Life Cycle Assessment
Biodegradable plastics are developed for special applications where the possibility
for a safe release into the environment is required. They are particularly attractivewhen economic and/or ecological beneﬁts can be gained by leaving plastic productsin the soil or organic waste stream.
To deﬁne the value of biodegradable polymers, the overall system costs and the
environmental impact of individual products in their respective target applications
have to be considered. To this end, comprehensive life-cycle assessments (LCAs)
are an appropriate tool, especially when accompanied by costs evaluations thatcover all phases from cradle to grave.
When looking at the life cycle of biodegradable plastics, two aspects are of
particular importance: the end-of-life options and the use of renewable resources inthe material production (the major part of the currently available biodegradableplastic products are made of blends of fossil-based polymers and polymers derivedfrom biomass).
By using renewable carbon from biomass, an improvement in the CO
2
balance can be achieved. However, signiﬁcant effects beyond the impacts on
greenhouse gas emissions are possible, e.g., soil modiﬁcation, eutrophication,impact on biodiversity, land requirements and water consumption. These aspectsdepend on different factors like feedstock type, scale of production, cultivationand land-management practices, location and downstream processing routes.The environmental implications of agriculture are sometimes difﬁcult to assessby the LCA methodology and require further research.
With regard to the end-of-life phase, there are different disposal routes for
biodegradable plastics.

Waste in the EU contains approximately 30–40% of organic waste. For the disposalof this organic waste, different end of-life-options are possible: landﬁlling, inciner-ation and biological treatment.102 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
3.1.1 Landﬁlling
This traditional system is still the disposal method most widely used in the EU.
In landﬁlls, biodegradable waste decomposes to produce landﬁll gas and leachate.The landﬁll gas consists mainly of methane and, if not captured, contributes
considerably to the greenhouse effect. For this reason, the move away from landﬁll
is an important part of the European Waste Framework Directive.
This Directive (amended in 2008) stimulates a more intensive utilization of
organic waste, the diversion from landﬁll, separate collection of organic wasteand treatment in a way that fulﬁls a high level of environmental protection. Itsupports the use of environmentally safe materials produced from organic waste.The Member States were requested to amend their national waste laws within2 years of its coming into force.
3.1.2 Incineration
Organic waste is usually incinerated as part of mixed municipal waste stream.
Depending on the facility and the energy use, this process can be regarded as eitherenergy recovery or as disposal. Because the moisture content in organic waste ismostly very high (about 60%), the efﬁciency of such processes is quite poor.
3.1.3 Biological treatment
Composting is the most common biological treatment option. It may be considered
as a recycling option when the resulting compost is used as fertilizer or soil
improver. Effects like increased water retention capacity and improved soil struc-
ture are ecological beneﬁts that are of particular importance when soil erosion is aserious problem (for example in some Southern European countries).
Anaerobic digestion is a method of producing biogas from organic waste for
energy purposes and, thus, could be seen as energy recovery. This waste manage-ment option is especially suitable for treating wet organic waste. In addition, theprocesses of digestion and composting are usually combined as successive steps atone facility.
3.2 Direct Release in Agricultural Applications
A nonbiodegradable agricultural ﬁlm has to be re-collected after use (labor costs)and disposed of (or recycled), generating additional costs within the system. Incontrast to PE ﬁlm, a biodegradable agricultural ﬁlm can be simply tilled into theground.Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 103
4 Ecoﬂex®: A Completely Biodegradable Aliphatic–Aromatic
Polyester
Natural polymers (e.g., starches) are found in a great variety. These abundant
substances are used for certain applications. However, their usefulness in ﬁlmapplications is heavily limited due to their poor mechanical properties andprocessability.
The discovery that there is no connection between the source of a polymer and
the property of biodegradability led to the development of man-made polymers thatcombine the property of biodegradability with the outstanding processability andproperties of synthetic plastics.
4.1 Raw Materials, Chemical Structure and Property
Proﬁle of Ecoﬂex®
4.1.1 Ecoﬂex®F: The Basic Biodegradable Polyester of BASF
At the end of the 1990s, BASF commercialized Ecoﬂex®F, a completely biode-
gradable statistical copolyester based on the fossil monomers 1,4-butanediol(BDO), adipic acid and terephthalic acid (see Fig. 3). Ecoﬂex
®F combines the
good biodegradability known from aliphatic polyesters with the good mechanicalproperties of aromatic polyesters.
Ecoﬂex
®F was designed to be a strong and ﬂexible material with mechanical
properties similar to PE. The ﬁlms are tear-resistant and ﬂexible, as well as resistantto ﬂuctuations in water and humidity. Ecoﬂex
®F is a thermoplastic and can be
melt-processed on standard polyoleﬁn equipment (see Sect. 5). It is mainly used in
ﬁlm applications. The very high toughness and failure energy represent productcharacteristics of Ecoﬂex
®F that signiﬁcantly exceed the respective properties of
PE ﬁlms.
Ecoﬂex®F is sold by BASF to converters that produce biodegradable blends
with it and ﬁnally manufacture the ﬁlm products for end use (see Sect. 4.2). BASF
also uses it for the production of Ecovio®F (see Sect. 4.2.2 ).

The most important applications of Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®are applications
where biodegradability is an advantage, e.g., short-lived plastic ﬁlms like organicwaste bags, cling ﬁlm or in paperboard coating for completely compostable paper
cups. The barrier properties differ from PE: Ecoﬂex
®ﬁlms are breathable because
of their moderate water vapor permeability, which makes such ﬁlms optimallysuited for packaging of food such as fresh vegetables or lettuce.
4.1.2 Ecoﬂex
®FS: A Biodegradable Polyester with New Mechanical
Properties and a High Content of Renewable Resources
Ecoﬂex®FS was commercialized by BASF in 2010 as a compound with poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) (Ecovio®FS; see Sect. 4.2.2 ). Ecoﬂex®FS is an aliphatic–aromatic
polyester with a similar structure to that of Ecoﬂex®F (see Fig. 3). However,
through exchanging one of the monomers with a monomer derived from plant oil,the new Ecoﬂex
®FS is partly based on renewable resources.
Processing and properties of Ecoﬂex®FS are comparable to those of Ecoﬂex®F:
The polyester is melt-processible on standard polyoleﬁn equipment without theneed for predrying and is thermally stable to up to 230
/C14C. It is a ﬂexible and tough
material that is optimally suited for compostable thin ﬁlm applications. Its barrier
properties make it very well suited for packaging fresh vegetables.
Despite its similarity to Ecoﬂex®F, the new Ecoﬂex®FS also shows signiﬁcant
differences that make it the material of choice for certain applications. One of thesebasic properties of Ecoﬂex
®FS is a signiﬁcantly increased rate of biodegradation.
This improves compostability in industrial composting facilities.
Ecoﬂex®FS after production is subsequently further converted to Ecovio®FS
(see Sect. 4.2.2 ).
4.1.3 Production of Ecoﬂex®F and Ecoﬂex®FS
Both Ecoﬂex®grades described in the preceding sections are produced in the BASF
Verbund in a melt polycondensation process. The size of the market for compost-able packaging is increasing at very high rates. To satisfy the high demand forEcoﬂex
®, BASF increased its exisiting production capacity of 14,000 t/annum with
an additional 60 kt polyester plant, which came onstream at the end of 2010.Additional compounding capacity for the production of Ecovio
®(see Sect. 4.2.2 )
was also constructed in 2010.
4.2 Ecoﬂex®: Performance Enabler for Biopolymers
Apart from the pure functional property of a polymer to be biodegradable and thus
to be optimally suited for certain applications, the market very often also requiresEcoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 105
that the biodegradable polymers are also bio-based. Naturally occurring polymers
inherently have the characteristic of being both bio-based and biodegradable.
However, natural polymers like cellulose or starch have mechanical properties
that make them useless for most applications. Also, thermoplastic biopolymerslike polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) or PLA have limitations because of theirproperties.
Blends of polymers from renewable resources with Ecoﬂex
®(see Fig. 4), how-
ever, show very beneﬁcial properties with respect to processability and mechanicalcharacteristics. Thus, Ecoﬂex
®is used as a performance enabler for biopolymers,
making it possible to apply bio-based polymers to a certain extent in applications
for which the pure renewable materials are not suitable.
The two commercially most important Ecoﬂex®/biopolymer blends will be
presented Sects. 4.2.1. and 4.2.2. These are Ecoﬂex®/starch blends (not marketed
by BASF) and Ecoﬂex®/PLA blends (marketed by BASF, Ecovio®).
4.2.1 Ecoﬂex®/Starch Blends
Starch as Raw Material for Plastics
Starch is an inexpensive and abundant renewable raw material. Native starch occurs
in plants as discrete particles (starch granules) and serves as food reserve andenergy source of the plant.
These granules consist of a multilayer structure of two types of distinct
polymers: amylose and amylopectin. They are both polysaccharide compoundscomposed of anhydroglucose units. Amylose is a predominantly linear 1,4- a-
D-
anhydroglucose polymer. Amylopectin consists of anhydroglucose units connected
by 1,4- a-linkages. Branch points are generated by 1,6- a-linkages at selected sites
(see Fig. 5). Amylopectin and amylose together form grain structures that are
partially crystalline because of hydrogen bonds [ 9].
Although the basic chemistry of starches is the same in every plant, the starches
of different plants are different to each other. Potato starch contains about 21% of
Fig. 4 Ecoﬂex as
performance enabler for
different biopolymers106 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
amylose at a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 4,900. Corn starch contains
about 29% of amylose at a much lower Mn of about 900 [ 9]. The polymer
amylopectin forms 70–85% of regular starches at a very high Mn of about2,000,000.
The particle size distribution depends on the type of plant (see Table 5). The size
of the potato starch granules is considerably higher than the size of corn and tapioca
starch granules. Also, the moisture absorption of potato starch is much higher than
for corn and tapioca starch. Thus, processing of tapioca starch in technical pro-cesses like compounding is similar to that of corn starch [ 10].
Pure starch can only be successfully formulated for a limited number of plastic
applications such as foam, e.g., for loose ﬁll. Pure starch ﬁlms and sheets are brittleand moisture-sensitive. They even disintegrate in presence of water. Furthermore,the temperature window for processing is very small because of the limitedtemperature stability of natural starch of about 170–180
/C14C. Chemical modiﬁcation
of starch by partial substitution of hydroxyl groups (e.g., by esters or ethers)
can signiﬁcantly improve hydrophobicity and the rheological properties. Bycrosslinking the starch chains, the stability against acid, heat treatment and shearforce can be improved [ 11]. But still, the high requirements of ﬁlm applications areO O O

not fulﬁlled by modiﬁed starch alone. Compounds with Ecoﬂex®as “enabler” are
the appropriate solution.
Ecoﬂex®/Starch Blends
Blends of starch and a hydrophobic polymer make it possible to overcome the
disadvantages described above. Starch compounds with Ecoﬂex®are used to
enhance hydrophobicity as well as the mechanical and thermal properties ofcompounded products. To obtain high quality ﬁlm products, the starch has to betreated before being blended with Ecoﬂex
®. The crystalline structure of starch
granules has to be destroyed because starch granules are as large as the ﬁlmthickness of typical ﬁlm applications and would therefore reduce the mechanicalproperties of the ﬁlms.
Granular starch can be converted into thermoplastic starch by applying high
shear force, heat, and/or plasticizers (e.g., moisture, glycerol) in a separatecompounding step. Compounding of starch in Ecoﬂex
®can be efﬁciently
performed in a four-stage process:
1. Granular starch is destructurized to thermoplastic starch using temperature,
pressure and plasticizer (e.g., water, glycerol)
2. Ecoﬂex®is added
3. The melt is degassed by an effective vacuum, leaving only a few percent of
moisture in the compound
4. The compound is granulated under water or air and subsequently dried in a
vacuum drier
Film products with good mechanical characteristics are only obtained if thermo-
plastic, plasticized starch has been used. If no plasticizer is used, biodegradablepolymers with limited mechanical properties will be obtained. In this case,coextrusion with the base polyester or another polymer is the way to upgrade themechanical and/or moisture barrier properties (for comparison see Table 6).
Table 6shows that most of the mechanical properties of average low-density PE
(PE-LD) carrier bags from blown ﬁlm (30 mm) are close to the Ecoﬂex
®/starch
compounds containing thermoplastic starch. The reduction in stiffness by 20–25%compared to PE-LD is lower than for Ecoﬂex
®/starch compounds with granular
starch, which amounts to 50–55%. In comparison to PE-LD, compounds ofEcoﬂex
®/thermoplastic starch are stiffer than pure Ecoﬂex®. The reduction in
tensile strength is similar for both starch compounds (10–35%). If granular starchis used, the ﬁlm samples exhibit a rough surface. Thus, printability and mechanical
properties (stiffness and puncture resistance) of Ecoﬂex
®compounds with granular
starch are inferior to Ecoﬂex®/starch compounds with thermoplastic starch by about
30–55%.
Ecoﬂex®is an essential component for the processing of renewable raw
materials like starch and for producing high quality biodegradable and bio-basedplastic ﬁlms out of them. Ecoﬂex
®/thermoplastic starch compounds are used108 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.

because they combine biodegradability and renewable resources. BASF is
providing Ecoﬂex®as enabling polyester to various producers of biodegradable
thermoplastic starch blends.
The condition that the biodegradable “enabling polyester” forms the coherent
phase [ 12] limits the amount of starch and, with this, the amount of renewable
resources of pure Ecoﬂex®/starch blends that can be used for the ﬁnished ﬁlm
products (typically <50%). An increase in the content of renewable resources can
only be achieved by applying (partly) bio-based enabling polyesters (see Sect. 4.1.2
for details of a special grade of Ecoﬂex®– Ecoﬂex®FS).
4.2.2 Ecovio®: Ecoﬂex®/PLA-Blends
Poly(Lactic Acid)
The biodegradable polymer available in the market today in largest amounts is
PLA. PLA is a melt-processible thermoplastic polymer based completely onrenewable resources. The manufacture of PLA includes one fermentation stepfollowed by several chemical transformations. The typical annually renewableraw material source is corn starch, which is broken down to unreﬁned dextrose.This sugar is then subjected to a fermentative transformation to lactic acid (LA).Direct polycondensation of LA is possible, but usually LA is ﬁrst chemicallyconverted to lactide, a cyclic dimer of LA, via a PLA prepolymer. Finally, after
puriﬁcation, lactide is subjected to a ring-opening polymerization to yield PLA
[13–17].
Due to its stereogenic center, lactic acid exists in two enantiomeric forms (
D- and
L-lactic acid), leading to three different lactide stereoisomers ( D-,L- and
mesolactide). Depending on the relative amounts of the different stereoisomers inthe ﬁnal polyester, the crystallinity of the resulting PLA is heavily inﬂuenced andthis way the properties of the polymer can be adjusted to satisfy the needs ofdifferent applications [ 18–20].
Typically, PLA shows properties similar to PS. Its high stiffness and transpar-
ency make it a suitable material for applications like plastic bottles, cups forcold drinks and stiff packages like clamshells. PLA is completely nontoxic andclassiﬁed in the USA as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) [ 21]. Nevertheless,
PLA still suffers from several drawbacks like its low impact strength, its barrierproperties and, especially, its low heat resistance. A lot of research activity iscurrently going on to overcome these drawbacks. More and more companiesoffer solutions to the problems based on masterbatches, on PLA copolymers or
on compounds.
PLA is a compostable plastic material. Chemical hydrolysis is considered to be
the main degradation route for PLA [ 14]. This hydrolysis process takes place at
high humidity and at elevated temperatures (for example in industrial compostingfacilities). The fragments that result from the hydrolysis process, i.e., shortoligomers and monomers, then can be metabolized by microorganisms. Therefore,110 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
PLA articles can be certiﬁed to be compostable under these conditions but will not
degrade in home composting piles due to the fact that temperatures are too low.
Ecovio®: Ecoﬂex®/PLA-Blends
PLA is a transparent, stiff polyester, which can be processed in various ways to
obtain rigid containers like cups, trays, bottles and cutlery. PLA can also betransformed into transparent ﬂexible ﬁlms with properties close to cellophaneusing biaxial orientation technology, and into ﬁbers using the standard productionprocess of ﬁber spinning and subsequent orientation and ﬁxation. But, for mostﬂexible ﬁlm applications (e.g., shopping/organic waste bags) the stiffness of PLA(3,600 MPa) is too high. Therefore, compounds of PLA and soft biodegradablepolyesters like Ecoﬂex
®are used to reduce the stiffness efﬁciently [ 22].
Figure 6shows the stiffness of Ecoﬂex®/PLA blends depending on the PLA
amount. PLA today is a thermoplastic polymer made from renewable raw materialsand is available on industrial scale. Blending the completely different thermoplasticpolyesters – stiff and brittle PLA with soft and ﬂexible Ecoﬂex
®– a whole range of
different material properties can be accessed, depending on the ratio of bothpolymers.
The addition of 20% Ecoﬂex
®in PLA reduces the stiffness of PLA by 25%
(Fig. 6), keeping the impact strength (e.g., Charpy unnotched impact strength at
/C020/C14C, according to ISO 179/1eU) at 22 kJ/m, which is above the level of high
impact polystyrene. Containers produced from this compound are resistant even tosudden strokes and deform without brittle failure at room temperature (23
/C14C).
Flexible ﬁlm applications are much more demanding regarding the stiffness/
toughness ratio of the Ecoﬂex®/PLA compound. Usually, polypropylene with a
stiffness of 1,600 MPa is the stiffest product to be used in blown ﬁlm extrusion. But,

Fig. 6 Stiffness of injection-molded specimen from Ecoﬂex®/PLA compounds with varying PLA
content, according to ISO 527Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 111
most blown ﬁlm lines for stiff products can only handle conventional high-density
PE (PE-HD) with a stiffness of 600–1,200 MPa. Moreover, high requirements haveto be fulﬁlled concerning the bubble stability at lower ﬁlm thicknesses, e.g.,
at 10–15 mm or below.
Co-rotating, intermeshing and self-cleaning twin-screw extruder concepts (e.g.,
from machinery suppliers like Coperion, Clextral, Leistritz, Kraus-Maffei Berstdorfand Extricom) as employed for starch compounds can be modiﬁed for thecompounding of Ecoﬂex
®and PLA. The volume elements for de-airation of starch
powder have to be changed to elements for conveying and melting of granulates.Adapted shear mixing devices are used to blend the melts at low shear energy toavoid high temperatures, which cause pronounced hydrolysis of the PLA phase.
A thorough venting in one or two steps as needed for starch compounds is not
necessary for Ecoﬂex
®/PLA compounds. It is frequently possible to increase the
output rate using Ecoﬂex®/PLA compounds compared to PE-LD.
Good performance characteristics are obtained for Ecoﬂex®/PLA compounds
with Ecoﬂex®as the continuous phase and PLA as the discontinuous phase. An
example is given here for a blend with 45% PLA, (PLA as discontinuous phase,Ecoﬂex
®as continuous phase) and a blend with 60% PLA (PLA as continuous
phase, Ecoﬂex®as discontinuous phase) compared to PE-HD:
Table 7shows that a compound with 45% PLA and Ecoﬂex®can achieve
about 70–75% of the mechanical properties of an average PE-HD carrier bag at30mm thickness. The values of a PE-LD carrier bag (see Table 6) are reached or
exceeded. The 45% PLA compound yields a biodegradable ﬁlm that comes closestto the properties of PE-HD ﬁlms on the market.
The ﬂexibility of Ecoﬂex
®/PLA compounds with Ecoﬂex®as continuous phase
can always be enhanced using Ecoﬂex®in the dryblend. Thus PE-HD-like or PE-
LD-like properties can be achieved using an appropriate combination of Ecoﬂex®
and Ecoﬂex®/PLA compound [ 23].
Another important aspect of biodegradable Ecoﬂex®/PLA blends is their shelf
life under regular storage conditions. Because standard climate is used to conditionplastic specimens prior to testing, standard room climate (23
/C14C, 50% relative
humidity) has been used to store ﬁlm samples from Ecoﬂex®F Film and Ecovio®
F Film (see below). After 3 years of storage under these conditions, biodegradableﬁlms from Ecoﬂex
®F Film achieve or exceed the mechanical properties of PE-LD
carrier bags, except for stiffness. Films from Ecoﬂex®/PLA compounds (e.g.,
Ecovio®F Film) maintain the property level of PE-LD carrier bags during
2 years of storage for stiffness, tensile strength and puncture resistance [ 23].
BASF sells compostable and bio-based Ecoﬂex®/PLA blends under the trade
name Ecovio®. Years of experience with biodegradable plastics and the vast
compounding know-how of BASF has led to Ecovio®, with most optimal mechani-
cal properties and processability that by far exceed the properties of pure dryblendsof the compound partners.
Ecovio
®is used for applications for which its biodegradability offers an added
value to the customer. The following two grades are offered today:112 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.

Ecovio®F Film is a compound made from Ecoﬂex®F and PLA. It is not only
biodegradable but contains high amounts of renewable resources due to thecontained PLA. Ecoﬂex
®is the component in the coherent phase and the compound
is optimized to produce ﬂexible ﬁlms on standard blown ﬁlm equipment. These
ﬁlms exhibit high strength, stiffness and failure energy. They have a high butcontrollable water vapor transmission rate. Ecovio
®F Films are optimally suited
for use as organic waste bags, dual-use shopping bags or knitted nets.
Ecovio®X Foam Packaging is a compound obtained by blending Ecoﬂex®Fa n d
PLA. It is a biodegradable material with high content of renewable resources andshows high stiffness, which is suitable for rigid food packaging applications. Ecovio
®
X Foam Packaging can be foamed on standard foam extrusion lines into foam sheets
and subsequently thermoformed for end applications. The products are suitable for
foamed trays for fresh food packaging applications and are optimally combined in acomplete system solution together with an Ecovio
®FS-derived Cling Film.
In 2009, a special grade of Ecovio®was presented. It is called Ecovio®FS and
contains an increased amount of renewable raw materials. This is due to using anew and bio-based Ecoﬂex grade (Ecoﬂex
®FS, see above), which itself synthesized
from monomers made from annually renewable resources. The following twogrades are offered:
Ecovio
®FS Shrink is a compound of Ecoﬂex®FS with PLA and is predomi-
nantly bio-based. This product can be processed on standard blown ﬁlm equipmentand was optimized for ﬂexible shrink ﬁlm applications to easily wrap packagedgoods like beverage bottles, magazines, books, etc. Unlike PE, Ecovio
®FS Shrink
Film offers a linear shrink behavior, leading to a broader shrinkage window withreduced shrink oven temperatures (30
/C14C lower than for PE-LD shrink ﬁlms) and
thus signiﬁcant energy savings. Ecovio®FS Shrink Film is very strong with a high
failure energy, allowing signiﬁcantly thinner ﬁlm thicknesses than needed for PE
shrink ﬁlms.
Ecovio®FS Paper is also a compound of Ecoﬂex®FS and PLA with a very high
content of renewable resources. This grade was optimized for extrusion coating ofpaperboard. It can be processed on standard PE equipment and shows an excellentadhesion to card board and paper. The Ecovio
®coating forms a barrier for fat
vegetable and mineral oil, liquid and aroma. Applications of choice are compost-able paper cups for hot and cold drinks, freezer boxes or paper wraps for snacks.
All grades of Ecovio
®FS show signiﬁcantly increased rates of biodegradability
because they are compounds based on Ecoﬂex®FS. This leads to improved
performance in industrial composting processes.
4.3 Patent Situation for Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®
Both Ecoﬂex and Ecovio are protected by various patents. The aliphatic–aromaticpolyester PBAT is protected by its composition (EP-B 736557) and chain extensionprocess (EP-B 792309, EP-B 809664, EP-B 809666, EP-B 1074570).114 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
The Ecovio patent portfolio covers the composition of compounds based on all
aliphatic–aromatic polyesters and different compound partners (e.g., PLA) andbranching agents, including different applications (EP-B 1656423, EP-B
1838784, EP-B 1204700, EP-A 2121838).
5 Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Processing and Additives
Ecoﬂex®is designed for processing on regular equipment for standard polymers
like PE. Nevertheless, the equipment has been originally designed according to theproperty proﬁles of such standard polymers. Therefore the following limitationshave to be taken into account if a conversion process is selected:
 Limited compatibility to standard polymers. Ecoﬂex
®is incompatible to stan-
dard polymers like polyoleﬁns, polystyrene and polyvinylchloride (PVC),forming large domains in blends with standard polymers.
 Sensitivity to moisture. Chain cleavage caused by hydrolysis depends on the
moisture level as well as the processing temperature and time. AlthoughEcoﬂex
®itself exhibits adequate hydrolytic stability and can be processed
without the need for predrying in applications like blown ﬁlm extrusion, thismight be different when using different biodegradable polymers like PLA[24–26].
 Reduced thermostability at higher melt temperatures. Ecoﬂex
®is stable without
signiﬁcant change of viscosity until 200/C14C. However, a signiﬁcant change in
melt viscosity is observed at a melt temperature above 230/C14C[25]. Natural
polymers like starch or cellulose become instable at processing temperaturesabove 170–180
/C14C, depending on the processing time. Decomposition and char-
ring occur under these conditions. PLA is thermally sensitive and decomposes attemperatures close to its melting temperature, leading to narrow processingwindows [ 17].
 Low crystallization rate. Biodegradability is related to a low degree of crystal-
linity [ 24,26]. Thus a low crystallization rate enables the converter to control
crystallinity. This is important because the degree of crystallinity also correlates
with the mechanical properties of the ﬁlm.
The most important ways to process Ecoﬂex
®and Ecovio®on standard polyole-
ﬁn equipment are described in Sect. 5.
5.1 Extrusion
Extrusion is a continuous conversion process via melting and subsequent transfor-
mation of granules or powders of biodegradable polymers and additives into semi-ﬁnished or ﬁnished articles like sheets, proﬁles, tubes, bottles, ﬁlms, tapes orEcoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 115
monoﬁlaments (e.g., lines, yarns). The term “extrusion” also refers to compounding
processes, because the same deﬁnition applies to the production of granules byeither cutting strands or directly by underwater pelletizing.
Single-screw extrusion in general is the most important conversion process for
biodegradable plastics. Only injection-molded and injection-stretch blow moldedrigid containers like closures and bottles are not produced by a continuous extrusionprocess.
The common element of extrusion processes is the extruder itself (see Fig. 7).
Thermoplastic biopolymer granules are introduced into the hopper by means ofautomatic dosing equipment. The granules enter the screw at the cooled barrel inlet.In the screw, the material is conveyed, densiﬁed, de-airated and eventually melted
by means of energy dissipation and external barrel heating. Shear and mixing
elements on the screw allow for a good and even temperature distribution in thescrew channel. A vacuum vent, including vacuum pump and air treatment devices,can be installed to reduce effectively the residual moisture content in the melt. Atthe end of the screw, the back pressure from the die needs to be generated [ 27,28].
Basically, Ecoﬂex
®is designed to run on existing extruders for polyoleﬁns,
polystyrene, PVC or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The limitations of

biodegradable polyesters have to be addressed by the selection of an appropriate
extruder:
 Because of the incompatibility of standard polymers to biodegradable polyesters
an appropriate purging procedure has to be developed.
 Because of their sensitivity to moisture biodegradable polymers need to be
processed either in a predryed form or on extruders, which extract volatilecomponents [ 27].
 High shear forces and stagnation zones should be avoided when processing
biodegradable polyesters such as starch compounds because they are sensitiveto thermal degradation [ 12].
5.1.1 Blown Film Extrusion
Mechanical properties of polymers are improved by orientation processes [ 22,
24,29]. Because of the biaxial orientation, ﬁlms from blown ﬁlm lines exhibit,
e.g., a high puncture and tear propagation resistance. Blown ﬁlm lines can bedesigned to produce ﬂexible PE-LD or PE-HD ﬁlms of 5–200 mm.
Ecoﬂex
®ﬁrst was designed as a plastic material for ﬁlm applications. The most
important processing method therefore is blown ﬁlm extrusion (see Fig. 8).
Ecoﬂex®is ﬁrst processed by the extruder forming a melt stream with constant
melt temperature and output rate. The melt is transformed into a parison in the diehead using spiral mandrel-type dies (Fig. 8, 1). The parison leaves the die at or close
to melt temperature. It is cooled down quickly by the air ring and the internal bubblecooling (Fig. 8, 2). The sizing unit allows for an even cooling process of the ﬁlm as
well as ﬁxation of the ﬁlm bubble (Fig. 8, 3). The ratio of the maximum bubble
diameter to the diameter of the die exit yields the blow-up ratio – an important
measure for the biaxial orientation of the ﬁlm.
After the sizing basket, the ﬁlm thickness is determined by the thickness
measuring unit (Fig. 8, 4). The ﬁlm bubble is collapsed to a ﬂat tube in the
collapsing boards, which are typically equipped with aluminum rolls (PE-LD,PE-MD) or wooden bars (PE-HD) (Fig. 8, 5). A reversing unit changes the position
of the ﬁlm in the cross-direction (CD) by turning the ﬁlm continuously (Fig. 8, 6).
The web is split and wound in two ﬂat ﬁlm rolls (Fig. 8, 7). The production process
can be controlled automatically keeping meter weight, thickness distribution and
ﬁlm width constant (Fig. 8, 8). This device enables automatic quality control of the
production process [ 30].
When using Ecoﬂex
®or Ecovio®on standard equipment for PE, speciﬁc
requirements have to be met [ 23]:
 Low melt temperatures, e.g., 140–170/C14C for Ecoﬂex®and Ecoﬂex®/starch
compounds, 165–190/C14C for Ecovio®need to be achieved, which are beneﬁcial
for blown ﬁlm stability and thermal stability.
 Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®run well on extrusion lines for PE-LD. They exhibit a
good bubble stability even at low thicknesses <15mm.Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 117
Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®are weldable on existing bag-making machines for PE-
LD and PE-HD, but at lower welding temperatures of about 90–100/C14C for
Ecoﬂex®. As the crystallization process is slower than with PE-LD, the welding
line can stick to the surface if direct surface contact is possible. Therefore, thewelding machine has to allow for extra cooling of the weld lines [ 23].
Ecoﬂex
®and Ecovio®are also weldable on bag making machines equipped with
parting seam device for simultaneous sealing and parting of the bags at high speed,e.g.,>200 bags/min [ 30].
Production scrap containing Ecoﬂex
®/PLA compound should be handled sepa-
rately from PE-LD scrap. It has been proven that scrap from the dryblend could be
repelletized using an underwater granulator, where the die face is externally water
cooled. The repelletized pellets could be used after drying of the water using a spindryer and, if necessary, a vacuum dryer. Drying conditions have to be adapted to theEcoﬂex
®/PLA compound being used.

5.1.2 Cast Film Extrusion
Cast ﬁlm extrusion of polyoleﬁns has been developed to obtain ﬂexible ﬁlms with a
high level of transparency by freezing the amorphous polymer structure of the melton a chill roll. Cast ﬁlms are mono-oriented in extrusion direction.
The process is divided into ﬁve steps (see Fig. 9): Ecovio
®is ﬁrst processed by
the extruder to form a melt stream with constant melt temperature and output rate(Fig. 9, 1). In the forming section, the melt streams of several extruders can be
merged into one using an adapter feed block or a multilayer die. These devicescontrol the ﬂow of each stream to obtain an even layer distribution (Fig. 9,2 )[ 30].
Then, the melt stream is transformed into a ﬂat ﬁlm in the ﬁlm die. The thicknessdistribution is controlled automatically by means of expansion bolts.
The melt ﬁlm leaves the die at a deﬁned angle to obtain a tangential contact with
the chill roll, maximizing the contact angle with the chill roll and thus the cooling
capacity. Between die exit and the contact line on the chill roll, the ﬁlm is stretchedby a factor of 10–50 within a fraction of a second. The ﬁlm is positioned on the chillroll by static discharge units (Fig. 9, 3). Following the subsequent chill rolls, the
ﬁlm thickness distribution is determined by a thickness measuring unit. If needed,the ﬁlm can be corona-treated using an electrical discharge process to increasesurface tension and thus facilitate printing. In most cases, this procedure is notmandatory for biodegradable polymers because their surface tension is >38 dyn
without corona-treatment (see Sect. 5.1.3 ).

die,4winder, 5automation. (Reproduced with permission from Reifenh €auser)Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 119
The ﬁlm is wound to ﬁlm rolls using a contact/surface winder with an option for
automatic roll change (Fig. 9, 4). The production process can be controlled auto-
matically, keeping meter weight and thickness distribution constant (Fig. 9, 5). This
device enables automatic quality control in the production process.
When using Ecoﬂex®or Ecovio®on standard equipment for PE, speciﬁc
requirements have to be met:
 Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®are processed at lower melt temperatures than standard
plastics: 170/C14C for Ecoﬂex®and 170–190/C14C for Ecovio®.
 A mat chill roll with a high surface roughness should be used to minimize
sticking problems. The chill roll temperature should be kept at about 30–40/C14C
for Ecovio®whereas Ecoﬂex®can be run at lower chill roll temperatures.
 Because of the limited thermal stability of, e.g., Ecoﬂex®/starch compounds,
dead spots in the feed block adapter or the ﬁlm die have to be avoided. As aconsequence, reduction of the ﬁlm width by closing the die with metal bars(deckling) is not recommended for Ecoﬂex
®/starch compounds.
5.1.3 Modiﬁcation of Biodegradable Polyesters Film
AdditivesTo improve processing and performance of ﬁlms made of Ecoﬂex
®or Ecovio®,
ﬁlm qualities can be modiﬁed using additives in the form of master batches
(see Table 8).
Slip agents are used to reduce the coefﬁcient of friction of the ﬁnal ﬁlm as well as
the adhesion of the ﬁlm to metal parts or to itself during processing. Biodegradableamides of fatty acids (e.g., oleamide, erucamide and ethylene-bis-stearylamide),fatty acid esters (e.g., glycerol oleates or glycerolstearates), as well as saponiﬁedfatty acids (e.g., stearates) are typically used as slip agents for biodegradablepolyesters. Such a masterbatch for the processing of Ecoﬂex
®and Ecovio®is
offered by BASF (Ecoﬂex®Batch SL 1).
In order to improve the water vapor barrier property of Ecoﬂex®or Ecovio®,
a wax-based masterbatch can be used. Depending on the concentration, thismasterbatch reduces the water vapor transmission rates of Ecoﬂex
®ﬁlms by up to
Table 8 Masterbatches for Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®

75%. But the transmission level of PE-LD has not been achieved yet (Ecoﬂex®
Batch SL 2) [ 23].
Antiblock agents like talc, chalk or silica can be used in form of masterbatches
[23,25]. The antiblock batches for processing Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®are sold by
BASF under the name Ecoﬂex®Batch AB 1 or AB 3.
Pigment masterbatches can be used to achieve speciﬁc colors in ﬁlm
applications. The use of pigment masterbatches is limited by the requirements onthe heavy metal content by the standards for biodegradability, e.g., EN 13432 [ 31].
Examples for heavy metal-free pigments are carbon black and titanium dioxide.Carbon black pigment is used to make black ﬁlms, which are applied as a mulchﬁlm to increase the soil temperature in spring. Coated titanium dioxide pigments are
used to achieve white ﬁlms, e.g., for carrier bags or for white mulch ﬁlm reﬂecting
infrared radiation to reduce the soil temperature. The maximum loading withtitanium dioxide is limited by the standards that have to be met. Black and whitemasterbatches based on Ecoﬂex are also in the BASF portfolio of biodegradableplastics (Ecoﬂex
®Batch C Black and Ecoﬂex®Batch C White, respectively).
Antifog agents like fatty acid esters are used to avoid the formation of water
droplets on the ﬁlm under condensation conditions, e.g., in cling ﬁlm applications atthe transition from room temperature to a refrigerated warehouse. The antifog agent
is hydrophilic and reduces the surface tension of droplets so that a uniform water
ﬁlm does not impair the clarity of the cling ﬁlm [ 23].
Two examples of its use are given below:
Example 1: Film extrusion on blown ﬁlm line. Antiblock agents like
masterbatches of talc, chalk or silica (e.g., Ecoﬂex
®Batch AB 1) can be used
for Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®. The recommended level is higher than for
polyoleﬁns, e.g., 1–4% of antiblock agent. If Ecovio®compounds are processed,
an antiblock agent in most cases is not needed for Ecovio®F Film and Ecovio®
F Blend, because PLA acts as antiblock agent in higher quantities.
Example 2: Film extrusion on a chill roll line . In order to avoid sticking to the
chill roll of Ecoﬂex®or Ecovio®we have to use an appropriate amount of
antiblock, e.g., at least 1% of Ecoﬂex®Batch AB 1. Slip agent, e.g.,
500–1,000 ppm of erucamide should be used if the ﬁnal ﬁlm properties requirea low coefﬁcient of friction.
Printing
In general, Ecoﬂex
®and Ecovio®can be printed and welded on standard equipment
for PE-LD. Both alcohol-based or water-based inks can be used after testing. Priorto printing, the material has to be corona-treated if the surface tension is below38 dyn. In most cases printing of Ecoﬂex
®and Ecovio®using alcohol-based inks
does not require corona treatment. The drying temperatures should be kept belowEcoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 121
PE-LD conditions. As drying conditions depend very much on the machine design
they need to be determined during a trial [ 23].
Metallization
Biodegradable polymer ﬁlms show low barriers against oxygen and water vapor
due to their chemical nature. Deposition of a thin metal layer under a high vacuumusing a plasma process is one of the most efﬁcient production processes for high
barrier ﬁlms. Slip and antibloc agents in the ﬁlm have to be avoided, because
surface defects reduce the barrier properties of the coating. Both Ecoﬂex
®and
Ecovio®can be metallized on standard equipment [ 32].
Multilayer Film
Film properties of different polymers can also be combined to meet the
requirements of speciﬁc applications.
In the lamination process, ﬁlms of different materials are bonded using heat and/
or biodegradable adhesives [ 23,34]. A metallized ﬁlm (e.g., from PLA) with high
barrier and stiffness can also be laminated on a Ecoﬂex®/starch or Ecovio®com-
pound with good welding performance to produce e.g., a stand pouch for detergents.
A reason for the use of multilayer ﬁlms is to minimize the use of additives.
Surface-active additives like slip, antiblock or antifog agents are used only in theouter layers of a multilayer ﬁlm. The migration of the organic additives and theirsolubility in the polymers has to be considered.
5.1.4 Extrusion Coating
Extrusion coating has been developed to form thin polymer layers on ﬂexible
substrates like paper, paper board and metal foils in a high speed process (see
Fig. 10)[27,33,34]. In combination with paper and paper board, the polymer
protects the substrate from moisture, oil and fat. The polymer provides the weldingproperties to transform, e.g., the paper board/PE substrate into a paper cup, a liquidpackaging board or a box for frozen food.
Ecovio
®is ﬁrst processed by the extruder to form a melt stream with constant
melt temperature and output rate (Fig. 10, 1). In the forming section, the melt
streams of several extruders can be merged into one using an adapter feed block or a
multilayer die. These devices control the ﬂow of each stream to obtain an even layer
distribution [ 27,30]. The melt stream is transformed into a ﬂat ﬁlm in the ﬁlm die.
The thickness distribution is controlled automatically by means of expansion bolts.
The melt ﬁlm leaves the die in a perpendicular direction, entering the gap
between chill roll and ﬁrst downstream roll. The height of the die above the gapshould be minimized to maximize coating width, which is reduced by the neck-ineffect [ 27]. Between die exit and the contact line on the chill roll, the ﬁlm is122 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
stretched by a factor of 10–50 within a fraction of a second. The ﬁlm is positioned
on the chill roll by static discharge units. Following the subsequent chill rolls, theﬁlm thickness distribution is determined by a thickness measuring unit (Fig. 10, 5).
The substrate, e.g., polymer ﬁlm, paper or paper board, is always activated using aplasma treatment (e.g., a ﬂame treatment process) to increase surface tension and
thus improve the adhesion of the polymer.
Instead of the simultaneously extruded polymer ﬁlm, a pre-extruded or
laminated ﬁlm can be laminated on the substrate (e.g., paper or paper board). Inthis case, the extruder can be used to extrude the polymer providing adhesion (e.g.,Ecoﬂex
®) in a thin layer between the polymer coating ﬁlm or laminate and the
substrate. Another option is to apply a dispersion or heat in the laminator (Fig. 10,
4) to obtain adhesion. After thickness measurement and second subsequent coronatreatment, substrate and polymer coating are wound on a winder (Fig. 10,6 )i n
order to obtain rolls for transport to subsequent processes (e.g., printing, cutting,
cup forming, box making).
Ecoﬂex
®and its compounds have a good adhesion to paper and cardboard.
Ecoﬂex®can be processed on existing extrusion coating lines designed for PE at
melt temperatures of 220–240/C14C. BASF offers a special grade of Ecovio®for paper
coating (Ecovio®FS Paper), which can be processed on monolayer and multilayer
coating lines at speeds >300 m/min. Ecovio FS Paper can be used for paper coating

for ﬂexible paper wraps or for rigid packaging, e.g., ice cream boxes, coffee cups
and boxes for frozen food.
5.1.5 Foamed Sheet Extrusion and Thermoforming
Foamed sheet extrusion is a method for producing foam sheets from a solid polymer
by extrusion using blowing agents. Foaming of plastics not only reduces the weight
of the product but also improves the performance for speciﬁc applications. Foamed
sheets are thermoformed to desired shapes for end applications like trays for freshfood packaging and disposable plates for catering services.
Extrusion foaming traditionally consists of tandem foam extrusion systems,
which typically utilize two single screw extruders that are linked together (seeFig.11). In the primary extruder, the polymer is fed into the extruder and melted.
Blowing agent is then injected into the polymer melt, which is homogenized in theextruder. The homogenized polymer melt is then pumped into the secondary
extruder through a small tube connecting the primary and secondary extruder.
The tube consists of a ﬁlter (screen pack) to remove impurities from the polymermelt before entering the secondary extruder. The secondary extruder is a dynamiccooling extruder, which cools the homogenized polymer melt uniformly. Theviscous polymer melt is then pumped into the extrusion die, which is typically anannular die. The melt temperature of the viscous polymer is monitored at the die,which has to be controlled for better foam quality.

The viscous polymer expands via foaming after exiting the extruder through the
extrusion annular die and is stretched over the cooling mandrel. The coolingmandrel is placed next to the annular die to allow the extruded foam sheet to pass
over, forming a tubular foam sheet, and simultaneously help to cool the foam sheet.
After passing over the cooling mandrel, the tubular foam sheet is slit either at thebottom or at the sides to open up into sheets. The foam sheets are passed through theguiding rolls and are then wound into rolls at the winders.
Ecovio
®X Foam Packaging can be processed into foam sheets using a similar
extrusion foaming line. Ecovio®X Foam Packaging, a ready-to-use compound is
fed into the primary extruder, where it is melted by having the primary extrudertemperature set slightly above the melting temperature of the material. Compared to
polystyrene, the melt viscosity of Ecovio
®X Foam Packaging is very high and,
hence, one should expect high pressure in the extruders and the motor load limits tobe easily reached. Traditional blowing agents like hydrocarbons and/or CO
2are
pumped into the primary extruder using suitable feeding methods, where it ishomogenized together with the molten polymer.
The hot polymer melt then enters the secondary extruder after passing through
the small tube ﬁtted with a ﬁlter connecting the two extruders. The hot polymer meltis then cooled uniformly in the secondary extruder by precise control of the
temperatures. The melt shows a lower tendency to shear thinning compared to
polystyrene and hence adequate cooling of the polymer melt is a challenge. Due topoor heat transfer, cooling of Ecovio
®X Foam Packaging in the secondary extruder
needs, on the one hand, lower wall temperatures and, on the other hand, an adequateresidence time. Due to the semicrystalline nature of the material, cold extruderwalls favor the crystallization of the polymer. To prevent the material fromcrystallizing, the temperature of the extruder is increased, which lowers the pres-sure and increases the melt temperature at the die. For optimum foam quality, one
has to ﬁnd the proper balance between the crystallization temperature and the melt
temperature exiting the extrusion die.
Good foam sheet for food packaging is generally considered to have higher closed
cell counts. Lower melt temperature and good melt strength of the polymer are thetwo main factors that determine the uniform closed cell structure of the foam sheet.Sufﬁcient melt strength and appropriate temperature are required to stabilize the cellwalls and prevent the walls from collapsing or breaking during foaming at the dieexit. A closed cell structure improves the mechanical performance of the foam and
also helps in the post-expansion of the foam sheet during thermoforming to achieve
lower density. The extruded foam sheets are generally aged for a couple of days toexchange the gas inside the cells with the atmosphere before thermoforming.
During the thermoforming process (see Fig. 12), the sheet is heated above the
glass transition temperature and below the melting point of the crystalline phase[35]. Afterwards, the hot sheet is formed into a chilled mold using vacuum, pressure
and/or mechanical force. After a cooling step, the thermoformed containers arepunched out and ejected. The skeleton (30–70% of the total volume) is recycled in
the same application (Fig. 12).Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 125
Ecovio®X Foam Packaging foam sheets are generally aged for a couple of days
before thermoforming. They can be thermoformed into desired shapes using thetraditional thermoforming lines. The foam sheets are generally heated up to 123
/C14C
and thermoformed with a cycle time of approximately 30 cycles/min. During thethermoforming process, depending on the closed cell structure of the foam sheets,one could expect post-expansion of up to twice the original thickness of the sheet.
This leads to a reduced density of the ﬁnished articles. The thermoforming can be
done either by vacuum pressure or using mechanical force, depending on the ﬁnalproduct needed. For foam sheets with more open cells, the foam sheets arethermoformed by applying vacuum pressure on both the male and the female partof the mold, thereby stretching the foam sheet to sufﬁcient thickness and density.The thermoformed containers are punched out of the foam sheet and the remainingskeleton of the sheet, which generates scrap of 30–40%, is fed into the recyclingstream. Some examples of thermoformed containers are trays for fresh food pack-
aging and clam shells or disposable plates for catering services.

6.1 Organic Waste Bags
As described above, composting is the most favored method of recovery of post-consumer organic waste. Composting is already well established in some Europeancountries, and is being established in others. The Netherlands and Germany are theleading counties in the development of a composting infrastructure. In these twocountries 95 and 60%, respectively, of all households have access to industrialcomposting plants. In the EU, organic matter accounts for 30–40% of total domesticTable 9 Development of applications of biodegradable polymers

refuse. With the expectation of continuous expansion of the composting infrastruc-
ture, a signiﬁcant growth in the use of organic waste bags is expected.
From a technical point of view, compost bags have to be biodegradable
according to EN 13432. Beyond the mechanical properties it is necessary to
down-gauge the bags at 15–30 mm to achieve a good LCA. At these low thicknesses
it is required that the compost bag can be used in the collection phase at roomtemperature for at least 3–4 days without forming holes because of biodegradationof the bag. The temperature resistance should allow transport and storage at 60
/C14C.
Breathability, i.e., low barrier properties for water and gases, are an advantage.Ecoﬂex
®and Ecovio®fulﬁll these basic requirements for compost bags. Even at
low moisture levels well below 50% relative humidity, the mechanical stability of
Ecoﬂex®F Film and Ecovio®F Film stays intact.
Ecoﬂex®/starch compounds are very versatile regarding their biodegradation
method: They fulﬁll the composting standard EN 13432. Ecoﬂex®acts as an
enabler for starch, providing good processing on blown ﬁlm lines to thicknessesbelow 20 mm and sufﬁcient mechanical properties (e.g., toughness, impact resis-
tance) for compost bags. On its own, starch would form only water-sensitive, brittlesheets without ﬂexibility. Because of the continuous Ecoﬂex
®component, the
temperature resistance of Ecoﬂex®/starch compounds is enhanced to >60/C14C,
providing good stability during storage as well as biowaste collection. Ecoﬂex®/
starch blends on the market can provide good storage stability of the bags even atchanging room climate, e.g., they do not become brittle even if the humidity leveldrops considerably.
Paper is a biodegradable alternative to plastics. Compost bags made of paper are
rather heavy. Pure Kraft paper exhibits a limited resistance to oil and fat, and therough surface limits the printability. But, the acceptance by customers is highbecause paper is perceived as an environmentally friendly material.
6.2 Shopping (Carrier) Bags
Changing consumer behavior, based on higher sensitivity for environmental issuesand an increased interest in environmentally friendly products, accompanied by anincreased interest of retailers to differentiate in the market are the major drivers forthe market growth of biodegradable shopping bags. After shopping, these bags can
be applied for the disposal of organic waste, resulting in a double use of the
material.
Thin biodegradable carrier bags have a property proﬁle that is similar to compost
bags:
 Good mechanical properties for loads of about 1,000 times their own weight
 Good puncture resistance, e.g., for liquid beverage cartons Down-gauging to 10–20 mm
 Good printability (eight color ﬂexo printing) for superior presentation128 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
 Good welding performance for high speed bag-making
 Usefulness as compost bags after several services as a carrier bag
Except for the optical presentation and the resulting need for printability,
biodegradable carrier bags have to fulﬁll very similar requirements to biodegrad-able compost bags.
The speciﬁc material properties (e.g., high puncture resistance) of Ecovio
®F Film
are very suitable for applications like loop-handle shopping bags. Some retailers in
Europe have started to market loop-handle bags based on Ecovio®F Film.
Because of the higher prices of high-end carrier and shopping bags, paper bags
are more often used as shopping bags than as compost bags: But, paper bags withhigh-quality printing and coatings are generally not biodegradable because of thecoating materials applied.
6.3 Mulch Film
Agricultural ﬁlms are a well-established application in Japan and the EU.
This application is very cost-sensitive because of the subsidy structure of the
agricultural sector of the EU. The regulations for waste disposal of mulch ﬁlmrequire either recycling or adequate treatment (e.g., incineration). If thin mulchﬁlms are concerned, the recovery of the ﬁlm in the ﬁeld is crop-dependent and
difﬁcult. Cleaning of the soil residues is cost-intensive. In this case, it can be more
cost-effective to use biodegradable mulch ﬁlm, which is adapted to the climate andthe fruit application.
For example, cucumber is harvested up to 25 times per growing season using
heavy machinery. At the end of the season the mulch ﬁlm is difﬁcult to recover. Forthis application, the use of biodegradable mulch ﬁlm is of interest.
Depending on the crop and the speciﬁc environmental requirements of the region
(e.g., EU compared to Asia), different compounds have to be developed to achieve
these requirements. For example, in Europe more than 8 weeks of intact perfor-
mance of the mulch ﬁlm is required. Limited UV-stability, different degradationspeeds and the different mechanical properties of the individual polymers have tobe considered in the formulation development.
Since the most important property of mulch ﬁlm is the appropriate biodegrad-
ability, extensive experiments in each region are indispensable.
6.4 Horticulture
Different horticultural items made of biodegradable polymers, such as plant pots,seed/fertilizer tape and binding materials, foams and nets for erosion control, offerreduction of system complexity by reducing the number of work steps.Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 129
Ecovio®as modular system allows an adaptation of the material properties to the
requirements of the application, like tapes or nets. Thus, many applications areunder development.
Seed tapes from Ecoﬂex
®have to provide sufﬁcient strength in the sowing or
drilling process, without damaging the seed or germination. Fertilizer tapes have torelease the fertilizer slowly to the roots of the plants. In both cases, Ecoﬂex
®tapes
can provide good strength and slow release performance.
Binding tapes from Ecovio®or Ecoﬂex®exhibit a high ﬂexibility and mechani-
cal strength. Because of the limited UV stability, binding tapes in greenhousesprovide a higher shelf-life than in outdoor applications.
Ground nets for erosion control in constructions below ground level can be
produced using a dryblend of Ecovio
®and Ecoﬂex®F Film to adjust the
orientability and stiffness/toughness ratio of the nets. Carbon black can increasethe UV resistance. The advantage of this Ecovio
®net is that it will degrade in the
course of time. While plants and grass are growing, the roots reinforce the soilstructure preventing a washing-out by the rain. In this critical phase a strong groundnet is needed. After the ﬂora has grown, the ground net is of no use and can degrade.
6.5 Packaging
The packaging market, especially the food packaging market, offers largeopportunities for biodegradable polymers. This will focus on ﬂexible food packag-ing, rigid food packaging and paper coating. For non-food packaging, the exampleof hygiene ﬁlm applications will be described in more detail.
6.5.1 Food Packaging
Flexible Packaging: Shrink Films
Shrink ﬁlms are used to combine several sales items in one packaging, e.g., six
bottles in a six-pack. The bottles are packed in a piece of ﬁlm, which is heated andshrunk in a heating tunnel above the melting point of the ﬁlm for a short time. Theshrink forces after relaxation have to stay high enough to store and carry thepackaged goods along the logistic chain: Thus the requirements are:
 High shrink values in extrusion machine direction (MD) >60%
 Low shrink values in cross-direction (CD) <20%
 High shrink rate during heating in the oven Welding of the loose end during the shrink process High shrink forces after relaxation
For this large market, the biodegradable Ecovio
®FS Shrink Film has been
developed. Ecovio®FS Shrink Film shows good strength and an adequate heat130 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
resistance. Films thereof exhibit the necessary shrink values. A 20 mm Ecovio®FS
Shrink Film shows a equivalent shrink performance and functionality to a 50 mmP E
ﬁlm, leading to materials saving and much better eco-efﬁciency.
Flexible Packaging: Knitted Nets
Knitted nets are produced from blown ﬁlm or specialized extrusion lines with co-
rotating dies. The ﬁlm rolls are slit into small tapes of 2–5 mm width. Then the tapesare stretched on heated rolls (galettes) in several steps to achieve and maintain a
high level of orientation. Typical stretching factors are three to ﬁve times. Thus, the
materiel undergoes a strain-induced crystallization, which maximizes the crystal-linity level in the tape.
Rigid Packaging Containers
Transparent rigid containers account for about 60% of the European market for
rigid packaging. They are best produced using PLA in an extrusion/thermoforming,blow molding or injection blow molding process. If biodegradability is an issue forthe application, it needs to be checked under composting conditions.
Nontransparent containers (e.g., dairy cups) account for the remaining 40% of
the European market. If toughness requirements are not met by PLA, Ecovio
®
compounds can be used for the extrusion of rigid containers. They have an adequateviscosity and can be recycled if the moisture problem is solved by drying the
recycled material (like virgin PLA, to a moisture level below 200 ppm).
PBS and PCL are too soft for rigid containers. Moreover, PCL shows a limited
thermal stability, and PBS still has to prove its suitability for food contact.
Paper Coating
Coated or laminated paper products represent another potential market for biode-
gradable polymers. At present, paper packaging such as disposable cups are extru-sion coated with PE-LD, which restricts the biodegradation of the paper substratesince it acts as an impervious barrier. By using biodegradable polymers,the synergies with the biodegradable paper can be fully explored. Synthetic biode-gradable polymers thus take over the function of the PE-LD and are used to toughenand to protect against fat, moisture and temperature variations. Ecovio
®FS
Paper (for details see above) has been speciﬁcally developed for these paper
applications.Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 131
Extruded Foam Trays
For loose ﬁll applications, foamed biodegradable polymers based on starch have
been used for more than a decade. A new generation of extruded polystyrene (XPS)
biodegradable foams for food packaging applications has been introduced tothe market. NatureWorks is marketing PLA for the use of biodegradable foams.In addition to the foam and an additive, a modiﬁcation of the screws is needed. Theconsortium of PURAC/Synbra/Sulzer is planning on introducing an expandedpolystyrene (EPS) biodegradable foam based on PLA to the market.
The Ecovio
®X Foam Packaging compound is a ready-to-use compound for
existing XPS equipment. No additional modiﬁcations of the screws are needed.
These foams have the potential to replace the foams currently used for food and
protective packaging.
6.5.2 Non-Food Applications
Hygiene ﬁlms have to be soft, permeable, strong and thin:
 Soft ﬁlms comply with the haptics of, e.g., diapers
 Only water vapor permeable ﬁlms are comfortable to wear
 Strong ﬁlms fulﬁll the requirements for high speed processing during assembly
of hygiene products
 Thin ﬁlms comply with the requirements of the LCA as well as reduce cost The ﬁlm has to comply with various regulations concerning skin contact
The state of the art is a combination of linear low-density polyethylene
(PE-LLD) with limestone for diaper back sheets. By biaxial orientation, thebalance of mechanical permeability requirements can be obtained. Because of itsPE-like characteristics Ecoﬂex is a good choice for a biodegradable back sheet.Ecoﬂex provides a good regulatory basis for these applications because of thepositive results of the primary skin irritation test according to OECD 404, as wellas the guinea pig test according to OECD 406.
The modular system, Ecoﬂex
®and Ecovio®, also fulﬁll all the requirements for
the production of other ﬂexible ﬁlm applications like adhesive tapes or disposablegloves, because the ratio of stiffness/ﬂexibility can be adjusted by the Ecoﬂex
®
content. All Ecovio®–Ecoﬂex®combinations can be reduced in ﬁlm thicknesses
down to <10mm.
6.6 Others: Medical Applications
Historically, one of the ﬁrst applications has been the use of biodegradable
polymers for medical purposes. Quantitatively, these applications play a minor132 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.
role in market size, but a major role in health and safety of medical procedures.
Speciﬁc PHAs are used.
Ecovio®compounds are not marketed in these areas.
6.7 Nonbiodegradable Applications: Durable Use
In the last few years, biodegradable polymers like PLA have been established indifferent nonbiodegradable applications. PLA is processed into ﬁbers (e.g., fortextiles) or is used for durable parts in electronics. The driver for these applicationsis the content of renewable materials and not the polymer’s biodegradability.
Since biodegradability is the key value proposition for Ecovio
®, durable
applications are not in the focus.
7 Market Overview and Growth Drivers
Compared to the global market for PE ﬁlm applications (approximately 30,000 kt in
2007), the market for biodegradable polymers (65 kt in 2007; excluding loose ﬁllapplications) represents a small niche segment, which has been established over the
last decade. The competitive advantages and market drivers of biodegradable
polymers in speciﬁc applications are based on:
 Superior lifecycle eco-efﬁciency (e.g., for garden waste bags)
 Changing consumer behavior based on higher sensitivity for environmental
issues and an increased interest in environmentally friendly products
 Increased interest of retailers to differentiate in the market Support by municipal authorities (providing a composting infrastructure) Legislative frameworks to enhance the use of biodegradable products (e.g., in
France, Spain, Italy)
 Technology progress including access to new applications Larger production plants and increasing production capacities
The authors expect the market for biodegradable polymers to grow from 65 kt
(2007) to 400 kt (2015), which means an average annual growth rate of 25%. As thisforecast takes into account not only the potential but also the risks of newtechnologies and markets, it is quite conservative compared to other market studies,
which range from forecasts of 480 to 6,350 kt in 2015 [ 36]. Depending on the
development of the above mentioned factors and technological progress, the marketgrowth for biodegradable polymers may be inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly.
In contrast to fuels and energy, the much lower amount of renewable resources
needed for the production of biodegradable polymers does not lead to a competitionto global food production. As mentioned, according to the authors, the market forbiodegradable polymers will grow to 400 kt in 2015. The volume of corn needed forEcoﬂex®and Ecovio®: Biodegradable, Performance-Enabling Plastics 133
the production of the this amount of biodegradable polymers would equal approxi-
mately 0.1% of the total 700,000 kt of annual global corn harvest [ 37]. This amount
does not inﬂuence the overall volume balance of corn, especially when considering
that other raw materials like sucrose (from sugar cane or beet) or potato starch etc.
can also be used. With the long term perspective of making cellulytic materialsavailable for monomers (e.g., lactic acid) and biodegradable polymers (e.g., PLA,PHA), no correlation to food production is going to exist.
8 Outlook
8.1 General Outlook
Biodegradable polymers are specialty plastics for selected applications, where
biodegradability adds value. The market for biodegradable polymers (65 kt in2007; excluding loose ﬁll applications) represents a small niche segment comparedto the global market for PE ﬁlm (approx. 30,000 kt in 2007) or to the global polymer
market (approx. 250,000 kt in 2007). Based on different market drivers (changing
consumer behavior, improved composting infrastructure, technology, applicationand capacity development) the expected growth rate of approximately 25% p.a. canbe inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly. Biodegradable polymers combine different chemicaland biotechnological steps in their synthesis and degradation and thus are anexcellent example of a symbiosis between these disciplines.
8.2 Outlook for BASF’s Biodegradable Polymers
Ecoﬂex®and Ecovio®
With the increase of production capacity for polyester and other compounds BASF
shows a clear commitment to the growth of the market for biodegradable polymers.Ecoﬂex
®has been established as “the” enabling polyester for renewable raw
materials like starch and PLA in the last decade.
The speciﬁc material properties (e.g., high puncture resistance) of Ecovio®F
Film are very suitable for applications like loop-handle shopping bags. In additionto these ﬁlm applications, Ecovio
®X Foam Packaging gives access to foam-based
food packaging applications.
With the development of the new Ecoﬂex®FS, new performance characteristics
have been achieved in addition to improved biodegradability and bio-based content.This new Ecoﬂex
®FS is used for the development of new Ecovio®compounds for
speciﬁc applications like paper coating and shrink ﬁlm. Further Ecovio®
applications, where biodegradability adds value, are under development to extendthe portfolio of BASF.134 K.O. Siegenthaler et al.

Biodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate)
and Related Polymers
Manfred Amann and Oliver Minge
Abstract This chapter deals with the biodegradability of vinyl ester-based
polymers with a special emphasis on poly(vinyl acetate) and poly(vinyl alcohol).A proper discussion of the importance of the biodegradability of a certain polymerclass cannot be made without understanding the impact that polymer class has onthe environment. Therefore, apart from discussing the actual biodegradationmechanisms, other issues will be addressed. These include, but are not limited to,
how long the class of vinyl ester-based polymers has been known and produced on
an industrial scale, what quantities are produced and released into the environmenteach year, and what applications are addressed with this polymer class. We will alsolook at the general physical and chemical properties of this polymer class and howthese properties can inﬂuence biodegradability. After a discussion of what “biode-gradability” actually means – and what not – the mechanisms for the biodegrada-tion of poly(vinyl ester)s will be discussed in more detail and a summary given ofthe biological systems able to process poly(vinyl ester)s.

1 Introduction to Poly(vinyl ester)s
1.1 History
Poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and its corresponding polymers poly(vinyl alcohol)
(PVA) and poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) have long been known and their historiesof discovery and development are as closely linked as their chemistries, which arecharacterised by an all-carbon polymer backbone and by 1,3-diol structures or theirderivatives (see Fig. 1).
In fact, the ﬁrst description of a polymeric vinyl ester dates back to 1912 when
Klatte [ 1] managed to polymerise vinyl chloroacetate to obtain a solid resin.
However, the potential of these materials was not seen at that time [ 2]. Additionally
the polymerisation reaction faced severe practical problems leading to products

with low molecular masses and mediocre physical properties (please note that the
concepts of polymerisation and macromolecules were not introduced before 1917by Staudinger [ 3,4]).
Soon afterwards, however, Wacker Chemie developed methods for the large
scale production of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) and also overcame syntheticlimitations in the production of PVAc from VAM [ 5,6]. The resulting polymer
PVAc was soon found to be suitable for use both as a binder and as a majorcomponent in adhesives.
The chemistry of PVAc was explored further in the following years: In 1924,
PVA, the hydrolysis product of PVAc, was discovered by Hermann and Haehnel atWacker Chemie in Germany [ 7,8]. At the same time Staudinger independently
discovered PVA [ 9]. After the saponiﬁcation process for PVAc had been optimised,
PVA was inter alia the material to be processed into the ﬁrst fully synthetic ﬁbre
(Synthoﬁl, 1931) [ 10]. PVA also was the ﬁrst fully synthetic stabiliser for colloidal
systems [ 11].
In 1928, PVB, an polyacetal of PVA and butyric aldehyde, was shown to be
suitable for the production of laminated safety glasses [ 12], for which it is still used
today.
In the following decades, homo-, co- and terpolymers of VAM with other vinyl
esters, (meth)acrylates, and ethylene were developed to give thermoplastic
materials with tailored properties that are nowadays produced as solid resins,aqueous dispersions and dispersible powders.
As one can see, PVAc and its related polymers are nothing new and the materials
have been around for almost 100 years. Practical applications of polymers based onVAM have been known for over 80 years and products containing VAc-basedpolymers have been spreading into the environment for just as long.
2 Basic Materials, Production and Producers
2.1 Raw Materials
The synthesis route to vinyl ester-based polymers starting from ethylene is shown in
Fig. 2. The basic monomer for PVAc and its related polymers is VAM. The
worldwide production capacity for VAM was estimated to be close to 5,900 ktonsin 2009 with an actual production of around 5,500 ktons [ 13]. About 50% of the
VAM is converted to PVAc and VAc-containing polymers, and around 30% is
converted to PVA. The remaining 20% is converted in other ways, including the
production of PVB [ 13]. As can be seen from Fig. 2, basically only ethylene and air
are needed for the production of PVAc and its polymer analogous products PVAand PVB.Biodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 139
VAM can be produced starting from ethylene, which is converted to acetic acid
via acetaldehyde by two sequential oxidation steps (reactions 1 and 2 in Fig. 2), the
ﬁrst step being the famous Wacker process (reaction 1 in Fig. 2)[14].
Another way to produce acetic acid is based on a carbonylation of methanol in
the so called Monsanto process, which is the dominant technology for the produc-tion of acetic acid today [ 15]. Acetic acid then is converted to VAM by addition of
ethylene to acetic acid in the gas phase using heterogeneous catalysts usually basedon palladium, cadmium, gold and its alloys (vinylation reaction 3 in Fig. 2)[16]
supported on silica structures.
It should be pointed out that the raw materials for VAM and its related polymers
(i.e. ethylene and acetic acid) are produced from fossil resources, mainly crude oil.
It is possible to completely substitute the feedstock for these raw materials and
switch to ethanol, which can be produced from renewable resources like sugar cane,corn, or preferably straw and other non-food parts of plants. Having that in mind,the whole production of PVAc, that nowadays is based on traditional fossilresources, could be switched to a renewable, sustainable and CO
2-neutral produc-
tion process based on bioethanol, as shown in Fig. 3. If the “vinyl acetate” circle can
be closed by the important steps of biodegradation or hydrolysis and biodegradationof vinyl ester-based polymers back to carbon dioxide, then a truly sustainable
material circle can be established.
2.2 Polymer Production

them being emulsion-, suspension- and solution-polymerisation yielding either
aqueous dispersions or solid resins [ 17]. Depending on the polymerisation method
employed, the PVAc obtained differs in molecular weight and molecular weight
distribution but also in the amount of branching by side reactions. These propertiesare of considerable importance when it comes to biodegradation. As a rule ofthumb, the molecular weight of emulsion-polymerised systems is very high whilesuspension- and solution-polymerised systems usually show relatively low molec-ular masses.
2.3 Polymer Composition
VAM is used to produce a homopolymer and, together with a wide array of differentmonomers, a number of copolymers. Copolymers with ethylene are one of the mostimportant classes of copolymers known and, depending on the ratio of ethylene andvinyl acetate, are abbreviated as EVA (high ethylene and low vinyl acetate content)or VAE (high vinyl acetate and low ethylene content) [ 18] polymers.carbon dioxide

Copolymers with acrylates (vinyl acrylics) or other vinyl esters are also com-
monly produced, mostly as aqueous dispersions. They are, independent of thenature of the comonomer, often referred to as “copolymers” or “terpolymers”.
The presence of comonomers of course heavily inﬂuences a number of physical
properties like the glass transition temperature and melting point, water solubilityor ﬂexibility, to name just a few.
2.4 Derivatives of PVAc
To obtain PVA, PVAc is saponiﬁed in a polymer analogous reaction usingmethanolic sodium hydroxide. The reaction 5 in Fig. 2, which is better described
as a transesteriﬁcation rather than a simple basic hydrolysis, leads to PVAs withdifferent degrees of saponiﬁcation (see Fig. 4).

It is important to note, that neighbouring group effects affect the alkaline
hydrolysis rate of the individual acetate groups. Acetate groups adjacent to alcoholgroups are more readily hydrolysed than acetate groups having only other acetate
groups in close proximity. As a consequence, partially hydrolysed PVA exhibits a
block-like structure rather than a random structure and is best described as a (multi)block PVAc- co-PVA.
The degree of hydrolysis (DH) can be adjusted by the reaction time. Many
common PVA resins have a DH of about 88 mol%. These resins are soluble incold water. Higher DH lead to a reduced water solubility. A totally hydrolysed PVAis almost insoluble in cold water and can only be dissolved by boiling in water foran extended period of time. The insolubility is caused by the build-up of intramo-
lecular hydrogen bonds, leading to a high degree of crystallisation not achieved by
only partly hydrolysed PVA grades.
PVA subsequently can be acetalised (reaction 6 in Fig. 2) with aldehydes, the
most important of them being butyric aldehyde, leading to PVB. However, sincePVB only plays a minor role, both according to the total volume produced and thenumber of applications that make use of PVB, it will not be discussed in much detailin this chapter.
2.5 Manufacturers
The worldwide production of PVAc and its copolymers containing more than 50 wt%of VAM reached about 2,300 ktons by 2007, with an annual growth of about 3.4%[19]. Another major part of the VAM produced is converted to PVA. The major
production regions are the USA, Western Europe, China and Japan.
The major producers of VAM and VAM-based polymers include, but are not
limited to, BP of the UK and Wacker Chemie of Germany. Celanese Chemicals,
Dow Chemical Corp., DuPont and Millenium are important USA-based producers.In Asia, Kuraray, Nippon Gohsei and Showa Denko of Japan; Dairen Chemical andAsian Acetyls of Taiwan; and Shanghai Petrochemical and Sichuan Vinylon Worksof China produce VAM and their polymers. These regions are also the majormarkets for the different products obtained from PVAc and its derivatives.
2.6 Applications
PVAc, PVA and PVB are used in a vast number of different applications [ 19]. The
most common use of PVAc-based dispersions and dispersible polymer powders isin the construction and adhesives industry. The polymeric binders are used asBiodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 143
additives to enhance the properties of e.g. tile adhesives, mortars and self-levelling
compounds. PVAc dispersions are also used in many other adhesive formulations.Wood glues (white glue) are often based on PVAc. It is also commonly used as a
binder in the paper industry and as a binder in latex paints, although binders based
on acrylics are far more common in paint technology. Almost one third of the PVAcproduced goes into binder and adhesive applications.
Because PVAc is approved by the FDA it has also several uses in the food
industry. PVAc can also be found in just about every chewing gum. It is a majorcomponent in the so called gumbase, a mixture of different polymers that incombination with sugar, sweeteners, ﬂavours, and other additives make up achewing gum.
EVA is a copolymer of ethylene with minor amounts (ca. 10–40%) of vinyl
acetate. EVA has many uses as a foam rubber in everyday goods (like shoes etc.), ascable insulation and as encapsulation material in photovoltaic cells.
VAE, a copolymer of vinyl acetate with minor amounts of ethylene is used as an
adhesive for paper, plastics and leather and as a binder for different paints. Shoes,tubes, toys and other articles of daily use also contain VAE polymers. The hydro-lysis product of VAE polymers, EVOH, is a thermoplast and can therefore beprocessed by extrusion and injection moulding and is used as barrier polymer for
O
2and CO 2(e.g. in packaging applications).
PVA is used for example as a water soluble dispersing agent for many different
polymer dispersions used in the construction industry. An important property ofPVA is the ability to redisperse polymer dispersions that have been dried topowders.
PVB, apart from its importance in laminated safety glasses, is also used as an
additive for various printing ink and lacquer formulations because of its ability toform tough and transparent coatings while being compatible with solvents often
used in the printing industry.
As pointed out above, PVAc is frequently not used as a hompolymer but rather
as the major component of a copolymer (VAE, terpolymers, vinylacrylics, etc.).Additionally, in the applications mentioned above PVAc and the related polymersare usually not used alone but as a part of a more or less complex mixture with othercomponents. These components can be, for example, ﬁllers, plasticisers, impactmodiﬁers, compatibilisers, or other polymers. These components need to be takeninto account when discussing biodegradability. They inﬂuence the biodegradability
of the mixture as a whole but they may in particular inﬂuence the biodegradability
of the PVAc moiety by altering the physical circumstances under which degrada-tion reactions can take place.
As mentioned, vinyl ester polymers are used in every part of the world for a vast
number of different applications. They can be found basically everywhere ineveryday life, from housing to personal effects and in goods as well as in food.The environmental fate of poly(vinyl ester)s is therefore of great importance.144 M. Amann and O. Minge
3 Aspects of Degradability
3.1 Chemical Motifs
PVAc, PVA and PVB homopolymers as well as the different copolymers men-
tioned above all have a similar chemical motif in common. They exhibit an all
carbon–carbon single bond backbone, which needs to be broken at some point in a
potential biodegradation mechanism. With respect to the backbone, poly(vinylester)s are closely related to poly(oleﬁn)s, poly(styrene)s and poly(acrylate)s.These three are known not to be biodegradable. Instead, they usually decomposeby the impact of UV radiation, oxidation and hydrolysis reactions, which are notconsidered to be biological degradation.
Apart from the all-carbon backbone, poly(vi nyl ester)s also exhibit a unique 1,3-diol
structure (see Fig. 1). This structure is a common motif in many natural materials,
e.g. carbohydrates. A number of oxidative or reductive electron transfer processes
catalysed by natural redox systems are imaginable for this motif. The 1,3-diolstructure is unique for a synthetic polymer and cannot be found in any othersynthetic polymer class of signiﬁcance. This explains the unusual biodegradationproperties discussed below.
3.2 Physical Properties
Growing public interest in the conservation of an intact environment can beobserved. A general consensus on the fundamental limits in the magnitude andaccessibility of many crucial natural resources is developing in many areasconcerning industrial production. Fewer raw materials and less energy must beused in a future economy.
In the area of chemically synthesised polymers, two approaches can be distin-
guished for reducing their impact on the environment: (1) use of durable materials
that are resistant to attack and can perform for a long period of use, or (2) use ofmaterials that after their projected lifetime easily disintegrate into small molecularcomponents that are compatible with our living environment. Thus, degradability isan aspect of very great concern for all polymeric materials that might ﬁnally end upin the environment.
The classiﬁcation of a polymer as a degradable compound has a very positive
impact on public perception of this chemical, which can still be exceeded by a
classiﬁcation as biodegradable. Not surprisingly there exists a huge variety of ways,
procedures and test protocols to evaluate this aspect of polymer behaviour. Orien-tation in this diversity of methods and related classiﬁcations is not easy and cannotbe fully discussed in this chapter [ 20,21]. The aspects that come into consideration
when dealing with degradability or biodegradation are quite diverse. At the end ofall the different test procedures there is always a classifying attribute given to theBiodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 145
particular polymer. To obtain the right conclusions from this labelling, the speciﬁc
background and context of the evaluations must carefully be kept in mind.
The landscape of testing methods is quite heterogeneous. In discussing the fate
of a polymer like PVA there are different ways of looking at the substance, which
can be found in different test protocols.
The alteration of polymer identity can be followed directly, but other methods
try to look at derivatives originating from the polymer, at oligomeric cleavageproducts, or at small molecules derived therefrom down to CO
2, the ﬁnal product of
mineralisation.
Changes in the speciﬁc properties of the polymer can also be taken as a hint of
some form of degradation. Properties examined include different aspects of physi-
cal behaviour of the polymer, different microscopic images, or changes in simple
parameters such as the total weight of the polymer in the test or an altered molecularmass of the polymer under evaluation.
Changes in the neighbourhood of the polymer under the speciﬁc test conditions
are also accessible parameters that indicate potential degradation processes. Com-mon tests are monitoring of the oxygen consumption or evaluation of the impact onmicrobial growth. The time period of testing is quite crucial. Some methods are runfor only two weeks, but other procedures involve monitoring for many months.
Many different standardised methods (ASTM, OECD, ISO) dealing with
oxygen consumption or biological oxygen demand are compiled in Part I of Eubeleret al. [ 20].
The biological tests offer a wide ﬁeld of parameters that cannot be easily
reproduced. Many microbial strains, microbial communities and biotopes can beused to run speciﬁc tests. Some are well adapted to the polymer under consider-ation, like speciﬁcally engineered microbial strains or indigenous sewage sludgefrom production sites. Other test systems use microbial communities that are not yet
prepared for these compounds, like sludge in municipal sewage treatments. Aerobic
or anaerobic conditions can be maintained, but intermediate or changingoxygenation situations may occur without being monitored. Soil as a degradationmatrix is very complex and not evenly distributed around the Earth. Even identicalsoils differ in their degradation performances quite substantial just by changing thewater content. Water sediments are extremely important, but reproducible handlingis difﬁcult. Much testing is done in compost, which is rich in microbial life, butgreat differences are seen between a backyard heap and artiﬁcial or commercial
systems.
This sophisticated picture is reﬂected by the many test procedures dealing with
degradation or biodegradation that are published by different national, interna-tional, or industry-driven organisations (e.g. ISO, ASTM). The aim of all theseefforts is to obtain comparable data on the behaviour of the polymer under consid-eration, but a driving force is also the marketing need to present an attractiveclassiﬁcation and labelling for the polymer product.
In this chapter, we aim to summarise current knowledge on the biodegradability
of PVA. It is necessary to distinguished precisely between biological mechanisms
and non-biological routes, even if they are intrinsically intimately entangled.146 M. Amann and O. Minge
Abiotic forces will not be in the focus of the discussion, but it is obvious that a
polymeric material like PVAc or PVA exposed to outdoor conditions will undergodifferent alterations at the macroscopic and microscopic scales. Depending on its
interaction with mechanical forces, thermal stress, radiation or chemical attack, the
polymer properties might be changed in a way that is relevant for its interactionwith biological systems.
Mechanical forces like shear or compression in synergy with temperature can
have strong inﬂuence on the material structure upon approaching the glass transi-tion temperature or melting point of the polymer. Irradiation by light might be ofconcern if the surface is amenable, but chemical interactions can hardly be avoidedas all materials display interfaces to different solids, to different solvents like water,
or to atmospheric gases.
Many experimental ﬁndings can at ﬁrst glance be interpreted as some form of
polymer degradation. But, scientiﬁcally valid data must try to make up the balanceof the polymer and its degradation products to avoid false interpretation due toadsorption phenomena, inappropriate analytical tools or detection limits, orchanges in its chemical identity.
Biological mechanisms comprising some kind of disintegration of the polymeric
starting material, its fragmentation (possibly down to mineralisation), and assimi-
lation of polymer-derived substructures into the living organism can be summarised
as a complete biodegradation process [ 22]. In this general sequence organisms act
on polymer substrates not only via classical biological tools like small or largebiogenic molecules to attack the polymer. The living cells or organisms create aliving interface to the polymer that imparts a new physico-chemical environmentfor the polymer degradation. The living nature of the degraders or the complexmicrobial consortia cooperating in degradation results in an intimate link-age ofbiogenic and abiotic factors often working in a synergistic way.
Biodeterioration at the beginning of the biodegradation process works on the
accessible surface of the polymeric material, inﬁltrating porous structures andaltering the macroscopic structure of the polymer. In addition to this physicalprocess, the chemical biodeterioration is a powerful mechanism. Many compoundsproduced by microbial systems are active substances that weaken the polymericstructure. Mineral acids like nitrous acid and sulphuric acid or organic acids likeoxalic, citric or glutaric acid are just a few examples of a huge list of acids producedby different microorganisms operating in this process, often via complexation of
metal cations. Biosurfactants are a further category of supporting agents that
facilitate the interaction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas. Microbial extracel-lular polymers stabilise a water coating on the polymeric materials, causing effectslike polymer swelling or hydrolysis.
Microbial vulnerability of polymers is often ascribed to enzyme activity,
enzymes being crucial players in the biological biodeterioration process. Asenzymes are macromolecular polymers, their attack on the polymer is usuallyonly possible via superﬁcially exposed polymer structures readily accessible via a
microporous structure. Alternatively, the enzymatic attack works indirectly viaBiodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 147
small active mediating molecules like radicals or other active mediators [ 23] that
are generated by appropriate enzyme systems.
Enzymes are the main actors in breaking down the polymers into oligomeric
structures, monomers or other small metabolites. This biofragmentation is a neces-
sary event in the degradation process because the polymer is usually unable to crossthe cell wall or any cytoplasmic membrane of the degrading organisms. Thus,scission of chemical bonds via biological means must be accomplished by thedegraders, if no abiotic involvement has already succeeded.
The biological aim of biodegradation is not to eliminate man-made polymers
from the biosphere but to mobilise densely packed organic material as nutrient formicrobial or higher life forms. This implies that the integration of polymer-derived
atoms into the microbial biomass has to be the last step in true biodegradation. This
assimilation step can ﬁnally end in the observation of cell growth or even acomplete mineralisation via metabolism these intermediates to CO
2. This assimila-
tion can only occur if the polymer can be absorbed in some way by the degrader orcan be broken down to molecules that can be transported via the cell wall andmembrane. In both cases, a metabolically compatible form of the polymer-derivedstructures must be obtained to channel these molecules into the metabolic pathwaysof the degrading organisms. The energy for these vital activities is generated by the
different ways in which organisms are able to gain energy by their catabolic
pathways using different electron transport chains. Reviewing the huge diversityof aerobic or anaerobic life and the many microbes utilising fermentative processes,it is not surprising that degrading organisms are found in quite different biotopes allover the planet.
Biodegradation is a complex natural process covering many parameters that are
often interdependent. The sequence or the simultaneous action of the differentdegrading forces is often highly relevant, which makes it difﬁcult to get reproduc-
ible results. But, it is exactly this complexity that makes it fascinating to illuminate
the interplay of nature with our man-made polymers.
Discussed here is the fate of PVAc and PVA polymers with respect to the
biodegradation events described above. In technical applications and products,additives are used to improve the performance in different processing steps, andblending with other polymers is used to tailor the application proﬁles to thedemands of customers or the needs of the producers. These wanted contaminationsmake it difﬁcult when biodegradation of PVAc- and PVA-containing products must
be used exclusively to evaluate the degradation process. It is obvious that
processing aids, blending partners and other components in an intimate composi-tion containing PVAc and PVA play some role in the multistep biodegradationprocess, either as supporting components or as substances that may slow downbiodegradation or make it even impossible.
Wherever possible we will therefore focus on degradation studies with pure
polymers. The degree of biodegradation of PVAc and PVA depends oncharacteristics that are intrinsically related to the physical and chemical properties
of the polymer. As many of these factors can differ to some extent depending on the148 M. Amann and O. Minge
synthesis and processing of the polymer, a range of polymer products can be
obtained that behave slightly different in biodegradation trials.
3.3 Solubility in Water
Solubility behaviour in aqueous solutions is a crucial factor in many aspects ofbiodegradation because almost all living organisms are dependent on the availabil-ity of sufﬁcient water phase. A low molecular weight PVA molecule shows a good
solubility in water, be it only in molecular amounts or in bulk quantities.
To date, PVA is only accessibly via removal of the acetyl groups from the
precursor polymer PVAc. The highly acetylated polymer is not soluble in water. Bygenerating OH groups via removal of the acetyl residues from the polymer back-bone, the interaction with water solvent molecules becomes more favourable andthe tendency to dissolve in water increases.
Upon further increasing the DH many hydrophilic hydroxyl groups are exposed,
which can additionally form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between
different polymer molecules. These attractive interactions lower the water solubil-
ity of the polymer and give rise to a more crystalline structure of the polymerdomains. Because the glass transition temperature and hardness concomitantlyincrease, degradability becomes more difﬁcult at very high DH.
Due to the neighbourhood of secondary alcohol groups and remaining hydro-
phobic acetyl groups in a not fully hydrolysed polymer, a balanced situation resultsthat dictates the overall water solubility. Temperature plays an important role inthat interplay between the intermolecular attracting forces and the polymer water
interaction. An optimum in cold water solubility can be observed with a DH of
87–89 mol% for molecular weights between 25,000 and 100,000 Da (degree ofpolymerisation, DP, 600–2,400).
In evaluation the biodegradability of PVA, it is necessary to discriminate
between two fundamentally different environmental situations. The fate of PVAcan be analysed by looking at a fully dissolved aqueous PVA found in activatedsludge of an adapted sewage plant or by following PVA molecules in a solid statecompost environment, offering many stabilising interactions with other surfaces of
different origin. High levels of biodegradation of dissolved PVA via microbial
communities can be observed (Tang 2010). Only moderate or marginal biodegra-dation is reported from soil and compost biotopes [ 24].
PVAc is not water soluble, which should be a major obstacle for a potential
biodegradation mechanism. However, PVAc resins show a certain amount ofswelling when exposed to water. This swelling facilitates the degradation bybiologically active substances by making the resin more hydrophilic. Furtherabiotic release of acetic acid residues generates the 1,3 cis-diol motifs in the
polymer backbone, which are relevant as entry points for biodegradation as outlined
further below in Sect. 6.1.Biodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 149
3.4 Molecular Weight
The biodegradation of macromolecules generally comprises a number of steps that
can proceed at different sites from the perspective of the active microorganism. Themacromolecule can be taken up into the cell, where it is cut down and furthermetabolised. Alternatively, the splitting of the macromolecule can be done outsidethe cell, and the small degradation products then transported into the cell.
The cellular uptake of high molecular weight compounds can be accomplished
by engulﬁng those molecules, a mechanism called endocytosis that is widely
distributed because large polar molecules cannot pass through the hydrophobic
environment of a plasma or cell membrane. Alternatively, a speciﬁc cellular uptakemachinery called a superchannel [ 25] is described in a Sphingomonas strain for
polysaccharide macromolecules (27 kDa) like alginate. This kind of transport ismediated by a pit-dependent ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The functionof the transporter is dependent on a pit, a mouth-like organ formed on the cellsurface only when cells are compelled to assimilate this speciﬁc macromolecule.The system allows direct import of intact macromolecules into the cellular cyto-
plasm. Experimental results showing the import of high molecular weight PVA into
microbial cells have not yet been published, but a Sphingomonas strain
(Sphingomonas sp. OT3 [ 26]) is one of the few PVA-degrading microorganisms.
The molecular weight aspects can be discussed for different sites of the degra-
dation topology: the situation outside the cell, at the interface, or inside thecytoplasm of a degrading organism. Two classes can be discriminated in the spatialorganisation of the PVA degradation pathway. Some organisms begin with anextracellular enzymatic depolymerisation via oxidation and hydrolysis, others use
their periplasmatic compartment. This compartment can also be regarded as an
extracellular site, separated by the inner membrane from the cytoplasm, but is bettercontrollable by the organism.
3.5 Extracellular Polymer
Molecular weight and water solubility are related in the case of large PVAmolecules. Perfectly comparable results are not easily available because the DHusually differs to some extent. The fully hydrolysed high molecular weight PVAshows a marginal propensity to biodegrade in soil environments. Many possibilitiesare given to explain that behaviour. The overall rare distribution of degrading
organism is cited but other physical and chemical factors make the degrading
situation very unfavourable. High crystallinity and the strong complexinginteractions of the many hydroxyls with polar mineral components hinder microbialor enzymatic accessibility to the PVA surface [ 27].
Aqueous systems are favourable for the degradation of PVA. Kinetic monitoring
of the molecular weight distribution in liquid cultures of mixed microbial150 M. Amann and O. Minge
populations showed a progressive disappearance of the higher molecular weight
fraction irrespective of the DH (72–98%). In water, fully dissolved polymer iscompletely biodegradable.
As a general mechanism, the degradation of PVA starts outside the cells via
enzymatic attack on the polymer. The resulting products are a mixture of acetoxyhydroxy and hydroxy fatty acids. Upon intracellular enzymatic deacetylation,hydroxy fatty acids are generated that can be further metabolised via the classicalb-oxidation pathway and TCA cycle.
The extracellular enzymatic attack on the 1,3-diol repeating unit in the polymer
proceeds via oxidative enzymes, introducing structures in the PVA backbone thatcan serve as breaking points for subsequently acting enzymes. The enzymatically
introduced 1,3-diketone moieties or b-hydroxy ketone structures are split by
speciﬁc hydrolases or aldolase enzymes. The resulting polymer fragments showthat this enzymatic endocleavage of the polymer is a random process. The reactionis not much affected by the molecular weight of the PVA (DH >80%). This
basic cleavage mechanism is common to all PVA-utilising microorganisms so farstudied [ 28].
3.6 Intracellular Polymer
Organisms of different systematic classiﬁcation are described as PVA degraders.
All candidates show different types of cell walls or membrane systems covering thecytoplasm. The organisms include prokaryotic Gram negative (Periplasm) andGram positive bacteria but also some eukaryotic fungal degraders [ 29]. The mech-
anism of transfer of modiﬁed PVA and PVA-derived fragments across the cyto-
plasm membrane is not clear.
As a result of external extracellular or periplasmic fragmentation, small PVA
oligomers exhibiting residual acetylation (PVA-PVAc) enter the cell. A pro-nounced effect of molecular weight on the fate of these PVA pieces was found.Speciﬁc esterases catalyse the intracellular hydrolysis of residual acetyl groups onnot fully hydrolysed PVA [ 30]. Lower molecular weight species of PVA-PVAc
structures are preferentially accepted as substrates for this activity located in the
cytoplasm and the cytoplasm membrane. The decreasing chain length during PVA
degradation reaches a point where very short segments predominate. Some authorshave discussed a mechanism whereby the residual PVA molecules are degradedstarting from the terminal hydroxyls, in analogy to the b-oxidation of fatty acids.
Those pathways would not necessitate a PVA-speciﬁc biochemical repertoire or aninduction/adaption period for the microorganisms [ 31–33]. It can be concluded that
biodegradation of water-soluble PVA in the extracellular compartment works in abroad molecular weight range of 530–90,000 Da (DP 12–2,000) [ 34]. Inside the
microbial cell smaller fragments are further deacetylated and funnelled into the
standard biochemical degradation pathways.Biodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 151
3.7 Saponiﬁcation
The DH of technical grade PVA varies in the 70–98% range. What the number does
not tell is the distribution of these acetyl groups along the polymer backbone.A uniform statistical distribution or a clustered partitioning on the polymer givesrise not only to changes of the melting behaviour, surface tension or colloidalproperties of the polymer but also to its degradability properties. For good biodeg-radation an intermediate degree of acetylation is necessary, meaning that very highor very low acetylation is unfavourable. Samples with comparable DP differing in
their vinyl acetate monomeric units were synthesised by acetylation of fully
hydrolysed PVA. Biodegradation tests in different media were performed. In solidmedia like soil or compost, a high recalcitrance of fully hydrolysed PVA withrespect to mineralisation was recorded. The same behaviour was monitored withPVA samples with a very low DH, very similar to PVAc. Good biodegradation(50–60%) in soil can be found with a balanced PVA hydrophobicity at DH of24–73 mol%. In aqueous aerobic environments, biodegradation runs parallel withwater solubility [ 35]. Surprisingly, microbial strains showing external esterase
activity were not identiﬁed as superior degraders; esterase was only found as
intracellular activity [ 36,37].
3.8 Stereoregularity
PVA generated from PVAc shows a certain ratio of tacticities distributed over the
polymer backbone. Dominating atactic areas are mixed with isotactic and
syndiotactic segments. Interestingly, the stereo conﬁguration of the vicinalhydroxyls inﬂuences the degradability. Degradation was preferentially observedwith isotactic and syndiotactic moieties, increasing the relative amount of atacticregions [ 31]. The esterases involved in degradation can neither distinguish the
stereoregularity of the polymer nor change it [ 29].
4 PVA Polymer Products
4.1 Blends and Additives
Growing discussion about the limited availability of cheap fossil basic materials,
and customers paying more and more attention to product life cycles, brings aspectsof the biodegradability of polymer products again to the focus of attention. Thereplacement of synthetic polymer products with biopolymers is attractive butlimited because the properties of natural polymers do not always ﬁt the demandsof processability and ﬁnal product performance. PVA with its beneﬁcial rheological152 M. Amann and O. Minge
and ﬁlm-forming properties has been widely used to improve this shortcoming by
the preparation of blends. Several natural polymers of plant or animal origin havebeen used as partner polymers, like the polysaccharides cellulose, starch and chitin;
the proteins silk and gelatine; or the polyaromatic lignin. A broad compilation
covering blends and copolymers is given in [ 38].
The polar PVA shows a perfect dispersibility of cellulose owing to the many
hydrogen bonds that are possible between these two polymers. With high cellulosecontents ( >70%) no crystallinity of PVA could be detected. Cellulose nanoﬁbers
can be used for the production of promising PVA blends but there are no data aboutbiodegradation available yet [ 39]. Polymer blends in the farming and food produc-
tion industry are highly attractive when cheap and readily available materials can be
used. Lignocellulose materials are ideal candidates, as structural properties like
their ﬁbre elements can be incorporated into the polymer matrix. A favourableeffect on biodegradation was not found. Lignin seems to inﬂuence the kinetics ofthe overall degradation scenario but shows no overall positive impact [ 40].
Although lignin is generally regarded as very recalcitrant to biodegradation, theopposite is true for starch. Starch is a polyglucose polysaccharide that has evolvedas a widely distributed biological storage compound that can be easilydepolymerised to generate glucose that is channelled into energy metabolism. Its
poor mechanical properties as a technical material have led to a high number of
blends, amongst others with PVA [ 41]. Polymer compatibility of natural starch and
synthetic PVA is not as good as might be expected between these two highly polarpolymers. Microscopic analysis of the morphology of the composites shows a phaseseparation between a continuous PVA phase with immersed starch islands. Polymerbehaviour and characteristics of PVA starch are described, but the biodegradationbehaviour was not the focus of the published data. The presence of starch cannot beregarded as a positive input to improve PVA biodegradation. In contrast, such
starch blends degrade more slowly than controls without starch, PVA even
inhibited the degradation of the starch from the blend [ 42].
Adding a solid inorganic phase (e.g., particles of Montmorillonite) to such
blends causes biodegradability to become even worse [ 43]. The ﬁndings support a
model of PVA biodegradation that works well in a dissolved state, but isdowngraded upon introducing too many interacting and possibly stabilising forcesfor the PVA polymer into the system.
PVA as an attractive blending partner is used for almost all biopolymers that have
to be tailored in their material properties for special applications. The most abundant
cell wall polymer in the animal kingdom is chitin, a poly( N-acetyl-
D-glucosamine)
polysaccharide commonly found in exoskeletons of arthropods. Chitin has manyuseful properties, such as nontoxicity, lack of odour, biocompatibility and biode-gradability. For solubility reasons it is not chitin but its derivatives that ﬁnd use inmany technical, biomedical or food applications. Chitosan is the most prominentderivative and is produced via deacetylation of chitin. With many otherbiopolymers, many blends were made with different technologies, starting with
simple solution casting techniques [ 44] up to elaborate electrospinning technologiesBiodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 153
[45]. No clear data are given to indicate that these blending partner polymers have a
supporting effect on the PVA biodegradability in the resulting composite material.
Good melting and ﬁlm-forming properties are attractive parameters that make
protein polymers attractive blending partners in many PVA applications. Some
proteins are available in sufﬁcient amounts for technical applications. Gelatine, aproduct made from animal connective tissue, has found entry in different ﬁeldsranging from high value pharmaceutical medical applications, via food to highvolume technical products.
By mixing of aqueous gelatine and PVA solutions, ﬁlms can be obtained that are
usually stabilised by chemical crosslinking. However, microscopy shows the lim-ited compatibility of these two components. Degradation trials with blends
containing different ratios of gelatine and PVA showed no improvement of PVA
biodegradability by the presence of the readily biodegradable protein, but someinhibition of the protein degradation by PVA. Latter could be explained by strongphysical adsorption of PVA on the protein microdomains.
A similar effect is seen in the behaviour of PVA blends with soy protein. This
plant-derived protein is used in many applications that range from food to uses asemulsiﬁers and texturising agents in resins, paints or ﬁbres. Aerobic biodegradationtrials of soy protein/PVA ﬁlms in soil proved that the PVA part imposes negative
effects on biodegradation of these ﬁlms, prolonging their decomposing time. It is
suggested that addition of PVA decreased the ability of soy protein molecules toabsorb water [ 46], thus lowering biodegradability.
The inhibitory effects of PVA can also be found in degradation studies of
polycaprolactones (PCLs). These polyesters can be readily split by lipase enzymesbinding to hydrophobic domains of that linear substrate. PVA/PCL ﬁlms in contrastare not biodegradable by PCL-degrading microorganisms. It can be assumed thatthe surface properties of PCL change upon interaction with PVA in a manner that
enzymatic accessibility of the hydrolysable PCL backbone motifs is decreased.
4.2 Vinyl Alcohol Block Copolymers
Water-soluble polymers are highly attractive candidate molecules in manyapplications. Many of these polymers are not easily biodegradable. Good examples
are polycarboxylates that are widely used as dispersing agents to avoid particleaggregation and to improve the ﬂow characteristics of suspensions. As PVA isknown to be a polymeric chain that can principally be degraded by biologicalmeans, it is quite obvious to introduce PVA sequences into those polymerbackbones. Functional vinyl monomers were copolymerised with vinyl acetatefollowed by saponiﬁcation to obtain poly(carboxylate- co-vinyl alcohol)
copolymers. Using selected PVA-degrading microorganisms, an average block
length of about 5–6 vinyl alcohol units was found to be necessary to obtain
enzymatic cleavage of the copolymer backbone [ 47]. Experiments with pure154 M. Amann and O. Minge
enzymes showed a minimum vinyl alcohol length of 3 diol units, with a preference
for isotactic stereochemistry rather than atactic stereochemistry.
A similar strategy was followed to impart biodegradability to polyacrylates, a
group of polymers we cannot imagine being without in our daily life. The polymer’s
application as superabsorber not only helps diaper management but also aids waterretention in the root area of plantations to retain and deliver limited water resources,especially in arid agricultural areas. PVA was functionalised, copolymerised andcrosslinked with acrylic acid or its partially neutralised form to give crosslinkedpolyacrylates that could swell in water. The three-dimensional acrylic acid vinylalcohol graft copolymer network still retained its swelling properties. Enzymaticdegradation could be easily monitored by the loss of its water-absorbing properties
in vitro [ 48].
Copolymers of ethylene with vinyl alcohol are high volume technical polymer
products. Poly(ethylene- co-vinyl alcohol) (EVOH) is synthesised by hydrolysis of
poly(ethylene- co-vinyl acetate) with an ethylene content of 40–45 mol%. This high
value makes the EVOH almost insoluble in water. In data sheets, EVOH productsare categorised as biologically inert and not biodegradable (e.g. [ 49]). Many efforts
have been made to show biodegradation of EVOH in different biotopes or byapplying enzyme mixtures. Convincing results showing biodegradation of pure
EVOH using radiolabelled [
14C]EVOH samples have not yet been presented, but
hints on some degrading activity in noncrystalline regions are published [ 50].
Blending with a biodegradable biopolymer to readjust such a nonbiodegradablematerial to a bioplastic product classiﬁed as biodegradable has been applied. Thethermoplastic starch blend (e.g. starch/EVOH 60:40; trademark Mater-Bi,Novamont) is a successful example of that strategy. A waterproof bioplastic isobtained by an extrusion process whereby the hydrophilic disperse starch phase isintimately compounded in a continuous hydrophobic EVOH phase. Structural
characteristics of the blends are described in great detail and show that all starches
were destructurised upon the EVOH compounding to generate new interfaces forenzyme-etching treatments. Data on the fate of these mixed phases in the biodegra-dation process have not been disclosed [ 51]. It is not expected that crystalline
EVOH phase residues can be rendered biodegradable by this process. The productshows acceptable biodegradation behaviour for marketing [ 52,53].
4.3 PVA Biodegradation
There is broad consensus that PVA is among the few vinyl polymers that are
principally biodegradable. As already outlined, this rating of PVA is only correct
if certain requirements in structural features are met. Besides the intrinsic polymerparameters, biodegradation is strongly dependent on the surrounding conditionsthat PVA encounters on being released into the environment. Availability ofwater plays a crucial role, as well as the occurrence of biotic or abiotic structuresthan can interact with the polymer surface. In the end, the determining factor forBiodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 155
biodegradation is the existence of microbial organisms that have the repertoire to
modify, hydrolyse, metabolise and ﬁnally assimilate the PVA molecule.
Comprehensive reviews of many aspects of PVA biodegradation are given by
Chiellini [ 37] and Matsumura [ 54] . A more biochemical focus is compiled in a
recent detailed review by Kawai and Hu [ 28]. Here, we will try to give an updated
survey to make orientation in that biological area easier.
5 Microbial Systems
5.1 Organisms and Communities
The search for biodegrading microorganisms does not necessarily have to start in
areas with massive exposure to the polymer compounds. The hunt for microbes can
often very successfully be done in any municipal sewage sludge or backyardcompost heap, as many potent strains that break down polluting substances canbe found all over the planet. However, in contrast to many other polymer-degradingorganisms, the strains that are able to deal with PVA are not easily isolated frombiotopes that have no PVA exposition history. Many examples are available in theliterature that describe successful isolation of those species from PVA pollutedenvironments [ 55]. This general ﬁnding for PVA degraders might be explained
from an evolutionary point of view. PVA as a synthetic polymer entered natural
environments at a late stage of evolution. Microorganisms are not yet prepared touse such resources as a standard carbon source as they do with many other polymersthat show more similarity to naturally occurring counterparts.
A broad taxonomic survey of PVA degraders is not very fruitful as the organisms
known until now that are able to productively deal with PVA cover just a fewfamilies. Among the degrading strains, many species can be found in the genusPseudomonas and Sphingomonas [ 56]. Other genera include Alcaligenes and
Bacillus . Examples of the microbes involved in PVA biodegradation are given in
Table 1.
Besides their occurrence in bacteria, there are also some publications describing
PVA degradation by organisms belonging to the kingdom of fungi. Among them,yeasts represent a prominent group as well as some lignolytic basidiomycetes likePhanerochaete that are known for their capacities in wood rotting and breaking
down of potentially harmful chemicals.
Surveying the PVA-degrading microbial candidates, a broad range from
specialists to generalists is described, which is not uncommon with many other
compounds. The single degraders, microorganisms that can exclusively grow withPVA as carbon source, can be screened quite easily by applying selective enrich-ment conditions. Those candidates were ﬁrst indentiﬁed. Quite interesting is asecond group of degraders, the biodegradation community. A lot of examples areknown where two or even more strains work together to make the PVA source156 M. Amann and O. Minge
accessible and usable as a nutrient (see Table 1and references therein). Symbiotic
pairs can be identiﬁed where each single partner cannot utilise PVA, but coopera-tively they perform well using the PVA polymer for their metabolism.
Different cooperation models are described, but not in all cases are the individ-
ual roles and the molecular factors that each partner contributes or demands clear.In some cases, the partners work together by providing different sets of PVA-degrading enzymes that work both extracellularly and cell-associated on large and
small PVA molecules [ 66]. The predominating symbiotic communities were com-
posed of strains owning a PVA-degrading system and others supplying an essentialcofactor (being themselves unable to grow on PVA). This factor could in somecases be unequivocally identiﬁed as pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a redoxcofactor that plays an essential role in electron transfer capabilities of enzymesand redox chains similar to the widely distributed nicotinamide and ﬂavin systems.In other communities, the mutual dependencies that might possibly also be a cross-feeding system, are not yet fully understood.
Microbial communities dealing with different substrates are stable and success-
ful systems, as they are able to react to different availability of resources. Data onthe further integration of PVA-degrading symbiotic communities in such networksinvolving also PVA blended components and other substrates have not yet beendescribed in detail.
A third group of organisms was studied that are usually regarded as very potent
degraders [ 67]. Wood-rotting fungi have to deal with the most recalcitrant natural
material on the planet and are good candidates for investigation. Though degrada-
tion could be shown by a Phanerochaete fungi using preoxidised PVA [ 68],Table 1 Examples of single cultures and microbial communities (mixed cultures) that show PVA

a substantial role of those fungi as natural degraders is questionable. The sites
where PVA predominantly enters the environment is not densely colonised bywhite-rot fungi. Thus, PVA degradation by these lignolytic strains should be
discussed as an interesting mechanism in an artiﬁcial experimental array and as a
coincidental effect of the natural fungal enzymatic repertoire.
5.2 Aqueous Systems and Composting Sites
Most of the species shown in Table 1were isolated from aqueous sites. Locations
rich in water are exactly those points with extensive PVA release into the environ-ment. Production sites of textile and paper manufacturers were identiﬁed as hotspots of PVA entry into the environment.
Successful biodegradation of dissolved PVA is usually described for aqueous
conditions on sites with a common PVA load. Under aerobic conditions, degrada-
tion rates of PVA and PVA blown ﬁlms comparable to cellulose could be obtained;however, incubation time in adapted sewage sludge was considerably longer [ 69]. It
must be mentioned that microbial degradability is not only a characteristic or aproperty of the organic compound, but also a matter of the conditions encounteredin a speciﬁc degradation environment like a sewage plant. In many cases, thesystem with its requirements determines whether an organic chemical like PVAdegrades or not and how fast the processes proceed. PVA is an outstanding example
showing that terms and conditions are crucial. Quantitative degradation can be seen
in a system of biological wastewater treatment plant and activated sludge with anadapted microbial population, with a low food to microorganism ratio (F/M),constant inﬂux and temperatures above 18
/C14C. In contrast, PVA passes through
the same system largely unchanged given only temporary inﬂux, low input concen-tration (making adaption impossible), a high F/M ratio and temperatures below10
/C14C[70]
Anaerobic trials generally showed poor biodegradation. A preferential degrada-
tion of low molecular weight PVA specimens was found [ 71]. Anaerobic and
aerobic degradation are thought to proceed in very similar biochemical way.Anyway, an anaerobic PVA-degrading microorganism has yet to be isolated.
According to composting and soil trials, biodegradation rates of PVA are worse
for solid PVA products like blown ﬁlms. PVA-based blown ﬁlms were evaluated incompost from urban waste by measuring the percentage of polymer that isconverted to CO
2. Even for long incubation periods, only a very moderate biodeg-
radation was monitored and did not exceed 7%. PVA with a DH of 88% performed
only marginally better than almost complete deacetylated PVA (DH 98%).
PVA ﬁlms buried in soil were tested after 120 days and showed only very limited
signs of biodegradation, and even ﬁeld tests with PVA sheets buried for 2 years indifferent natural soil sites showed only limited (10%) weight loss. No traces ofcolonising microorganisms were detected on the incubated material. Degradablepolymers like poly(hydroxy butyrate), PCL or starch are usually extensively158 M. Amann and O. Minge
covered by degrading microorganisms in such experiments. The low propensity
towards biodegradation can be explained by the general scarcity of microbialdegraders in average soil and the stabilising interaction of different hydrolysed
PVA with soil components like minerals [ 27] or humic acids [ 72].
6 Biochemical Systems
To break up the polymeric structure of PVA, i.e. to disintegrate the large polymer to
more comfortable small sized oligomers that can be transported through the cellularmembranes, and ﬁnally to channel those components into the primary metabolismis the task to be done to complete the biodegradation process. The main tools
available for the degrading organisms are enzymatically active proteins that work
outside and inside of the membrane-enclosed cell. Depending on the structuralorganisation of the species under consideration, additional cell walls andmembranes can complicate this basic situation.
In the literature of PVA biodegradation, the orientation with respect to the
enzymatic activities that are described is not clear-cut and sometimes evenperplexing. This originates in the historical development of the ﬁeld that gaverise to the nomenclature used today. Table 2aims to give a clear denomination of
the enzymes that are directly involved in the biodegradation of PVA, and that are
cited in the literature so far. As an unambiguous denomination for enzyme activity,the Enzyme Commission number (EC number) is used. Every EC number is

be easily found in databases. To get a good overview covering the relevant litera-ture linked with the enzymes, updated databases are a valuable tool. Two examples
are BRENDA, The Comprehensive Enzyme Information System, which compiles a
collection of almost all relevant publications for every enzyme given in Table 2,
and the Universal Protein Database, UniProt http://www.uniprot.org .
6.1 Enzymes
Surveying our present knowledge about the enzyme activities in PVA biodegrada-
tion, a trend toward increasing integration can be seen. There are free enzymesworking in the extracellular space of the cells, including also the periplasmaticvolume, and there are membrane-associated enzymes that are presumably linked to
the cellular cytochrome-based electron transport chains.
Highly speciﬁc enzymes are described as acting on the PVA polymer. The
primary degradation products, after breakage of the polymeric backbone, aresubstrates for enzymes with differing stringencies with respect to the speciﬁcPVA-derived substrate. Finally, cellular enzymes take over, that do not discrimi-nate between the PVA metabolites and similar molecules in the metabolicpathways. In contrast to the PVA-speciﬁc enzymes are those activities that can besummarised as unspeciﬁc degradation enzymes or enzyme mixtures. Those systems
have evolved to break up highly reluctant biological composite materials developed
for stability and longevity and might do a good job in PVA degradation, but are notyet evolutionarily ﬁne-tuned for that target molecule.
The degradation of PVA in bacteria proceeds in basically two steps. The 1,3-diol
moieties in the C–C linked PVA main chain are ﬁrst transformed at many sites bydehydrogenases or oxidase enzymes into a backbone structure containing b-
hydroxy ketone structures or vicinal 1,3-diketone elements. Subsequent chainopening proceeds via speciﬁc hydrolases or aldolase-like enzymes that generate
shorter segments. Acetyl groups still present on the PVA oligomers are removed by
intracellular acetyl esterases delivering acetic acid into the cellular metabolism.The residual molecule can be funnelled into the standard b-oxidation pathway
and serve as building material or is used as an energy source and ﬁnally oxidisedto CO
2.
The speciﬁc oxidative enzymes working on PVA introduce a b-hydroxy ketone
structure into the PVA backbone. Oxygen serves as an electron-accepting moleculethat is reduced on the active site of the oxidase to hydrogen peroxide. These
oxidases are not described in much detail. PVA oxidase (EC 1.1.3.30) and the
secondary-alcohol oxidoreductase (SAO; EC 1.1.3.18) acting on PVA are describedin the databases. In contrast, a secondary-alcohol dehydrogenase (SADH) activityacting on PVA is described that differs in its electron-accepting partner molecule.The dehydrogenase uses NAD as electron acceptor, which is concomitantlytransformed to its reduced state NADH
2. Besides O 2and NAD, a third electron160 M. Amann and O. Minge
acceptor is known among the enzymes described for oxidising the PVA backbone.
This molecule was identiﬁed as pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a small (molecu-lar weight 330 Da) molecule with two adjacent ketogroups in its structure that can
undergo an appropriate redox cycle. PQQ (also known as methoxatin) is a recently
discovered organic molecule and considered by most to be a vitamin because thehuman body cannot produce it on its own. Enzymes using this compound as redoxcofactor are called quinoproteins. A PVA dehydrogenase (PVADH) was found insome bacterial strains ( Pseudomonas ), which could grow on PVA but were deﬁ-
cient in PVA oxidase. The enzyme with its recommended name polyvinyl alcoholdehydrogenase (cytochrome) owns a binding site for PQQ. The PVADH is classi-ﬁed as EC 1.1.2.6., the former classiﬁcation as EC 1.1.99.23 was recently cancelled.
The PVADH is also designated with the systematic name polyvinyl alcohol:
ferricytochrome- coxidoreductase, which reﬂects the observation that the enzy-
matic oxidation of PVA is coupled to the respiratory chain of the microbe via theheme-containing redoxprotein cytochrome c.Such a coupling could not be
observed with PVA oxidases. Although PVADH could be successfully clonedand heterologously expressed [ 75], a non-quino-hemoprotein PVA oxidase has
not yet been cloned [ 76].
The initial oxidative enzymatic transformation of PVA by the enzymes
described above (PVA oxidase, SAO, SADH and PVADH) gives rise to a PVA
backbone with a series of b-hydroxy ketone groups; direct introduction of a vicinal
diketone structure is also described with a different enzyme, PVADH-S [ 54]. The
generation of diketone elements in the PVA chain is catalysed by the same enzymesthat started the oxidative attack. Depending on the organism, the SAO, SADH orPVADH, or combinations thereof, oxidise the b-hydroxy ketone to 1,3-diketone
moieties, which are the breaking points for further degradation (Fig. 5). Besides this
speciﬁc enzymatic transformation via the PVA-speciﬁc oxidase or dehydrogenase
enzymes, a nonspeciﬁc oxidative attack on PVA polymers is also possible.
Oxidative degradation mechanisms with low substrate speciﬁcity are described
for many recalcitrant naturally occurring polymeric substrates. The most difﬁcultsubstrates are found among the lignocellulose composite materials, representing thedominant biomass component on the planet. The two main components, celluloseand lignin, are intimately linked by different kinds of noncovalent and covalentbonds. Both partners are by themselves strong materials requiring specialisedenzyme systems for degradation. Cellulose exists in the form of highly crystalline
phase. In this respect, it shows some similarity with extensively deacetylated PVA.
The activation of cellulose proceeds via specialised enzymes that speciﬁcally bindvia their binding domains to the surface of the cellulose polymer, which is notsoluble in water. Local enzymatic endohydrolysis of single polymer chains bycellulases opens the macroscopic polymer, thereby facilitating further degradationby other specialised enzymes. In addition, fundamentally different mechanisms toattack the crystalline cellulosic structure exist using oxidative enzymes. Oxidativeenzymes are the active species in the degradation of lignin. This polymer has
evolved as a matrix polymer, which imparts durability and strength to the cells.
Thus, it is not surprising that its enzymatic degradation needs a sophisticatedBiodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 161
toolbox. Again, Nature uses oxidases with low substrate speciﬁcity like lignin
peroxidase, manganese peroxidase or laccase to weaken the lignin structures beforeattacking the macromolecule with more speciﬁc enzyme activities.
Such unspeciﬁc oxidative attack is also discussed as a possible route in the
biodegradation fate of PVA. Oxidation of PVA should be possible, as very aggres-sive oxidative species can be generated by the extracellular enzyme mixtures ofwood-rotting fungi. Unspeciﬁc oxidative incidents are to be expected when stronglyoxidising low molecular mediators react with PVA, a mechanism that is described
as the indirect action of laccase enzymes [ 77]. Reports about the beneﬁcialOAc OH OH OH OH OH OAc OH OH

Fig. 5 Enzymatic oxidation of highly hydrolysed PVA proceeds in two steps: 1,3-diol elements in
PVA are oxidised via the b-OH-ketone to form a diketone moiety. Three enzyme systems using
different electron acceptors as cofactors/cosubstrates are shown162 M. Amann and O. Minge
inﬂuence of oxidation on biodegradability of PVA are published [ 78]. Scarce data
are available that show speciﬁc changes in the PVA structure upon contact withwhite-rot fungi like Phanerochaete chrysosporium [79]. A substantial biodegrada-
tion of PVA by wood-rotting fungi has not yet been described.
Chain degradation proceeds at the oxidised sites, where two different routes can
be discerned. One way uses the b-hydroxy ketone functionalities introduced by the
initial enzymatic attack as direct substrates in an aldolase-like scission reaction.The other way proceeds via further oxidation of this structure to a 1,3-diketone,which serves as a target structure for a hydrolase-type splitting enzyme.
The ﬁrst route was found in an Alcaligenes faecalis KK314 strain. The enzyme
that split the PVA on the b-hydroxy ketone element, like an aldolase, was surpris-
ingly found to be identical with the PVADH apoenzyme of the same strain (Apo
PVADH). The identical protein is capable of oxidising (with bound PQQ) andsplitting (without bound PQQ) the PVA chain, depending on its binding state [ 68].
A homologous PVADH enzyme from Pseudomonas did not show this bifunctional
activity of its PQQ-free apoform. As a product of the enzymatic polymer splitting, amethyl ketone-terminated PVA moiety is formed together with an aldehyde-terminated PVA piece that can be easily oxidised to a terminal carbonic acid.
The preferred route for reducing the molecular weight of PVA involves chain
scission at the 1,3-diketone site (see Fig. 6). As the diketone element is chemically
not very stable, a spontaneous degradation of oxidised PVA was also discussed[80]. Nevertheless, the preferred degradation pathway is most likely the biochemi-
cal process because enzymes were identiﬁed that showed high activity withdiketone substrates [ 81], especially with oxidised PVA. The b-diketone hydrolase
(BDH; EC 3.7.1.7) hydrolyses aliphatic b-diketones to form methyl ketones and
carboxylic acids in equimolar amounts [ 82]. The enzymatic cleavage of C–C bonds
inb-diketones is not well studied [ 83]. BDH enzymes could be isolated from
different PVA-degrading strains, puriﬁed, characterised and cloned [ 84].
As enzymatic oxidative transformation of the PVA polymer can act as a multiple
simultaneous event on the polymer with concurrent chain ﬁssion by the appropriateenzymes, the polymer can be broken down into small oligomers that can bechannelled into the primary metabolism. This picture is not complete becausePVA is usually more or less acetylated. The DH is a pivotal factor in almostevery aspect of PVA application. Surprisingly there are very few data dealingwith the enzymes involved in the deacetylation of not fully hydrolysed PVA
polymer. In technical processes, esterase enzymes are widely applied to deal with
PVAc structures. A good example is from the pulp and paper industry [ 85], where
PVAc, a component of “stickies”, is hydrolysed to the less sticky PVA. Esterasesfrom natural sources are known to accept the acetyl residues on the polymer assubstrate but little detailed knowledge exists about the identity of acetyl esterases inthe PVA degradative environment [ 86].
Attempts to identify extracellular esterase activity in PVA-contaminated sites
with proven microbial degradation activity showed no substantial results. The
breakdown of the polymer proceeds without concomitantly high extracellular
esterase activities [ 36]. These ﬁndings suggest that intracellular esterases are theBiodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 163
dominant players in ﬁnally removing the acetate groups, which can easily be
funnelled into the microbial metabolism. Esterases were detected in the cytoplasmof different PVA-degrading organisms, but their activities and speciﬁcities remainto be studied in more detail [ 61]. A clear picture has not yet been presented coveringOAc OH OH O OH OH OAc OH

the interplay of the different activities, but progress especially in the molecular
biology of the PVA degradation pathway will hopefully make one available in thenear future.
6.2 Genes and Genomic Organisation
The availability of advanced methods in molecular biology suggests an easyapproach to any genetic or biochemical question. This statement might be true in
the mainstream of biological research but in the narrow side streets scientiﬁc
progress is demanding and not so fast. Cloning of the enzymatic activities identiﬁedin PVA degradation is highly desirable because DNA sequence information explic-itly alleviates the interpretation of much biochemical data. By comparing thegenetic information of different enzymes one can easily group them in a non-ambiguous system (e.g. by EC classiﬁcation), a task that still has to be completedfor the PVA degradation activities. Sequence analysis can identify homologies ofthe enzymes involved, show the relationships with other known enzymes and give
hints on still unrecognised properties with respect to the single protein or its
possibly coordinated regulation in the interplay with neighbouring activities.
Although PVA degraders do not densely populate all niches of the biosphere, a
few organisms have been isolated from contaminated sites. Enzymes from twoorganisms are described in detail down to the molecular genetic level. Someworkers have analysed PVA degradation genes in Pseudomonas sp. strain
VM15C and another group focused on a different strain, Pseudomonas sp. 113P3,
which was later newly identiﬁed as a Sphingopyxis sp. strain 113P3, again later
reclassiﬁed as a Sphingomonas sp. strain 113P3. Two genes from the degradation
pathway in Pseudomonas sp. strain VM15C could be identiﬁed (see Fig. 7). The
pvaA gene codes for the PVA dehydrogenase, and the pvaB gene encodes for the
oxidised polyvinyl alcohol hydrolase of this strain.

Fig. 7 Genes coding for PVA degradations are organised in an operon structure. The scheme
(simpliﬁed from Kawai [ 70]) shows the situation in two well-studied PVA-degrading strains
(Pseudomonas and Sphingopyxis ). The genetic organisation in other strains has not yet been
examined in such detailBiodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 165
The pvaA gene (coding for a 68 kDa protein, PVADH) shows, besides a signal
sequence, two sites for the binding of redox-active partner molecules, as expectedfrom the biochemical behaviour [ 87]. A PQQ binding area was identiﬁed as well as
a sequence with high homology to known cytochrome cbinding domains. This
latter ﬁnding could unequivocally be demonstrated experimentally by in vitrostudies with recombinant protein (cloning in Escherichia coli ) showing cytochrome
creduction in the presence of PQQ and PVA [ 88]. Upstream of the pvaA gene, the
pvaB gene could be localised encoding oxidised PVA hydrolase [ 89]. This ﬁnding
indicated that pvaA andpvaB constitute an operon in the order pvaBA . The pvaB
gene (encoding for a 41 kDa protein, BDH) shows a lipoprotein signal sequence anda lipase consensus sequence characteristic of the active-site region in serine
hydrolases.
Similar results are published from PVA degradation with Sphingomonas sp.
strain 113P3. In the periplasm of this microorganism, a constitutively expressedoxidised polyvinyl alcohol hydrolase (OPH) and polyvinyl alcohol dehydrogenasewere found [ 76]. Sequence analysis of the ophgene (cloning in E. coli ; 330 amino
acid residues, homodimer with 35 kDa subunits) showed a signal sequence (34amino acid residues) and a serine hydrolase motif similar to those in the pvaB
described above. The two enzymes (from strains 113P3 and VM15C) show a high
degree of homology (63%) but also some minor similarity with polyhydroxy
butyrate depolymerases from different organisms.
Further downstream of the ophgene, a periplasmic PVADH ( pvaA ) was cloned
[69]. The deduced amino acid sequence of the PVADH again showed some
homology with PVADH from Pseudomonas sp. strain VM15C especially with
regard to their conserved superbarrel domain (presumably bearing the PQQ bindingdomain) and their heme binding site. Interestingly, the quinohaemoprotein alcoholdehydrogenase strongly resembles the PVADH, giving rise to speculations about
natural ancestor proteins that have gained changed substrate speciﬁcity by inverting
their domains. This ﬁnding additionally supports the observation of a redox chainthat transfers electrons from PVA via PQQ and cytochrome cin a highly organised
molecular arrangement on the PVADH protein into the respiratory chain. Notsurprisingly, the gene for cytochrome c(a monomeric protein of 16.5 kDa) in
Sphingopyxis sp. strain 113P3 was cloned ( cytC) in proximity to the oph and
pvaA genes [ 90].
The three genes (oph, pvaA, cytC) encoding oxidised PVA hydrolase, PVADH
and cytochrome care expressed constitutively and form an operon. Operon
organisation of speciﬁc pathways is a standard feature of many organisms andenables them to fulﬁl the speciﬁc metabolic challenge in an economic way. Theoperon structure allows coordinated regulation, balanced expression and spatialorganisation with respect to the speciﬁc task, as shown for PVA degradation. Suchgene bundling makes it also possible to transfer the enzymatic set for the completepathway to other organisms, given that a genetic transfer system is available.Mobile genetic elements are one element of the standard repertoire of cells that
contribute to a horizontal gene transfer.166 M. Amann and O. Minge
Sphingomonads have a high capacity to adapt to a new environment and to
degrade wide range of xenobiotics, including synthetic polymers. This high capac-ity is considered to be conferred by a plasmid-borne mechanism, and many
sphingomonads contain large plasmids responsible for xenobiotics like polyethyl-
ene glycol (PEG). Sphingopyxis sp. strain 113P3 was shown to carry megaplasmids
including the pvaoperon [ 91]. Thus, PVA degradation capability can be transferred
to other organisms and can be dispersed in the environment given that appropriateconditions are on hand.
The cloning and study of the genes involved in PVA degradation in these two
strains have very much promoted our understanding of the fate of PVA in theenvironment. However, it must be stated that relevant aspects of the PVA biodeg-
radation metabolism still wait to be resolved with respect to a more detailed
investigation of these two strains and also in the analysis of the many differentorganisms capable of catabolically dealing with PVA. The corresponding genes ofmany enzymes known to be involved have not yet been cloned, like the non-PQQenzymes or the esterases. The genetic analysis could be very helpful in discriminat-ing between the membrane-bound activities and the enzymes working in theextracellular space or the intracellular cell lumen. It is not clear which apparatusis involved in the transport of PVA across the different cell wall or membrane
barriers in the different organisms. The genetic regulation is an open question, both
regarding natural or artiﬁcial triggering molecules [ 92] and regarding the trans-
ducing and sensing structures. Constitutive expression and inducible activities havenot yet been studied on a satisfying level.
7 Conclusion
PVA can generally be regarded as a biologically degradable synthetic polymer.However, real life makes this deﬁnite statement a bit more complicated, as purePVA is in many cases not encountered in its ﬁnal form of application. First, PVA is
generated from the precursor polymer PVAc, a process in which different amounts
and distribution patterns of acetyl groups still remain on the polymer backbone,triggering polymer crystallinity and affecting interaction with water, which isindispensible for biodegradation. Second, PVA is mostly used in blends withdifferent polymeric or low molecular weight partners. Depending on each case,supporting or retarding effects on biodegradation are described or must beexpected. These aspects make it very difﬁcult to compare biodegradation rates ofdifferent PVA products with other polymers classiﬁed as biodegradable [ 93].
PVA is an outstanding example showing that conditions are crucial for biodeg-
radation. Quantitative degradation is described in wastewater treatment plants runwith an activated sludge containing an adapted microbial population; however, thebiodegradation rate decreases signiﬁcantly in systems lacking such a preparedmicrobial population. This must be kept in mind because degrading organisms orcommunities are not evenly distributed in all biotopes.Biodegradability of Poly(vinyl acetate) and Related Polymers 167
Beyond the biological fate of the PVA polymer, the PVA motif is highly
attractive as a polymer degradation insert. PVA blocks in copolymers representpotentially cleavable moieties that can impart breaking points in otherwise highly
reluctant polymeric species.
In contrast to many other polymers classiﬁed as biodegradable, PVA exhibits a
backbone solely made up of carbon. The presence of a heteroatom like O or N in themain chain is deﬁnitely not a prerequisite for Nature to handle a polymeric structurethat does not exist in nature. PVA degradation starts with random oxidations of thepolymer backbone in the extracellular or periplasmic space of some microbes.Speciﬁc enzymes able to detect such sites of ﬁrst attack continue in a hydrolyticway, yielding ever smaller polymer fragments that ﬁnally can be metabolised by the
microbe or the microbial community.
Central key steps are described in the depolymerisation of PVA on the biochem-
ical and genetic level, but further efforts are necessary to completely understand theinterrelated steps in PVA degradation.

Recent Developments in Ring-Opening
Polymerization of Lactones
Philippe Lecomte and Christine Je ´roˆme
Abstract Polylactones are important biodegradable and biocompatible environ-
mentally friendly polyesters widely used for many applications and more particu-larly for biomedical applications. This review covers recent advances dealing withtheir synthesis by ring-opening polymerization (ROP). First, lactones polymerizedby ROP will be reviewed with special attention paid to the effect of the ring size onpolymerizability. Aliphatic polyesters synthesized by the ROP of lactones can also
be obtained by polycondensation. The advantages of ROP compared with polycon-
densation will be highlighted. The second section is devoted to the differentmechanisms used to carry out ROP, such as anionic, coordination, cationic, enzy-matic, and organocatalytic polymerization. Special attention will be paid to thecontrol imparted to the polymerization by the use of catalysts and initiators. Thepolymerization of lactones substituted by functional groups will be shown to affordfunctionalized aliphatic polyesters. The ﬁnal section will focus on the synthesis ofdifferent architectures such as star-shaped, graft, hyperbranched, and macrocyclic
polylactones in the frame of macromolecular engineering.

1 Introduction
Aliphatic polyesters occupy a key position in the ﬁeld of polymer science because
they exhibit the remarkable properties of biodegradability and biocompatibility,which opens up a wide range of applications as environmentally friendlythermoplastics and biomaterials. Three different mechanisms of polymerizationcan be implemented to synthesize aliphatic polyesters: (1) the ring-opening poly-
merization (ROP) of cyclic ketene acetals, (2) the step-growth polymerization of
lactones, and (3) the ROP of lactones (Fig. 1).
The ﬁrst route relies on the ROP of cyclic ketene acetals [ 1–3]. The electron-rich
double bond is prone to react with radicals and electrophiles. Therefore, this class ofmonomers undergoes cationic and radical polymerization. For example, radicalinitiators react with the double bond to provide a new tertiary radical (Fig. 2). Two
distinct mechanisms of polymerization can then take place: direct vinyl polymeri-zation or indirect ring opening of the cycle accompanied by the formation of a new
radical, which is the propagating species (Fig. 2). The ester function is formed

during the ring-opening step. The formation of the C ¼O double bond, approxi-
mately 50 kcal more stable than a C ¼C double bond, and the release of the ring
strain are important driving forces of the reaction [ 2]. The selectivity of the ring
opening versus the vinyl polymerization depends on ring size, substituents, andtemperature. For instance, the radical ROP of the seven-membered ketene acetal2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane yields a 100% ring opening at room temperature [ 4].
Conversely, as far as ﬁve- and six-membered cyclic acetals are concerned, ringopening is generally accompanied by direct vinyl polymerization [ 2]. Nevertheless,
the presence of substituents prone to stabilize the radical formed by ring opening
does not favor direct vinyl polymerization. For instance, 2-methylidene-4-phenyl-1,
3-dioxolane undergoes a 100% ring-opening event even though this monomer is aﬁve-membered cycle [ 2]. Although this approach has been known for a long time,
its development remains limited, most probably due to the low selectivity of thepolymerization and to the difﬁcult synthesis of this class of monomer. Nevertheless,it is worth noting the unusual low crystallinity of aliphatic polyesters synthesized bythe ROP of cyclic ketene acetals due to a high content of branching [ 5,6].
The second approach, i.e., step-growth polymerization, is far more used than the
ROP of cyclic ketene acetals. The step-growth polymerization relies on the esteri-
ﬁcation reaction of diacids and diols or, more directly, on the esteriﬁcation ofhydroxy-acids. A main advantage of this technique is the easy availability of avery wide range of acid and alcohol precursors of aliphatic polyesters. Neverthe-less, this polymerization presents severe limitations. It is mandatory to reachconversion very close to 100% to reach high degrees of polymerization. Theesteriﬁcation reaction has to be carried out at high temperature. Moreover, it isalso difﬁcult to predetermine the molar mass, and it is polydispersity index is quite
broad. Although some important progress has been made, the synthesis of aliphatic
polyesters with a high molar mass is still challenging.
All these limitations were overcome by implementing a third approach based on
the ROP of lactones [ 7,8]. Indeed, many examples of living or/and controlled
polymerization with fast initiation are reported using this technique. High molarmass aliphatic polyesters with low polydispersity indexes can be thus besynthesized. In terms of the availability of the monomers, this approach occupiesI

an intermediate position between step-growth polymerization and ROP of ketene
acetals, and a wide range of polymerizable lactones have been polymerized. Themost typical lactone is e-caprolactone ( eCL), whose the polymerization was
reported in 1934 by Carothers (Fig. 3)[9]. Nowadays, the polymerization of eCL
into poly( e-caprolactone) (PCL) is implemented at the industrial scale. Unlike
polyesters synthesized by ROP of cyclic ketene acetals, PCL is highly semicrystal-line with a melting temperature around 60
/C14C and a glass transition temperature
of/C060/C14C. PCL is commonly used in the polyurethane industry to impart good
water, oil, solvent, and chlorine resistance. PCL is soluble in many organic solventsand is very easily processable. Moreover, PCL is highly biocompatible and isaccordingly used for biomedical applications, as recently reviewed [ 10]. The
degradation of PCL is slow, making it a suitable carrier for long-term drug deliveryapplications [ 11]. Interestingly, PCL is miscible with a set of polymers such as
poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC).
Another interesting example of lactones are the b-hydroxyalkanoates, whose
ROP affords poly( b-hydroxyalkanoate)s (PHAs), a class of aliphatic polyesters
naturally produced by bacteria (Fig. 3)[12,13]. Poly(3-( R)-hydroxybutyrate)
(PHB) is a typical example. PHB is a stiff thermoplastic material with relativelypoor impact strength, but the incorporation of other monomers can improve themechanical properties.
This review aims at reporting on the synthesis of aliphatic polyesters by ROP of
lactones. It is worth noting that lactones include cyclic mono- and diesters. Typicalcyclic diesters are lactide and glycolide, whose polymerizations provide aliphatic
polyesters widely used in the frame of biomedical applications. Nevertheless, this
review will focus on the polymerization of cyclic monoesters. It will be shown thatthe ROP of lactones can take place by various mechanisms. The polymerization canbe initiated by anions, organometallic species, cations, and nucleophiles. It can alsobe catalyzed by Bronsted acids, Lewis acids, enzymes, organic nucleophiles, andbases. The number of processes reported for the ROP of lactones is so huge that it isalmost impossible to describe all of them. In this review, we will focus on the moreOOOO

representative examples and on the more widely used processes. The polymeriza-
tion of unsubstituted lactones will be reported ﬁrst. The last section will deal withthe macromolecular engineering of poly(lactone)s. It will be shown that a wide
range of aliphatic polyesters can be synthesized by the ROP of lactones bearing
substituents, functionalized or not. Finally, special attention will be paid to thesynthesis of aliphatic polyesters with different topologies such as star-shaped, graft,macrocyclic, and crosslinked polyesters.
2 ROP of Unsubstituted Lactones
2.1 Nomenclature
The IUPAC organization proposed a systematic nomenclature for organic
compounds. Nevertheless, this ofﬁcial nomenclature is not very popular in thecase of lactones. The usual names are based on the name of the hydroxyacids asprecursors and the Greek letter refers to the position of the hydroxy group inrelation to the acid group. This letter directly indicates the ring size. For instance,b-lactones are four-membered lactones. The IUPAC and usual names of main
lactones are shown in Table 1. In this review, the usual names will be used for
the sake of simpliﬁcation. Nevertheless, as far as substituted lactones are
concerned, different authors can give different names for a single lactone. When-
ever such confusion is possible, the IUPAC nomenclature will be systematicallypreferred in this chapter, especially in the case of substituted lactones.
2.2 Polymerizability of Lactones
In order to determine whether the ROP of lactones into the corresponding aliphaticpolyesters is possible, thermodynamics have to be taken into account. The ROPfollows the micro-reversibility rule according to (1):

As shown in Table 2, the ROP of lactones is accompanied by a decrease
of entropy ( DSp<0). Accordingly, the polymerization is an enthalpy-driven
process, the negative polymerization enthalpy stemming from the release of the
ring strain during the ring opening. As a rule, high molecular weight polyesters can
thus be synthesized by ROP of four-, six- and seven-membered cyclic esters, aswitnessed by the low equilibrium monomer concentration and the low ceilingtemperature. The polymerization of ﬁve-membered lactones is far more difﬁcult,as shown by the very high ceiling temperature. The main reason for this particularbehavior is the very fast reverse reaction (i.e., the unzipping reaction compared topropagation) and the equilibrium monomer concentration is then very high. TheROP of this monomer was so difﬁcult that some authors even reported that this
polymerization is impossible. This view was nevertheless revised because it was
shown that low molecular weight oligomers can be obtained under suitableconditions and because g-butyrolactone is also able to co-polymerize with other
lactones [ 14].

2.3 Main Mechanisms of Polymerization of Lactones
by Ring Opening
A very broad range of initiators and catalysts are reported in the scientiﬁc literature to
polymerize lactones. The polymerization mechanisms can be roughly divided intoﬁve categories, i.e., anionic polymerization, coordination polymerization, cationicpolymerization, organocatalytic polymerization, and enzymatic polymerization.
2.3.1 Anionic Polymerization
The polymerization of lactones is initiated by nucleophilic metal alkoxides. It is
worth noting that bulky alkoxides are not nucleophilic enough and react as bases.
For example, potassium tert-butoxide deprotonates b-propionolactone and eCL into
new anionic species, which are anionic initiators for the polymerization of lactones[8] (Fig. 4). As a rule, carboxylic salts are less nucleophilic than the corresponding
alkoxides and are, in general, not efﬁcient initiators for the polymerization oflactones. Nevertheless, b-lactones are exceptions because their polymerization
can be initiated by carboxylic salts [ 8].
The more usual mechanism of the anionic ROP of lactones relies on the addition
of alkoxides onto the ester group followed by the cleavage of the acyl–oxygen bond
(Fig. 5).
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that a second mechanism was observed in
the particular case of the ROP of b-lactones. This mechanism takes place by the

scission of the alkyl–oxygen bond into a new carboxylate, as shown in Fig. 6.
Indeed, the polymerization of b-lactones by the ﬁrst mechanism based on the
cleavage of the acyl–oxygen bond is disfavored, which was accounted for by
stereo-electronic effects [ 15].
In order to be living, according to Szwarc a polymerization has to take place
without any transfer and termination reactions [ 16]. All chains remain active during
the polymerization and remain indeﬁnitely able to grow. Under these conditions,the concentration of active species is kept constant once the initiation is over, andﬁrst-order kinetics in monomer is observed. Furthermore, the degree of polymeri-zation is determined by the ratio of the amount of monomer and initiator. Finally,after complete conversion, the addition of a new feed of monomer results in a
quantitative resumption of polymerization. As long as the anionic ROP is carried
out in the absence of protic species, termination reactions are minor events. The lossof control of polymerization is then mainly caused by transfer reactions. Indeed,alkoxides are prone to react not only with the ester function of the cyclic monomerbut also with ester functions present all along the polyester chains, resulting intransesteriﬁcation reactions (Figs. 7and 8). On the one hand, intramolecular
transesteriﬁcation reactions bring about a decrease of the molar mass and resultin the formation of cyclic oligomers (Fig. 7). The extent of the loss of polymeriza-
tion control is quantiﬁed by the selectivity factor b, which is the ratio of the rate of
propagation and the rate of the transfer by intramolecular transesteriﬁcationreactions ( b¼k
p/ktr1). On the other hand, intermolecular transesteriﬁcation

reactions reshufﬂe the length of polyester chains until a polydispersity index of 2 is
reached (Fig. 8). The extent of the loss of polymerization control is quantiﬁed by a
second selectivity factor g, which is the ratio of the rate of propagation and the rate
of transfer by intermolecular transesteriﬁcation reactions ( b¼kp/ktr1).
Control of the molecular parameters can be improved by disfavoring the
transesteriﬁcation reactions. This task is carried out by decreasing the reactivityof the initiator in order to let it react more selectively with the more reactive estergroups of the cyclic monomer and not with the less reactive ester groups along the
chains. The decrease in the reactivity of the alkoxide can be achieved by using both
steric and electronic effects. Indeed, the use of hindered ligands is a tool that allowslower reactivity, better selectivity, and thus better control of the polymerizationto be achieved. Another possibility relies on the use of less electropositive metals.In this respect, a good control of the polymerization was observed using alkoxidesbased on metals with d-orbitals of favorable energy as initiators. This family of
initiators will be discussed in the section dealing with coordination polymerization.
It is worth noting that another transfer reaction to the monomer is reported in the
case of the anionic polymerization of b-lactones, as shown in Fig. 9. This transfer
reaction takes place during the polymerization of b-propionolactone initiated by
carboxylates; even though molar masses up to 10,000 can be reached, even at roomtemperature [ 8]. The situation is even more critical in the case of the polymerization
of substituted b-butyrolactones, as witnessed by a k
p/ktrratio equal to 102, which is
the highest number average degree of polymerization that can be reached underthese conditions [ 8].O O O

2.3.2 Coordination Polymerization
In order to impart a better control of the polymerization, less reactive and thus more
selective organometallic derivatives of metals with d-orbitals of favorable energy
were substituted for anionic initiators [ 17]. The ﬁrst works were carried out by
Teyssie ´and coworkers using bimetallic m-oxo-alkoxides [ 18,19].
Control of the ROP of lactones was improved by using aluminum alkoxides
instead of their anionic counterpart, as witnessed by the increase of the selectivityfactor b, as shown for instance in Table 3in the case of the polymerization of eCL.
The lower reactivity of aluminum alkoxides compared to their anionic counterpartsis shown by the decrease in the rate of propagation of the polymerization ( k
p).
A wide range of aluminum alkoxides can easily be synthesized by the reaction of
alcohols with triethylaluminum. These alcohols can even be substituted by compat-
ible functional groups such as bromides, oleﬁns, and tertiary amines (Fig. 10)
[20,21]. An alternative route towards aluminum alkoxides relies on the reaction
of the alcohols with aluminum isopropoxide in toluene. Isopropanol (iPr) formedduring this reaction is withdrawn by the distillation of the azeotrope made up oftoluene and isopropanol [ 20,21].
Some initiators used for the coordinative ROP of lactones are known to form
aggregates. Aluminum isoporopoxide is a typical example because it is known toexist as a mixture of trimers (A
3) and tetramers (A 4) (Fig. 11). If the polymerization
ofeCL is initiated at 0/C14C by a mixture of A 3and A 4, only A 3is prone to initiate the

polymerization. Under these conditions, the interconversion of A 4into A 3is too
slow compared to the propagation of the polymerization and, accordingly, A 4
remained mostly untouched at the end of the polymerization. It is worth notingthat A
4is slowly incorporated into polyester chains by transesteriﬁcation reactions
with ester functions present all along the chains, even after the end of thepolymerization.
The propagation of the polymerization proceeds according to a coordinatio-
n–insertion mechanism, as shown in Fig. 12. The ﬁrst step relies on the coordination
of the alkoxide (RO-M) to the carbonyl of the monomer followed by the addition of
the nucleophilic alkoxide onto the electrophilic ester function. Thereafter, anelimination step results in the cleavage of the acyl–oxygen bond, the opening ofthe ring, and the formation of a new alkoxide, which is nothing but the propagatingspecies.
Aggregation, already observed during initiation, can also take place during
propagation depending upon the structure of the propagating species. These phe-nomena were evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and kinetic studies. The kinetic
model shown in Fig. 13was proposed by Duda and Penczek [ 22]. The model is
based on several hypotheses. It is assumed that aggregated species are not reactiveenough to react with the lactone and thus to propagate. Conversely, the dissociatedAlO

aggregated species.

Accordingly, the plot of ln ð½k0
p/C138Þversus ln([I] 0) is linear with a slope of 1/ n. The
aggregation state can thus be directly deduced from this plot. For instance, if thepolymerization of eCL is initiated by A
3, the three-arm growing species is an
unimer. Conversely, when the same polymerization is initiated by Et 2AlOR0,
trimeric species are observed [ 21].
In the presence of aggregation, the polymerization cannot be strictly considered
as living, at least according to the original deﬁnition given by Szwarc [ 16], because
aggregation is a transfer reaction. Nevertheless, aggregated species can be consid-
ered as being in a dormant state and can be reactivated into active disaggregatedspecies at any time. Interestingly, control of the molecular weight is maintainedeven though reversible aggregation is present, provided that the aggregationand dissociation rates are high enough compared to propagation.
Later, Kricheldorf and coworkers extended the concept of the aluminum alkox-
ide-initiated ROP of lactones to a set of other metal alkoxides such as tin(IV)[23–25], titanium, and zirconium alkoxides. As a rule, the polymerization takes
place according to the same coordination–insertion mechanism shown in Fig. 12.M

A very wide range of range of initiators and catalysts are reported in the scientiﬁc
literature. Their number is so high that it is practically impossible to describe all ofthem in an exhaustive review [ 17]. Nevertheless, special attention has to be paid to
lanthanide alkoxides because of their higher activity compared to aluminum
alkoxides while maintaining a good control of the polymerization. A very ﬁrstexample was reported by McLain and Drysdale [ 26]. It was shown that yttrium
isopropoxide, which is an oxo alkoxide cluster with the Y
5(O)(OCHMe 2)13stoichi-
ometry, initiated the controlled polymerization of eCL. The polymerization turned
out to be very fast and went to completion within 5 min at room temperature. It wasmentioned that other lanthanides alkoxides (metal ¼Er, Sm, Dy, La) were also
efﬁcient initiators for the same polymerization [ 26]. Shen and coworkers showed
that an increase of steric hindrance of the ligand did not favor transesteriﬁcation
reactions [ 27]. Yasuda and coworkers used SmOEt(C
5Me5)2(OEt 2), [YOMe
(C5H5) 2]2, and YOMe(C 5Me5)2(THF) as lanthanide alkoxides to polymerize eCL
[28]. In 1996, Feijen and coworkers generated yttrium isopropoxide in situ by
reaction of isopropanol and yttrium tris(2,6-di- tert-butylphenolate [ 29,30]. Later,
Je´roˆme and coworkers synthesized in situ yttrium isopropoxide by reaction of
isopropanol with Y[N(SiMe 3)2]3[31,32]. A similar approach was implemented
by Spitz and coworkers, who initiated the polymerization of eCL by Nd(OiPr) 3
obtained from the reaction of isopropanol and Nd[N(SiMe 3)2]3[33]. In 2003, Soum
and coworkers reported a study on the mechanism and kinetics of the polymeriza-tion of eCL by La(OiPr)
3[34]. It is worth noting that the reduction of lactones by
hydrides affords alkoxides able to initiate the propagation of the polymerization.This route was implemented by Guillaume and coworkers, who polymerized eCL
by M(BH
4)3(THF) 3(M¼Nd, La, Sm) into hydroxyl-telechelic PCL [ 35,36]. The
polymerization of eCL by lanthanide alkoxides was extended to other monomers
such as b-propionolactone and d-valerolactone, and was carried out using SmOEt
(C5Me5)2(OEt 2), [YOMe(C 5H5) 2]2, and YOMe(C 5Me5)2(THF) as lanthanide
alkoxides [ 28].
Currently, tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate), also referred as tin octoate, is the
most widely used catalyst for the ROP of lactones. This popularity stems fromits acceptance by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) forthe formulation of polymer coatings in contact with food. Moreover, tin(II)bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) is less sensitivity towards water and other protic impuritiesthan aluminum alkoxides, which facilitates its use in the laboratory and in industry.
The mechanism of the tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate)-mediated ROP of lactones
remained a matter of controversy for many years, and many different mechanismswere proposed. Indeed, tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) is not made up of alkoxidesbut of carboxylates, known as poor initiators for the ROP of lactones. In 1998,Penczek and coworkers made a major contribution in this ﬁeld. They reported that,if the polymerization is carried out in THF at 80
/C14C, then tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate)
is converted in situ into a new tin alkoxide by the reaction with either an alcohol,purposely added in the reaction medium, or with any other protic impurity present
in the polymerization medium (Fig. 14)[37]. Tin alkoxides formed in situ are the
real initiators of the polymerization, which takes place according the usualRecent Developments in Ring-Opening Polymerization of Lactones 185
insertion–coordination mechanism shown in Fig. 12. This mechanism has been
proved by experimental data such as kinetic measurements [ 37,38], analysis of
the chain-ends by MALDI-TOF [ 39], and the inﬂuence of proton trapping agents
[40]. A dynamic equilibrium is established between the dormant alcohol and the
active tin alkoxide. This equilibrium maintains the concentration of propagating tin
alkoxides at a quite low level throughout the polymerization process. Nevertheless,
each chain remains able to propagate and the polymerization is kept under control.Accordingly, the molecular weight of the aliphatic polyester is predetermined by themolar ratio of the monomer to the alcohol. Secondly, the structure of the chain-end iscontrolled. Finally, after the end of the polymerization, the addition of a new feed ofmonomer results in a complete resumption of polymerization. Nevertheless, toohigh a concentration of tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) favors transesteriﬁcationreactions, which limits the control of the polymerization.
Interestingly, salts other than tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) such as scandium
and tin triﬂuoromethanesulfonate [ 41–43], zinc octoate [ 44,45], and aluminum
acetyl acetonate [ 45] were reported to mediate the ROP of lactones. As far as
scandium triﬂuoromethanesulfonate is concerned, the main advantage is theincrease of its Lewis acidity enabling the polymerization to be carried out at lowtemperatures with acceptable kinetics. Later, faster kinetics were obtained byextending the process to scandium triﬂuoromethanesulfonimide [Sc(NTf
2)3] and
scandium nonaﬂuorobutanesulfonimide [Sc(NNf 2)3] and to other rare earth metal
catalysts (metal ¼Tm, Sm, Nd) [ 46].
Although tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) is accepted by the FDA, this catalyst
turned out to be cytotoxic and it implementation to synthesize aliphatic polyestersfor biomedical applications is questionable. It is worth noting that the tin-basedresidues are very difﬁcult to remove from the polyester. Interestingly, Albertssonand coworkers reported an efﬁcient process aiming at reducing the amount ofmetallic remnants left in aliphatic polyesters [ 47]. To this end, after a polymeriza-
tion of eCL initiated by 1-di- n-butyl-1-stanna-2,5-dioxacyclopentane (Fig. 15) goes
to completion, 1,2-ethanedithiol was added to the polymerization medium with
the aim of replacing the Sn–O bonds by more stable Sn–S bonds. The resultingS-containing dibutyltin derivative was more soluble in organic solvents, and thus itwas easier to get rid of tin residues through precipitation. Remarkably, the imple-mentation of this process allowed the preparation of a sample of PCL contaminatedby only 23 ppm of tin residues, which is very close to the limit of 20 ppm imposedby the FDA [ 47].
Coordination ROP can be carried out in bulk and in organic solvents. Particular
attention has to be paid to supercritical carbon dioxide because it is a green,Sn(Oct) 2 + ROH RO-Sn-Oct + Oct-H
RO-Sn-Oct + ROH (RO)2Sn + Oct-H

environmentally friendly medium. A ﬁrst report dealing with the ROP of eCL in
supercritical CO 2was published by Mingotaud and coworkers, but with little
information about possible control [ 48,49]. Later, Je ´roˆme and coworkers observed
that tin(IV) alkoxides are very efﬁcient initiators for the controlled ROP of eCL in
supercritical CO 2[50]. Nevertheless, kinetics of ROP are very slow in supercritical
CO 2, which was accounted for by the reversible reaction of alkoxides and CO 2into
carbonated tin compounds [ 51]. The nature of the metal is important because less
ionic alkoxides have a lesser reactivity towards CO 2[52]. It is worth noting that
PCL is not soluble in supercritical CO 2. In the presence of a suitable surfactant,
nanoparticles were obtained [ 53]. Last but not least, the remarkable “gaslike” mass
transfer properties of supercritical CO 2can be exploited to remove quantitatively
any unconverted monomer and metallic remnants.
The main limitation of the coordination ROP of lactones remains the toxicity of
the metal. For instance, aluminum derivatives are suspected to be involved inAlzheimer’s disease, and tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) is cytotoxic. In order toovercome this drawback, many groups have investigated the replacement of tinand aluminum alkoxides by initiators based on less toxic metals such as magnesium[54,55] and calcium [ 56,57] alkoxides.
Another possible approach relies on the immobilization of the initiator on an
insoluble support. Toward this end, Je ´roˆme and coworkers grafted yttrium
isopropoxide onto a porous silica surface [ 58,59]. Two methods were reported
for the immobilization. The ﬁrst method relies on the reaction of surface hydroxylgroups with an excess of Y[N(SiMe
3)2]3. The silylamido groups immobilized on
the surface were then converted into yttrium alkoxides by the reaction with2-propanol. In the second approach, a yttrium alkoxide was prepared by reactingY[N(SiMe
3)2]3with less than three equivalents of 2-propanol and then grafted onto
the silica surface. Using similar methods, Hamaide and coworkers supported Al, Zr,
Y, Sm, and Nd alkoxides onto silica and alumina [ 60].
2.3.3 Cationic Polymerization
Cationic ROP of lactones has been known for a long time but is not very popular
due to its poor control of the molecular parameters. In 1984, Penczek andcoworkers reported the cationic polymerization of eCL and b-propionolactoneOO

mediated by acylating agents [ 61]. The cationic initiators and catalysts can be
roughly divided in four main families: alkylating agents, acylating agents, Lewisacids, and protonic acids.
Until the middle of the 1980s, it was accepted that the mechanism for the
cationic ROP initiated by alkylating agents was based on the reaction of the cationwith the endocyclic oxygen, followed by cleavage of the acyl–oxygen bond
(Fig. 16).
Nevertheless, in 1984, Penczek [ 62] and Kricheldorf [ 63] revised this mechanism.
If alkylating agents are used as initiators, they proposed that the cation reacts withthe exocyclic oxygen to form the dialkoxycarbocationic species, which reacts furtherby cleavage of the alkyl–oxygen bond as shown in Fig. 17. This mechanism was
clearly proved by the presence of an ester function at the a-chain-end, whereas the
ﬁrst mechanism would result in the presence of an ether function. The propagation ofpolymerization takes then place by reaction of the exocyclic oxygen with the
dioxocarbocation.OO

The mechanism is more complex when acylating agents are used as initiators
because both mechanisms are observed (Fig. 18)[64].
Lewis acids were also screened for the ROP of lactones [ 65]. The polymerization
takes place according to a cationic mechanism provided that the counterionis not too nucleophilic. Conversely, when Lewis acids with a nucleophilic coun-terion are used, several examples are reported where the polymerization takesplace according to the usual coordination–insertion mechanism (Fig. 12). This
coordination–insertion mechanism was indeed reported for the ROP initiated by
ZnCl
2[66], TiCl 4, and AlCl 3[67].
Another approach enabling cationic ROP relies on initiation by nucleophilic
alcohols and amines in the presence of Bronsted acids as catalysts. The mechanismof initiation is based on the activation of lactones by protonation of the exocyclicoxygen, followed by the nucleophilic attack of the alcohol and the scission of theoxygen–acyl bond (Fig. 19). The mechanism of propagation is similar except that
the hydroxyl function at the chain-end is the nucleophilic species. This activationmonomer mechanism is more favorable than the mechanism shown in Fig. 17
owing to the lower nucleophilicity of the exocyclic oxygen of lactones compared
to alcohols. In 2000, Endo and coworkers reported a ﬁrst example of controlledcationic ROP of eCL and d-valerolactone by using an alcohol as an initiator and
HCl.Et
2O as catalyst [ 68]. Nevertheless, the molar mass did not exceed 15,000,
except for poly( d-valerolactone), which has been prepared with molecular weight
up to 50,000 [ 69]. Recently, it was shown that the cationic polymerization ofOO C+O

eCL [ 70] is under control if triﬂuoromethanesulfonic is used as a catalyst. Molar
masses up to 20,000 were obtained. Later, Bourrissou showed that triﬂuorometha-nesulfonic acid can be replaced by the less acidic methanesulfonic acid [ 71].
Kakuchi and coworkers reported the polymerization of d-valerolactone using
3-phenyl-1-propanol as the initiator and triﬂuoromethanesulfonimide as the catalyst
in CH
2Cl2at 27/C14C[72]. Interestingly, the polymerization was under control and
various functionalized alcohols were used as initiators. Very recently, Takasu andcoworkers extended this strategy to other perﬂuoroalkanesulfonates and perﬂuor-oalkanesulfonimides to perform fast ROP [ 73]. As far as eCL is concerned, the
fastest polymerization was obtained by using nonaﬂuorobutanesulfonimide as acatalyst.
Organic compounds such as lactic acid [ 74,75], citric acid [ 74], fumaric acid
[76,77], and amino acids [ 74] were also shown to catalyze the ROP of lactones,
using alcohols and amines as initiators. Interestingly, an acid catalyst can be
supported on a solid support such as porous silica [ 78]. Unfortunately, the
polymerization is slow and reuse of the catalyst after its recovery and regenera-tion turned out to be unsuccessful. Finally, it is worth noting the particularbehavior of amino acids, which are able to both catalyze and initiate the ROPof lactones [ 79].
2.3.4 Organocatalytic Polymerization
Many researchers have investigated the use of amines and alcohols as initiators for
the ROP of lactones. As a rule, amines and alcohols are not nucleophilic enough tobe efﬁcient initiators, and it is then mandatory to use catalysts to perform thepolymerization successfully. Nevertheless, highly reactive b-lactones exhibit a
particular behavior because their polymerization can be initiated by nucleophilicamines in the absence of any catalyst. As far as tertiary amines are concerned, the
initiation step implies the formation of a zwitterion made up of an ammonium
cation and a carboxylate anion, as shown in Fig. 20. Authors coined the name
“zwitterionic polymerization” for this process [ 80]. Nevertheless, this polymerization
is not really new because the mechanism is mainly anionic. Interestingly, Kricheldorfand coworkers did not exclude the possibility that, at least at some stage of thepolymerization, chain extension takes place by step-growth polycondensation [ 81].OO

initiated by nucleophilic alcohols190 P. Lecomte and C. Je ´roˆme
The same authors did not observe intramolecular cyclization by the coupling reaction
of the ammonium cation and the carboxylate anion, at least in their work [ 81]. The
presence of elimination reactions of the ammonium salt should not be ruled out, atleast at high temperatures.
For less reactive lactones, the initiation and propagation of the polymerization
require a catalyst. Two strategies can be implemented: the catalysts can activateeither the initiator or the monomer. Interestingly, dual catalysts can associate bothmechanisms of activation. Some signiﬁcant advances have been made in the last
few years, especially under the impulse of the group of Hedrick, as recently
reviewed [ 82,83].
The activation of lactones by Bronsted acids was discussed in the section 2.3.3
dealing with cationic polymerization. An alternative relies on the use of nucleo-philic species for the activation of lactones (Fig. 21).
N-Heterocyclic carbenes are an example of a family of nucleophilic catalysts
[84–87]. For instance, the polymerization of b-butyrolactone was catalyzed by
1,3,4-triphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1 H,1,2-triazol-5-ylidene in the presence of methanol
as an initiator [ 86]. This reaction was carried out in toluene at 80
/C14C. Nevertheless,
an undesired elimination (Fig. 4) reaction was observed and control of the poly-
merization was lost. This issue was overcome by using tert-butanol as a co-solvent,
which reacts reversibly with the free carbene to form a new adduct. Owing to thedecrease in the concentration of the free carbene, the elimination is disfavored andthe polymerization is then under control provided that a degree of polymerizationbelow 200 is targeted. As a rule, the reactivity of N-heterocyclic carbenesdepends on their substituents. Hindered N-heterocyclic carbenes turned out to be
not nucleophilic enough for the ROP of eCL. Recently, it was shown that unen-
cumbered N-heterocyclic carbenes were more efﬁcient catalysts [ 87].
1,5,7-Triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) is another efﬁcient organocatalyst
for the ROP of lactones initiated by alcohols [ 88,89]. Indeed, the polymerization ofOO

eCL and d-valerolactone was successfully carried out, and the corresponding
polyesters were obtained with predictable degrees of polymerization of up to 200and low polydispersities ( <1.16). Interestingly, Hedrick and coworkers proposed a
mechanism based on the dual activation of both the monomer and the initiatoraccording to Fig. 22. It is worth noting that b-butyrolactone did not polymerize in
the presence of this catalyst.
When 1,8-diaza[5.4.0]bicycloundec-7-ene (DBU) and N-methylated TBD
(MTBD) were used as catalysts instead of TBD, no polymerization was observed,even with catalyst loading of up to 20 mol% [ 89]. The lack of activity of these
amines was accounted for by the absence of any activation of the lactone, and theactivation of the alcohol turned out to be not sufﬁcient. However, the polymeriza-tion was successfully carried out by the addition of a thiourea as a co-catalyst toactivate lactones, as shown in Fig. 23. Again, b-butyrolactone was not reactive
enough and was not polymerized [ 89].
The implementation of phosphazene bases as organocatalysts was also
investigated in order to efﬁciently activate alcohols [ 90]. More particularly,
2-tertbutylimino-2-diethylamino-1,3-dimethylperhydrdro-1,3,2-diazaphosphorine(BEMP) was investigated due to its higher basicity (p K
BH+¼27.6) compared to
DBU (p KBH+¼24.3) and MTBD (p KBH+¼25.4). The polymerization of eCL
andd-valerolactone was successfully carried out in the presence of BEMP by using
1-pyrernebutanol as an initiator (Fig. 24). Although the polymerization was under
control, the kinetics were quite low, especially in the case of the polymerization of
eCL, which required 10 days to reach a conversion of 14% [ 90].OO

2.4 Enzymatic Polymerization
Lipases are enzymes of the hydrolase family and, in nature, hydrolyze fatty acid
esters in aqueous environment. It is worth recalling that the hydrolysis of esters is a
reversible reaction. Chemists thus often use lipases to catalyze the reverse reaction,i.e., the esteriﬁcation and the ROP of lactones. In 1993, the groups of Kobayashi[91] and Knani [ 92] reported independently the lipase-catalyzed ROP of eCL and
d-valerolactone. The aliphatic polyesters were functionalized by a carboxylic group
at one chain-end and a hydroxyl group at the other chain-end. Accordingly, thepolymerization was initiated and terminated by water present in the reaction media.
Since then, the process has been extended to a wide variety of lactones of
different size and to several lipases, as recently reviewed [ 93–96]. Interestingly,
large-membered lactones, which are very difﬁcult to polymerize by usual anionicand coordination polymerizations due to the low ring strain, are successfullypolymerized by enzymes. Among the different lipases available, that from Candida
antarctica (lipase CA, CALB or Novozym 435) is the most widely used due to its
high activity. An alcohol can purposely be added to the reaction medium to initiatethe polymerization instead of water. The polymerization can be carried out in bulk,in organic solvents, in water, and in ionic liquids. Interestingly, Kobayashi and
coworkers reported in 2001 the ROP of lactones by lipase CA in supercritical CO
2
[97]. Later, Howdle and coworkers supported lipase CA on macroporous beads
[98]. It is worth noting that the enzyme can be withdrawn and recycled by using
supercritical CO 2. The success of the polymerizations carried out in organic
solvents stems directly from the sustained activity of several lipases in organicsolvents. In this respect, it must be noted that water has a manifold inﬂuence on thecourse of the polymerization. On the one hand, water can initiate the polymeriza-tion. On the other hand, a minimum amount of water has to be bound to the surface
of the enzyme to maintain its conformational ﬂexibility, which is essential for its
catalytic activity [ 94]. Lipase-mediated polymerization cannot therefore be
achieved in strictly anhydrous conditions.
The mechanism of the enzymatic polymerization is shown in Fig. 25and can
be decomposed into three main steps. First, a complex is formed between theenzyme and the lactone. The second step is based on the nucleophilic activationof the lactone by the hydroxyl function belonging to a serine residue of the activeOO

site of the enzyme. An activated opened monomer is obtained, which is more
reactive than lactone towards nucleophiles. Finally, the activated opened monomerreacts with nucleophilic hydroxyl-functionalized initiators and propagating species(Fig. 25). It is worth noting that this activation monomer mechanism is very similar
to that shown in the section 2.3.4 dealing with ROP catalyzed by nucleophilicorganocatalysts.
A key point should be to identify the rate-limiting step of the polymerization.
Several studies indicate that the formation of the activated open monomer is therate-limiting step. The kinetics of polymerization obey the usual Michaelis–Mentenequation. Nevertheless, all experimental data cannot be accounted for by thistheory. Other studies suggest that the nature of the rate-limiting step dependsupon the structure of the lactone. Indeed, the reaction of nucleophilic hydroxyl-functionalized compounds with activated opened monomers can become the rate-limiting step, especially if sterically hindered nucleophilic species are involved.
Unlike chemical ROP, enzymatic ROP is not governed by the ring strain.
Unexpectedly, several studies showed that macrolides polymerize faster thansmaller ring lactones when lipases are used as catalysts. It was shown thatmacrolides exhibit a higher dipole moment and are thus more hydrophobic thansmaller ring lactones [ 99]. This factor was invoked to shed light on the very
particular reactivity of lactones in enzymatic ROP. Indeed, the faster kinetics ofpolymerization of macrolides was accounted for by their better recognition bylipases due to their higher hydrophobicity and to their shape. Indeed, macrolides
have a chemical structure closer to the glycerol fatty acids esters hydrolyzed by
lipases in nature.OO

The beneﬁts of enzymes as catalysts for the ROP of lactones are manifold:
– Enzymes are green catalysts obtained from renewable resources
– Enzymes are easily separated from the polyesters– The polymerization proceeds under mild conditions in terms of pH, temperature
and pressure
– The polymerization can be carried out in bulk, in organic media, and at various
interfaces
– The polymerization is not carried out under strictly anhydrous conditions as is
the case when aluminum and tin alkoxides are used as initiators
– The polymerization can take place with high regio- and stereoselectivity– Enzymes are very efﬁcient catalysts for the polymerization of large-size
lactones, which are particularly difﬁcult to polymerize by usual chemicalcatalysts and initiators owing to the low ring strain
Nevertheless, the use of enzymes presents some drawbacks. Enzymes are
expensive and large amounts are needed for polymerization. Besides, it is stillquite challenging to synthesize high molar mass polyesters. The control of poly-merization remains less efﬁcient with enzymes than with chemical initiators such asaluminum alkoxides.
3 Polymerization of Substituted Lactones
The polymerization of substituted lactones is an attractive strategy for extending therange of aliphatic polyesters and for tailoring important properties such as biodeg-radation rate, bioadherence, crystallinity, hydrophilicity, and mechanical properties[100]. Moreover, the substituent can bear a functional group, which can be very
useful for the covalent attachment of drugs, probes, or control units.
The most direct route towards functionalized aliphatic polyesters is based on the
functionalization of polyester chains. This approach is a very appealing because a
wide range of functionalized aliphatic polyesters could then be made available from
a single precursor. This approach was implemented by Vert and coworkers usinga two-step process. First, PCL was metallated by lithium diisopropylamide withformation of a poly(enolate). Second, the poly(enolate) was reacted with anelectrophile such as naphthoyl chloride [ 101], benzylchloroformate [ 101]
acetophenone [ 101], benzaldehyde [ 101], carbon dioxide [ 102] tritiated water [ 103],
a-bromoacetoxy- o-methoxy-poly(ethylene oxide) [ 104], or iodine [ 105] (Fig. 26).
The implementation of this strategy is, however, difﬁcult because of a severe
competition between chain metallation and chain degradation. Moreover, the con-
tent of functionalization is quite low ( <30%), even under optimized conditions.
A less direct strategy relies on the synthesis and ROP of substituted and/or
unreactive functionalized lactones [ 100]. Two approaches can be implemented. In
the ﬁrst approach, the unreactive functional group is inserted directly inside thering. It is worth recalling that cyclic diesters such as lactide and glycolide, for whichRecent Developments in Ring-Opening Polymerization of Lactones 195
both esters can be involved in the polymerization, will not be covered by this
review. The second approach is based on the synthesis and polymerization oflactones bearing a substituent, functionalized or not.
Lactones bearing functions inside the ring that do not interfere with the ROP
mechanism, such an ether [ 106–113], an amine [ 114,115], an amide [ 116–118], an
unsaturation [ 119–122], or a ketone [ 123] are shown in Fig. 27. If the functional
group is not tolerated by the polymerization mechanism, it has then to be protected
as is the case for amines [ 114,115].
It is worth noting that 6,7-dihydro-2(3 H)-oxepinone is an unusual lactone
because it can be polymerized by two distinct mechanisms: ROP of the cyclicesters by aluminum alkoxides, and the ring-opening metathesis polymerization(ROMP) of endocyclic oleﬁns by the Schrock’s catalyst (Fig. 28)[121].OO

The metathesis route opens up new opportunities for the synthesis of new
copolymers by copolymerizing 6,7-dihydro-2(3 H)-oxepinone with other cyclic
oleﬁns such as norbornene, even though this approach has barely been exploited
until now [ 121].
The second approach is based on the pol ymerization of lactones bearing
functionalized substituents. A se t of lactones bearing chloride [ 124–126], bro-
mide [ 127,128], iodide [ 129], alkene [ 130–134], or alkyne [ 135]w e r e
synthesized and (co)polymerized by tin o ctoate, tin(IV), and aluminum alkoxides
(Fig. 29).
Unfortunately, this strategy presents severe drawbacks. Firstly, several of these
lactones are not commercially available and several steps are often necessary for
their synthesis. Moreover, it is mandatory to rigorously purify theses lactonesbefore polymerization, especially if sensitive alkoxides are used as initiators,which is sometimes a difﬁcult task. Accordingly, the global yield of the synthesisis sometimes low and the functionalized lactone is thus quite expensive. Anotherissue is the lack of chemoselectivity of the chemical polymerization. Severalfunctional groups such as epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids are not toleratedby propagating species such as aluminum and tin(IV) alkoxides. This drawback was
successfully overcome by the protection of groups such as alcohols [ 15,114,
136–140], amines [ 141–143] and carboxylic acids [ 15,114,139,144–147] prior
to polymerization (Fig. 30). Nevertheless, the protecting groups have to be removed
after polymerization and it is not always easy to ﬁnd deprotection conditions whereno degradation takes place, especially when acidic conditions are used. Benzylicethers and esters have been often used because they are typically deprotectedby hydrogenation, under neutral conditions. In some particular cases, it wasOO

[124–135]Recent Developments in Ring-Opening Polymerization of Lactones 197
observed that the chemoselectivity depends on the nature of the initiator.
For instance, the ketone function is not tolerated by aluminum alkoxides but iswell tolerated by tin(IV) alkoxides for unclear reasons [ 123]. Accordingly, the
polymerization of 5-oxepane-2-dione was successfully carried out by using
2,2-dibutyl-2-stanna-1,3-dioxepane (DSDOP) as an initiator. Conversely, controlwas completely lost when aluminum isopropoxide was used as an initiator [ 148]
and it was then necessary to protect the ketone function in the form of a ketalgroup [ 149].
Last but not least, enzymatic polymerization is more chemoselective than
chemical polymerization as witnessed, for instance, by the successful polymeriza-tion of functionalized lactones bearing unsaturations and epoxides (Fig. 31)[150].
Many of these substituted lactones possess at least one chiral center and are thus
present as a mixture of stereoisomers. The simplest case is based on the polymeriza-tion of lactones with one chiral center, which is thus a mixture of two RandS
enantiomers. These stereochemical aspects have been completely overlooked inmany works: the polymerization is carried out on a racemic mixture and no stereoselectivity is reported or even discussed. It is worth pointing out that several metal-based catalysts were successfully designed for the stereoselective polymerization ofO

lactide, even though their description is beyond the scope of this review. Neverthe-
less, a few examples dealing with the stereoselective polymerization of cyclicmonoesters are reported. For instance, Carpentier reported the stereoselective poly-merization of racemic b-butyrolactone into syndiotactic poly( b-butyrolactone) by an
yttrium-based catalyst (Fig. 32)[12,151]. A chain-end control was proposed to
account for the syndioselectivity [ 134]. Later, this syndiotactic polymerization was
extended to 4-(but-3-en-1-yl)- b-butyrolactone [ 152].
Interestingly, enzymes are chiral catalysts and their potential for enantio-
selective polymerization has been investigated [ 93]. Several examples are reported
where a racemic mixture of lactones is polymerized by enzymatic polymerizationto afford the corresponding optically active polyester [ 93]. For instance, lipase
CA (Novozym 435) catalyses the ROP of racemic 4-methyl- e-caprolactone and
4-ethyl- e-caprolactone in bulk at 45
/C14C and 60/C14C to afford ( S)-enriched poly(4-
methyl- e-caprolactone) and poly(4-ethyl- e-caprolactone) with an enantiomeric
purity higher than 95% [ 153].
4 Macromolecular Engineering by ROP of Lactones
A change of architecture is another route that enables diversiﬁcation of the
properties of aliphatic polyesters. This review will focus on star-shaped, graft,macrocyclic, and crosslinked aliphatic polyesters. It must be noted that the ROPof lactones has been combined with several other polymerization mechanisms such
as ROP of other heterocyclic monomers, ionic polymerization, ROMP, and radical
polymerization. Nevertheless, this review will not cover these examples and willfocus on polymers exclusively made up of poly(lactone)s.
4.1 Star-Shaped Polyesters

synthesis: arm-ﬁrst and core-ﬁrst. The arm-ﬁrst method is based on the reaction of
living chains with multifunctional electrophiles carrying at least three reactinggroups. The core-ﬁrst method relies on the initiation of the polymerization by amultifunctional ( >2) initiator.
An example of the synthesis of a three-arm star-shaped PCL by the arm-ﬁrst
method is shown in Fig. 33[154]. First, the arms were synthesized by the ROP of
eCL initiated by aluminum alkoxides. Then, the living polymers were reacted with
a three-functional terminating agent, i.e., benzene-1,3,5-tricarbonyl trichloride. The
implementation of this approach implies the coupling of chains. However, thisreaction can be kinetically difﬁcult to carry out, especially when the reactive sites atthe origin of the coupling are buried, depending upon the conformation adopted bythe polyester chains. As a rule, as the molar mass of the arms increases, the sterichindrance increases at the expense of the efﬁciency of the coupling reaction. In theexample shown in Fig. 33, the molar mass is limited to 10,000 g/mol. Moreover, the
steric hindrance will also increase when star-shaped polyesters with a higher
number of arms are targeted. A non-quantitative coupling reaction would result in
the formation of a mixture of linear and star-shaped polyesters with a variablenumber of arms. Unfortunately, the fractionation of this mixture to obtain purewell-deﬁned star-shaped polyesters is a very tedious or even impossible.
The core-ﬁrst approach is based on the initiation of polymerization by a multi-
functional initiator. The number of arms is then deﬁned by the number of functionalunits present on the core. In order to have a good control of the molecular structure ofstar-shaped polyesters, the initiation must be quantitative and fast. It is also manda-
tory to avoid possible side-reactions between the initiating species on the core.
To this end, a very widely used approach is ROP initiated by polyols (at least
triols) in the presence of tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) [ 155,156]. By implementing
this technique, alcohols are dormant species and have to be activated by reactionwith tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) into tin alkoxides to initiate or to propagate thepolymerization. The alcohols are thus not activated at the same time and no side-reactions between them are observed. Besides, it is more appropriate to initiateX O

the polymerization using polyols with all alcohols exhibiting a similar reactivity.
Thus, polyols made up exclusively of primary alcohols are preferred, even thoughexamples of initiators made up of a mixture of primary and secondary alcohols suchas glycerol [ 157] are also reported. Some examples of initiators are reported in
Fig.34. A very nice example was provided by Hawker and Hedrick, who reported
the synthesis of a 48-arm star-shaped PCL using a dendritic polyester
functionalized by 48 alcohols [ 158]. It is worth noting that the initiation turned
out to be less efﬁcient than that of the corresponding hyperbranched polyester.
Multifunctional initiators made up of metal alkoxides rather than alcohols
have been less used for the synthesis of star-shaped polyesters than have the tin(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate)/alcohol system. Nevertheless, Kricheldorf initiated thepolymerization of eCL using a spiro-cyclic tin(IV) alkoxide to obtain a tin-
containing height-shaped polyester whose ﬁnal hydrolysis resulted in the formation
of a star-shaped polyester (Fig. 35)[25,159–161].
Interestingly, Hedrick and coworkers reported a metal-free approach for the
synthesis of star-shaped copolymers. They synthesized star-shaped PCLs by theROP of eCL initiated by polyols in the presence of unencumbered N-heterocyclic
carbenes [ 87].
Finally, Lecomte and coworkers reported the synthesis of mikto-arm star-shaped
aliphatic polyesters by implementing a strategy based on click chemistry (Fig. 36)
[162]. Firstly, the polymerization of eCL was initiated by a diol bearing an alkyne
function. The chain-ends were protected from any further undesired reaction by
the esteriﬁcation reaction with acetyl chloride. The alkyne was then reacted with3-azidopropan-1-ol. The hydroxyl function located at the middle of the chainwas then used to initiate the ROP of eCL and g-bromo- e-caprolactone. Finally,
pendant bromides were reacted successfully with sodium azide and then with N,
N-dimethylprop-2-yn-1-amine to obtain pendant amines. Under acidic conditions,
pendant amines were protonated and the polymer turned out to exhibit amphiphilicproperties.OH

4.2 Comb-Shaped and Graft Polyesters
Although many examples of syntheses of graft copolymers by the combination of
the ROP of lactones with other polymerization mechanisms have been reported,there are only a few examples dealing with the synthesis of comb-shaped and graftpolymers exclusively made up of poly(lactone)s [ 163]. Three main strategies are
known for the synthesis of comb-shaped and graft polymers. The ﬁrst approach,known as the “grafting through” process, relies on the polymerization ofmacromonomers, i.e., chains end-capped by a polymerizable moiety. In the secondapproach, the “grafting onto” process, end-reactive chains are coupled onto a
mutually reactive polymer backbone. However, the coupling of chains might be
kinetically difﬁcult, depending on the conformation adopted by chains in thesolvent used for the reaction and on the molar mass of the chains. Besides, thecoupling is not quantitative so a mixture of polyesters is obtained, and the puriﬁca-tion can be challenging. In the third approach, the “grafting from” process, graftcopolymers can be prepared by initiating the polymerization using a macroinitiator.For instance, this approach was implemented by Je ´roˆme and coworkers who
reported the polymerization of eCL initiated by a polyester bearing pendant
hydroxyl groups (Fig. 37)[137]. The macroinitiator was synthesized by the ROP
ofeCL, 5-triethylsilyloxy- e-caprolactone, and 1,4,8-trioxaspiro[4.6]undecan-9-one
(TOSUO), followed by the acetylation of the chain-end and the deprotection of thesilyl ethers (Fig. 37)[137]. It is worth noting that the further conversion of the ketal
groups into hydroxyl functions prone to initiate the ROP of a second monomer wascarried out in order to synthesize heterograft copolyesters [ 137].OO

4.3 Hyperbranched Polymers
The interest in synthesizing highly branched aliphatic polyesters is driven by their
unique mechanical and rheological properties. Dendrimers (from the Greek“dendra” for tree) are globular macromolecules that are characterized by both amultiplicity of reactive chain-ends and a highly branched structure, in which allbonds converge to a focal point or core. Dendrimers have a very regular structureand are synthesized step-by-step by convergent or divergent strategies.
Hyperbranched polymers have a less regular structure but their synthesis is easier.
The ROP of lactones was implemented to synthesize hyperbranched polyesters. Thestrategy relies on the polymerization of an AB
xinimer. An inimer is a molecular
made up of a unit prone to initiate the polymerization (A) and a polymerizable unit(B). Typical AB
xinimer precursors of hyperbranched aliphatic polyesters are
lactones substituted by unprotected alcohols, where xstands for the number of
hydroxyl groups.
Fre´chet and coworkers reported a ﬁrst example of the synthesis of a
hyperbranched aliphatic polyester by polymerization of an AB inimer, i.e.,
4-(hydroxyethyl)- e-caprolactone [ 164]. It is worth noting that the synthesis of this
inimer is quite long. Since this pioneering work, other teams have reported thepolymerization of a series of AB [ 165–167] and AB
2[168] inimers, which are
shown in Fig. 38. The polymerization of these inimers can be carried out in the
absence or presence of a comonomer such as eCL [167].
4.4 Macrocycles
There are only a few studies dealing with cyclic aliphatic polyesters owing to their
difﬁcult synthesis [ 169]. Until recently, most works were based on ring-expansion
polymerization. In the pioneering work of Kricheldorf and coworkers, cyclicOOOiPrOO

aliphatic polyesters were synthesized by the ROP of lactones initiated by cyclic tin
(IV) alkoxides, typically 2,2-dibutyl-2-stanna-1,3-dioxepane (DSDOP) (Fig. 39)
[24,170]. Interestingly, no high dilution is needed and the polymerization can even
be carried out in bulk. Unfortunately, the macrocyclic polyesters synthesizedby this technique contain hydrolytically sensitive endocyclic tin–oxygen bondsand the hydrolysis brings about an opening of the macrocycle (Fig. 39). The hydro-
lytic stability was improved by end-capping the cycles with 1,3-dihtian-2-oneOO

(Fig. 39)[171]. Another approach relies on the insertion of a few lactones bearing
pendant acrylic units, followed by an intramolecular crosslinking by UV irradiation(Fig. 39)[172].
Very recently, Hedrick and coworkers reported a very original process for
the synthesis of macrocyclic poly( b-lactone)s by ring-expansion polymerization
ofb-lactones initiated by metal-free spirocyclic initiators [ 173]. Indeed, a saturated
carbene, i.e., 1,3-dimesitylimidazolin-2-ylidene, mediated the ROP of b-lactones to
afford the corresponding cyclic polyester through the mechanism shown in Fig. 40.
The carbene reacted with the monomer to afford a spirocyclic adduct. This adductturned out to be the initiator of the polymerization. The reaction with carbondisulﬁde (CS
2) enabled release of the cyclic aliphatic polyester by an unclear
mechanism. As far as the polymerization of optically active ( R)-b-butyrolactone
was concerned, cyclic poly[( R)-b-butyrolactone] was obtained with retention of
conﬁguration. This experimental observation implies that the polymerization took
place by the scission of the acyl–oxygen bond and not the alkyl–oxygen bond,which would result in an inversion of conﬁguration.
One of the more usual strategies aiming at synthesizing macrocycles is based on
the direct coupling of the two chain-ends of a linear chain [ 169]. Undesired chain-
extension reactions, which compete with the desired cyclization of a single chain,can be disfavored by using ultrahigh dilution conditions. Unlike ring-expansionpolymerization, the entanglements of the chains results, after cyclization, in the
formation of permanent knots and catenanes. Several reactions were investigated
for carrying out the cyclization of the linear precursor. For poly(lactone)s, thecoupling was carried out by ring-closing metathesis [ 174], ring-closing enyne
metathesis [ 174], and click copper-catalyzed Huisgen’s cycloaddition [ 174–176].
Of these methods, the click copper-catalyzed Huisgen’s cycloaddition appeareda particularly efﬁcient reaction [ 174]. For instance, Grayson and coworkers
synthesized macrocyclic PCL by the procedure shown in Fig. 41[176]. Firstly,OONC

3-azidopropanol initiated the polymerization of eCL in the presence of tin octoate.
Secondly, the hydroxylated chain-end of the resulting PCL was esteriﬁedby 4-pentynoic anhydride in pyridine and in the presence of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) as a catalyst. Finally, the coupling of the chain-ends was carriedout in dichloromethane in the presence of copper bromide as a catalyst and
N,N,N
0,N00,N00-pentamethyldiethylene triamine (PMDETA) as a ligand. Although
more work is needed to assess the inﬂuence of the cyclic topology on properties, itis worth pointing out that the cyclic architectures yield a delay in the loss of molarmass during the acid-catalyzed degradation.
4.5 Networks
The crosslinking of polyesters is a widely used process for tailoring key propertiessuch as crystallinity, biodegradation rate, and mechanical behavior. Interestingly,chemically crosslinked PCL exhibits remarkable shape-memory properties[177,178]. One can distinguish intra- and intermolecular crosslinking. A nice
example is provided by Hedrick and coworkers who implemented a thermal radicalcrosslinking of PCL bearing pendant acrylates [ 179]. Under ultradilute conditions,
intramolecular crosslinking took place and nanoparticles with very small sizes were
then prepared. Conversely, under concentrated conditions, the crosslinking isintermolecular and a three-dimensional network can then be obtained. Manyother works report the synthesis of networks by the crosslinking of polyestersbearing pendant unsaturations. The crosslinking is usually carried out thermallyin the presence of a source of radicals [ 179] or photochemically [ 133,180]. A veryOH N3OO

similar approach relies on the crosslinking of polyesters bearing double bonds
present directly inside the chains [ 181]. A simpler route towards crosslinked
aliphatic polyesters relies on the synthesis and crosslinking of linear aliphatic
polyesters end-capped by a polymerizable unsaturation at each chain-end [ 182].
The number of reactive chain-ends can be increased by using star-shaped ratherthan linear polyesters [ 183].
Another approach for the synthesis of networks relies on the polycondensation
of multifunctionalized polyesters with the appropriate multifunctionalized agent,provided that one of the partner is at least tri-functionalized. Toward this end,several reaction have been reported, such as the Michael addition of aminesonto acrylates [ 184], the coupling of ketones and oxyamines [ 185], the click
copper(II)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition [ 186], and esteriﬁcation reactions
[25,159,187]. Interestingly, if esteriﬁcation reactions are used, the crosslinks are
then degradable.
Albertsson and coworkers proposed another strategy based on the ROP of
tetrafunctional bis-( e-caprolactones), e.g., using 4,4
0-bioxepane-7,70-dione and
5,50-propane-2,2-diyldioxepan-2-one as crosslinking agents (Fig. 42)[188,189].
Networks were obtained by the ROP of lactones in the presence of these bis-lactones. Another approach was to transesterify aliphatic polyesters in the presence
of the bis-lactone [ 188,189]. It is worth noting than other bis-heterocycles
polymerizable by ROP have been used as crosslinking agent, such as bis-carbonates[190] or lactones bearing pendant epoxides [ 178].
5 Conclusions
Owing to the outstanding control imparted to the ROP of lactones and the remark-
able properties of biodegradable aliphatic polyesters, steadily increasing attention
has been paid to its development over the last few decades. Among the various
processes investigated so far, coordination polymerization initiated by suitablemetal alkoxides turned out to be particularly efﬁcient. A wide range of lactones,functionalized or not, have been synthesized and polymerized. The living characterof the ROP of lactones has been exploited to synthesize aliphatic polyesters withvarious architectures. Although this ﬁeld can be considered as mature, someO

important issues remained to be addressed. The toxicity of tin- and aluminum-based
initiators is a severe limitation for many applications and especially for biomedicalapplications because metallic remnants are very difﬁcult to get rid of. These
drawbacks have prompted researchers to investigate new efﬁcient processes
based on less toxic metals than tin and aluminum, and on metal-free polymerizationtechniques. In this respect, the recent advent of efﬁcient organocatalysts is verypromising. Although more work is needed to assess the toxicity of these catalysts,they will obviously be more and more widely used in the future. Another challengewill be to search for more efﬁcient processes for the synthesis of lactones, espe-cially substituted and functionalized lactones. Although eCL is synthesized and
polymerized at the industrial scale, the syntheses of many other functionalized
lactones remain too expensive for many applications. Special attention will have to
be paid to their synthesis by green processes, and ideally from renewable resources.

Recent Developments in Metal-Catalyzed
Ring-Opening Polymerization of Lactidesand Glycolides: Preparation of Polylactides,
Polyglycolide, and Poly(lactide- co-glycolide)
Saikat Dutta, Wen-Chou Hung, Bor-Hunn Huang, and Chu-Chieh Lin
Abstract A good synergy of a catalytic system’s components, such as ancillary
ligands and leaving groups at the active site of a catalyst, is of fundamentalimportance in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of lactides and lactones.This article surveys recent advances in the metal-promoted ROP of lactide and
glycolide for the preparation of poly(lactide) (PLA), poly(glycolide) (PGA), and
their copolymer poly(lactide- co-glycolide) (PLGA). First, there is a general discus-
sion on mechanisms, the undesirable effects of side reactions on the rate ofpolymerization, and how the ﬁrst generation of ROP catalysts such as SnOct
2[tin
(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, also known as tin(II) octoate] work as efﬁcient initiators.Then, the study focuses on the ROP capability of monomeric and multinuclearcomplexes of Li, Ca, Mg, Zn, Al, and Ti metals for the efﬁcient preparation of PLA.Special emphasis is given to the factors controlling polymer molecular weight,
molecular weight distribution, and the suppression of transesteriﬁcation side
reactions and epimerization of monomers. Surpassing the pure model nature ofmany structurally well-deﬁned catalytic systems such as bis(phenoxide)-Li, bis(phenoxide)-Mg, trispyrazolylborate-Mg/Zn, and b-diketiiminate-Mg/Zn, the
applicability and performance of N,O-donor Schiff base Mg/Zn systems in theproduction of PLAs are highlighted. The emerging “structure-polymerization”activity is also addressed. Special attention is given to Ca, Mg, and Zn initiatorswhich, due to their biocompatibility, are considered the safest to be used in the
preparation of PLAs for biomedical purposes. Likewise, the polymerization activity
of the metal initiators is evaluated on the basis of the Lewis acidic properties of thecentral metal. Alternatives like trivalent lanthanide systems with ancillary ligands

such as bis(amidinate), b-ketoiminate, bis(phenolate), and Schiff bases are consid-
ered. Some recently investigated coordination complexes of Cu, Ni, Ag, and Aumetals used in the solvent-free melt polymerization of lactide are discussed in terms
of structure–activity relationships. The substantial role of the ligand geometry on
the stereocontrol of the rac-lactide polymerization is addressed to ﬁnally summa-
rize the key components essential for obtaining PLAs of desired microstructurefrom rac- and meso -lactides. The development of glycolide ROP catalysts based on
Sn, Zn, Sm, and Bi is addressed and their effectiveness in producing copolyesters oflactide and glycolide such as PLGA assessed.

1 Introduction
Poly(lactide) (PLA), an aliphatic polyester with a lactide (LA) monomeric unit, isone of the synthetic polymers to be derived from renewable resources such as starch
harvested from corn or sugar beet [ 1]. Biologically degradable PLA is often
referred to as “bioplastic” and is a potential alternative to petrochemicals. Itundergoes biodegradation via hydrolysis to produce lactic acid, which can bemetabolized in vivo or in the environment [ 2–5]. Fermentation of renewable wastes
containing starch generates lactic acid, whose further condensation and depolymer-ization yield the desired monomeric building block lactide, as shown in Fig. 1.
Previously, PLAs were obtained via condensation of lactic acid by heating and
driving off water, which produced a gummy polymeric material of ill-deﬁned
molecular weight and microstructure [ 6]. Ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of
dilactones, pioneered by Carothers in 1932 [ 7], was the ﬁrst initiative for an

alternative route of preparation of PLAs. In the 1990s, growing interest in sustain-
able plastics and improvement of monomer production enabled the Carothersmethod to be recognized and it has attracted signiﬁcant interest over the past few
decades. Since the 1970s, copolymers based on lactic acid and glycolic acid, such as
PLGA, have been utilized for medical applications such as a degradable matrix forthe slow release of drugs [ 8]. A larger scale application of PLA as a biodegradable
material has only become reality very recently when certain products such as foodand drinks containers, pillow liners, and many more have been introduced com-mercially, as represented in Fig. 2. For this reason, major investigations have
focused on the preparation of PLAs, PGA, and related copolymers of lactide andglycolide, namely PLGA, by adapting the method of ROP in the presence of a metal
catalyst (Scheme 1).
However, the ROP of lactide and glycolide remains by far the most extensively
practiced method in industry and academia for the preparation of polyesters. Thismethod allows a better control of polymerization in terms of high molecular weight,narrow polydispersity, monomer-to-initiator ratio and sequence, well-deﬁned

polymer chain-ends, and desired tacticity. Numerous efforts have been dedicated
over the last decade to the development of efﬁcient metal catalysts to promote theROP of lactide under mild conditions and combining catalytic efﬁciency and
polymerization control. Lactide and glycolide are among the rare polymerizable
six-membered rings with a satisfactory polymerization enthalpy (in the case oflactide, around /C023 kJ mol
/C01[9]). This can be associated to the relief of the ring
strain [ 10] and stands out as the driving force for the ring-opening step. However,
the polymerization enthalpy remains modest so that the ROP thermodynamicequilibrium is not highly favorable, especially at high temperature: [lactide]
eq¼
0.045 mol L/C01at 20/C14C and 0.129 mol L/C01at 120/C14C[11].
ROP of lactide and glycolide catalyzed by metal salts or well-deﬁned complexes
has been demonstrated to follow mainly two different pathways, either an anionic
polymerization (nucleophilic) or a coordination–insertion polymerization. AnionicROP proceeds through either the deprotonation of the monomer or its ring openingby nucleophilic attack, as shown in Scheme 2a. In the case of an acyl cleavage
promoted via metal salts such as butyl lithium, lithium or potassium tert-butoxide,
and potassium methoxide, the polymerization principally proceeds via attack ofthe initiating or propagating alkoxide at the carbon of the ester group, followedby the ring opening at the acyl C–O bond, as shown in Scheme 2b[12–16].
Application of metal salts and well-deﬁned metal complexes in ROP has enabled
the exploitation of a three-step coordination–insertion mechanism, ﬁrst formulatedin 1971 by Dittrich and Schulz [ 17]. This proceeds through coordination of lactide
by the carbonyl oxygen to the Lewis acidic metal center, leading to the initiationand subsequent propagation by a metal alkoxide species. This species can be eitherisolated or generated in situ by addition of an alcohol to a suitable metal precursorto result in the formation of a new chain-extended metal alkoxide, as shown inScheme 3[16].

These approaches have enabled the facile preparation of PLAs and PGA of
commercial relevance with high molecular weight, controlled molecular weightdistribution, and well-deﬁned chain-ends. In addition, many of these metal salts and
complexes used as ROP catalysts display a much greater tolerance to protic
impurities and prevent monomers from an epimerization during the polymerization.In the metal catalyzed coordination–insertion polymerization, the efﬁciency of themolecular weight control depends not only on the ratio of initiation and propagationrates ( k
propagation /kinitiation ) but also on the extent of the side-transesteriﬁcation.
These intra- and intermolecular backbiting reactions lead to macrocyclic structuresand oligomers and to a complex polymerization/depolymerization equilibrium(Scheme 4)[18]. All of these troublesome side reactions sometimes contribute to
broad molecular weight distributions and a low control of the polymerization.
In most cases, the extent of the undesirable transesteriﬁcation reactions can bedirectly connected to insufﬁcient control of the reactivity of the metal initiator(Lewis acidity of the metal and/or ligand design) [ 19].
SnOct
2, which is actually a carboxylate and not an alkoxide (tin 2-
ethylhexanoate), has been the most commonly applied metal catalyst for theindustrial preparation of PLA and PGA (Scheme 5), providing polyesters with
high molecular weights. This catalyst also has a signiﬁcant control over the
molecular weight distribution and the nature of the end groups. This is valuable
for biomedical applications involving biodegradable ﬁbers and tissue engineeringscaffolds [ 20–22].
While the exact mechanism remains under debate, a coordination–insertion
mechanism was generally accepted for the Sn(II) initiators [ 20]. In addition,
SnOct
2has been demonstrated to be an efﬁcient catalyst in the presence of alcohols,
especially at elevated temperatures. However, it is also known to undergo inter- and

intramolecular transesteriﬁcation side reactions throughout the polymerization
process that lead to decreased control and result in polyesters with high polydisper-sity indexes (PDI ~ 2; PDI is a measure of the distribution of molecular mass and is
calculated as the weight-average molecular weight divided by the number-average
molecular weight, M
w/Mn)[23].
The biocompatibility and toxicity issue is important for the initiator selection
because, generally, traces of metal residues remain in the polymer and can be animpediment during biodegradation. Alkoxide complexes of Group 1, 2, and Zn(II)alkoxides are generally nontoxic. A controlled polymerization in which a quantita-tive prediction of the physical properties of the polymers is possible, depending onthe nature of the initiator. The degree of control is assessed by the following
criteria: a linear increase in M
nwith percentage conversion, a linear increase in
Mnwith [monomer] 0/[initiator] 0with narrow PDIs, the possibility of producing
block copolymers by monomer addition during the polymerization process, highk
p/kiratio (where kp¼rate of propagation, ki¼rate of initiation), and high kp/ktr
ratio ( ktr¼rate of transesteriﬁcation). In the case of the kinetically controlled
transesteriﬁcation, ROP of lactides could be truly living. The extent of thetransesteriﬁcations in the lactide ROP reaction is determined by gel permeationchromatography (GPC) analysis (increase in PDI), MALDI-TOF mass spectros-
copy (odd number of lactic acid monomers is indicative of the presence of intermo-
lecular transesteriﬁcation), and occasionally by
13C NMR spectroscopy (in ROP of
rac-LA, increase in the isiand/or iisresonance) [ 24–26].
In most cases, the metal-catalyzed ROP activity is best assessed by determining
the polymerization rate constant ( kp). A second order rate law is being followed by
most of the catalytic lactide polymerizations:
/C0d½LA/C138
dt¼kp½LA/C1380½I/C138n
0
where kp¼propagation rate constant, [LA] 0¼initial lactide concentration,
[I]0¼initial concentration of the initiator and n¼order in initiator concentra-
tion/aggregation number.
To determine the kp, it is usual to set out pseudo ﬁrst order experiments at
various concentration of initiator to calculate the pseudo ﬁrst order rate constant(k
app) at each concentration. A ﬁrst order dependency on the monomer concentra-
tion is usually observed in such experiments, and the rate constant is given as:
/C0d½LA/C138
dt¼kapp½LA/C1380
Generally, activities of the catalysts are expressed in terms of kp, but in some
cases analysis of the kappvalues will also be used.Recent Developments in Metal-Catalyzed Ring-Opening Polymerization 225
2 Focus and Scope
This chapter will deliver an overview of the increasingly expanding research on
ROP of lactide and glycolide catalyzed by well-deﬁned, single-site metalcomplexes for the preparation of value-added biodegradable polymers such asPLAs, PGA, and their copolymer PLGA. Since several reviews have been madein the recent years on diverse aspects of this area [ 16,23,27–30], including the
more recent articles on stereocontrolled ROP of cyclic esters [ 31,32], we will
discuss the progress made in the past decade in designing well-deﬁned initiatorsbased on biometals like Ca, Mg, and Zn. Technological aspects such as catalyst
efﬁciency, effects of solvents, polymerization temperatures are discussed with
many examples. A considerable part of this review ( Sect. 3 ) describes the diverse
set of ligands used for the development of metal catalysts and the effect of steric andelectronic parameters on the rate of the polymerization as well as on the selectivityof polymerization. Section 3.2will focus on the spectacular results demonstrated in
the lactide polymerization by zinc and magnesium catalysts involving N-, O-, andN,O-donor ligand systems. The present account also aims at a brief survey of thecatalysts based on lanthanides, group 4 (Ti, Zr), and group 13 (Al, In) elements
(Sects. 3.3–3.5). Less well-established ROP technologies such as the solvent-free,
high temperature, melt polymerization of lactide in the presence of Cu and Aucomplexes as catalysts are also addressed (Sect. 3.6). Dramatic effects of ﬁne
tuning of the metal–ligand geometry on the stereocontrol of ROP of rac-lactide
in solution are also one of the major concerns of this chapter and are illustrated inSect. 4with several recently developed catalytic systems and their stereo-
preferences. In summary, ROP techniques using metal catalysts are evaluated interms of their performance and scope with various reported catalytic systems.
Unsolved and open questions about the ROP techniques using certain main group
metal–catalytic systems are also discussed.
3 Well-Deﬁned Catalysts and Initiators for ROP of Lactides
Since the polymerization kinetics and control are rather complicated whenusing oligomeric metal salts or alkoxides and aggregates as initiators, well-deﬁnedsingle-site catalysts have attracted a lot of interest. Numerous studies with severalwell-deﬁned heteroleptic metal complexes of the type L
nMX (where M ¼metal,
X¼initiating unit of alkoxide or amide, and L n¼ancillary ligand) have been
aimed at enhancing their catalytic activity toward the ROP of lactides and limit the
transesteriﬁcation side reactions. On this basis, large pools of metal complexesfeaturing wide variation of ancillary ligands (principally O-donors, N-donors, andN,O-donors) have been developed to promote ROP of lactide in a controlledmanner via a coordination–insertion mechanism. Recent studies revealed that anefﬁcient catalyst or initiator for controlled ROP of lactide generally requires the226 S. Dutta et al.
following general conditions: (1) the metal should be redox-inactive and inert to a
b-hydrogen abstraction from the growing polymer chain to prevent side reactions
and chain termination, (2) the L nM template should remain inert with respect to
ligand scrambling to prevent the formation of oligomeric metal species and loss of
the single-site catalysis character, and (3) the alkoxide unit in L nMOR should be
labile enough to allow a fast alcohol exchange and insertion reactions to introduce,via chain transfer, new functionalities into the polymer. An overview of the relevantwell-deﬁned and single-site metal catalysts is presented in this section, and com-parative studies of the ROP activity of the structurally similar catalysts are includedwherever required.
3.1 Group 1 Metals (Li, Na, K)
The concept of using group I metal initiators was applied in order to minimize thetoxicity generated by heavy metal residues in the end product PLAs when usingmetals like aluminum, tin, and lanthanides as initiators. In recent years, dinuclearlithium and macro-aggregates with phenolate ligands have attracted substantialinterest, mainly due to uncommon structural features and their ability to catalyzeformation of polyester and various other polymeric materials via ROP [ 28]. A series
of lithium complexes supported with 2, 2-ethylidene-bis (4, 6-di- tert-butylphenol)
(EDBP-H
2)2–6, (Scheme 6) are excellent initiators for the ROP of L-lactide in
CH 2Cl2at 0/C14C and 25/C14C[33–35]. In this case, the PDIs of the obtained PLAs were
quite narrow (1.04–1.14) and a linear relationship between Mnand the monomer-
to-initiator ratio ([M] 0/[I]0) existed at 0/C14C. Dimeric complexes 4and6were the

deﬁned lithium catalyst on L-lactide is presented in Table 1.
Apart from the development of lithium initiators for the facile polymerization of
L-lactide, mainly by our group, there are only a limited number of Na and K initiators
known in the literature. Sodium and potassium cations are nontoxic and are essential
to life, and we reported the ﬁrst EDBP-Na complex as efﬁcient initiator for the
preparation of PLA [ 41]. Similarly, potassium EDBP complex [EDBPH-K-(THF) 2]
18has been demonstrated to be an efﬁcient catalyst for the ROP of L-lactide in a
controlled fashion, yielding PLAs with expected molecular weights and moderatePDIs (1.29–1.58) [ 42].

Alkaline earth metals Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba are biocompatible, nontoxic, and essential
for life [ 43]. In addition, they are relatively inexpensive and have been considered
as alternatives for developing initiators for producing PLAs via ROP of lactides dueTable 1 Comparative ROP activity of various Li initiators for the preparation of PLA

to their electropositive character and biologically benign nature [ 44]. Among these
metals, Ca is kinetically labile and hard, like Mg [ 45]. Calcium acetylacetonate, Ca
(acac) 2, was the ﬁrst calcium initiator to be introduced for polymerization of
glycolide and copolymerization of glycolide with lactide [ 46,47]. Among the
heavier congeners of group 2 metals, simple strontium complexes such as aminoisopropoxyl strontium (Sr-PO, where PO ¼isopropoxyl) have been known to
initiate polymerization of
L-lactide and display an efﬁcient catalysis under mild
conditions to yield PLAs whose molecular weights can be easily adjusted by theratio of monomer to Sr-PO moiety [ 48,49]. In contrast, well-deﬁned barium
initiators for the polymerization of lactide are not common, probably due to thehigh ionic character and the large size of the cation which favors the formation of
insoluble material via an unwanted aggregation of metal centers [ 50].
In the past decade, a distinct advancement of ROP activity has been witnessed for
the zinc and magnesium initiators. Although Zn has similar biocompatible propertiesand essentially similar ionic radii as Mg [ 51], Zn is soft in nature compared to Mg,
which can be seen as a hard metal [ 52] and consequently both of them exhibit different
chemical properties. A systematic comparison of the ROP activity of Mg- andZn-based catalysts surrounded by structurally similar ancillary ligands has been anattractive area for many researchers. As far as the metal-free character and purity of the
ﬁnal polymers is concerned, polymerization catalysts involving biocompatible Mg
2+
and Zn2+are understandably much preferred. Furthermore, Mg2+,C a2+,a n dZ n2+all
are redox-inactive and inert towards b-hydrogen abstraction within the growing
polymer chain and also free from chain termination processes and the related loss ofactivity. However, all three metal ions are kinetically labile and may readily enter intoligand scrambling, which is a rather commonly encountered phenomenon forthe Schlenk equilibrium. Commonly, calcium and barium complexes are prone toligand disproportionation via Schlenk equilibrium between homoleptic and
heteroleptic forms [Scheme 7a]. In the case of a calcium system, Schlenk equilibrium
was found to be completely on the side of the heteroleptic complex and is controlledby steric as well as electronic effects of the ancillary ligand [ 53]. In certain calcium
systems, ligand disproportionation was also dependent on the nature of the solventand an extensive dissociation was recorded in the presence of a coordinating solventsuch as THF [ 54]. Similarly, such equilibrium was reported for homo- and heteroleptic
complexes of barium, as shown in Scheme 7b[55].
The highly ionic character of higher members of group 2 metals (Ca, Sr, Ba)
proved to be a shortcoming, limiting the research to only a scarce number of ROP
catalytic systems with calcium and barium. In order to prevent such expecteddownsides, the presence of suitable bulky substituents adjacent to the donor atomsof the ancillary ligands is highly desirable to repress ligand scrambling in well-deﬁned catalysts. A recently developed method of grafting the calcium catalysts on asilica surface to control the Schlenk equilibrium [ 56] may also inspire the design of
the next generation of group 2 metal catalysts. Commonly used ligands for the Mgand Zn initiators were trispyrazolyl hydroborate, b-diketiminates, bis(phenolate)
(diol), Schiff base, and various other ligands. The polymerization behaviors of230 S. Dutta et al.
several Mg and Zn initiators are summarized in this section, comparing their ROP
activities.
3.2.1 N-Donor Tripodal Ligand-Supported Mg and Zn Complexes
Chisholm and coworkers have introduced trispyrazolyl- and trisindazolylhy-
droborate as monoanionic tridentate ancillary ligands, which can confer thedemanded steric environment around the central metal to prevent unwanted aggre-gation during the polymerization of lactide. In a series of mononuclear alkoxidecomplexes of magnesium ( 19,21)and zinc ( 20,22,23)involving tripodal ligands
(Fig. 4), compound 19produced PLAs with ethoxy end groups via acyl cleavage of
the lactide monomer [ 57–59].
While using 19and20as catalysts, a linear relationship between M
n, conversion
of monomer to polymer (%), and PDI (1.10–1.25) was recorded, which support acontrolled polymerization of
L-lactide. The kinetic studies revealed a ﬁrst order
polymerization of lactide and metal complex in CD 2Cl2and CDCl 3solutions. The
results indicated that magnesium complex 19is more active than its Zn(II) analogs
(6 days, [M] 0/[I]0¼500, CH 2Cl2,2 5/C14C, 90% conversion) due to the expected
higher polarity of the Mg–OR bond relative to that of the zinc complexes.NNBut

The achiral initiators 19and20also displayed a signiﬁcant preference for the
polymerization of meso -lactide over L- and D-lactide in CH 2Cl2at 22/C14C. However,
chiral magnesium complex 21demonstrated a marked preference for the polymeri-
zation of meso -lactide over rac-lactide. In sharp contrast to the behavior of complex
19, the copolymerizatioin of a 1:1 mixture of meso - and rac-lactide in the presence
of the chiral zinc complex 22in CD 2Cl2at 22/C14C revealed that both monomers
(D- and L-lactide) were polymerized at essentially the same rate during the initial
phase of the process (~30% conversion). The chiral complex 22with ( R,R) stereo
centers at theiPr- and Me-substituted carbon atoms exhibits a modest preference for
the polymerization of L-lactide instead of rac-lactide. Complex 23was nearly
inactive for polymerization of L-lactide, probably due to the electron-withdrawing
CF3groups.
3.2.2 N,N-Donor b-Diketiiminate-Supported Mg and Zn Complexes
The successful utilization of alkoxo Zn- and Mg-tris(pyrazolyl) borate initiators in
the lactide polymerization inspired the synthesis of sterically bulky ß-diketiminates(BDIs) (Fig. 5) and their zinc and magnesium derivatives [ 60–62]. Replacing the
ancillary ligands resulted in the production of several mono- and dinuclearcomplexes of Mg
+2and Zn+224–39(Fig. 6), which demonstrated excellent cata-
lytic activity for the polymerization of L- and rac-lactide [ 62–66].
From the polymerization results, it is quite obvious that initiating units such as
–N(SiMe 3)2, –Et, and –OAc were distinctly inferior in their role during the initia-
tion of the polymerization process, as they only led to polymers with broad PDIs
(1.83–2.95) and molecular weights that compared poorly with the theoreticalvalues, unlike the alkoxo derivatives such the isopropoxo unit. To a certain extent,these functional groups are likely to react with impurities such as lactic acid,hydrolyzed lactide, and water, resulting in a slow initiation rate of the polymerization.In contrast, complexes with isopropoxide groups closely mimic the acceptedpropagating groups, producing PLAs of predictable molecular weights and narrowmolecular weight distributions (PDI ~ 1.10). Compared to zinc alkoxides, the mag-
nesium analogs are more active for the polymerization of lactide. For example,
complex 31demonstrated a rapid completion of polymerization of rac-lactide after
2 min at 20
/C14C( [ M g ] 0¼2 mM; [LA] 0¼0.4 M; [LA] 0/[Mg] 0¼200), while
34undergoes complete conversion in 0.33 h [ 66]. A similar behavior in the polymer-
ization rate was recorded in the case of the Mg complex 25(2 min) and Zn complex

28(10 min), with [LA] 0/[Metal] 0¼100 in CH 2Cl2at 20/C14C[63]. The PDIs of the
polymers produced by magnesium complexes were relatively broader (1.47) thanthose of the related zinc complexes (1.15).
On the basis of the above information, a dependence of the rate of initiation on
the leaving group of the catalysts has been derived following this order Mg >Zn
andtert-butoxide (O
tBu)>NiPr2>NSi 2Me6>OSiPh 3. This order reﬂects the
inﬂuence of the contribution of both electronic and steric factors; e.g., while NiPr2
is the most basic initiating unit, its lone pair is sterically less accessible than that ofO
tBu. Both the complexes 38and39displayed poor reactivity, yielding broad PDIs
(1.6 and 1.5, respectively) [ 64]. Furthermore, Zn complex 39underwent some
interconversion involving syn- andanti-conformers where the syn-conformer is
much more active in the polymerization of lactide relative to the anti-form.
To a remarkable degree, tridentate-diketiminate-supported magnesium and zinc
complexes ( 40–42) (Fig. 6) were highly active for the ROP of lactide, affording
80–90% conversion to PLA within 10 min [ 67]. However, the magnesium initiator
40displayed a far less controlled polymerization than either of the zinc complexes
41and42, as indicated by the broader PDIs (1.53–1.78) of the ﬁnal polymers.
In this series, zinc complexes give rise to much lower PDIs (1.10 and 1.15) butmolecular weights were signiﬁcantly higher than the predicted values. Complex
40is attributable to a slow initiation (relative to the propagation step), a conse-
quence of the large NR
2and OSiPh 3leaving groups. Although the initiation was
poor, the chain length increased linearly with the monomer conversion (plot ofM
n¼20,000–50,000 versus conversion 40–95%) in presence of catalyst 42,a s
revealed in the polymerization experiments with a [LA]:[ 42] ratio of 100 in CDCl 3
at 25/C14C, with a ﬁnal PDI of 1.12–1.21.

3.2.3 N,N,O-Donor Tridentate Ketiminate-Supported Mg and Zn Complexes
A series of dinuclear magnesium complexes [LMg( m-OBn)] 2surrounded by N,N,
O-tridentate ketiminate ligands (L) 43a–d (Fig. 7) displayed a dramatically steric
and electronic inﬂuence of the substituents of the ketiminate ligand on their
L-lactide polymerization activity. Speciﬁcally, a sterically bulkier group increases
the activity of a magnesium complex; however, an electron-withdrawing groupdecreases its activity. In this case, a monomer–dimer equilibrium in solution isassumed on the basis of the
1H NMR results. The monomeric species are the most
active during polymerization, which probably proceeds via the coordination ofthe lactide to the monomer, giving a ﬁve-coordinated Mg complex as activeintermediate. The
L-lactide polymerization results, in toluene at room temperature
or 0/C14C, showed a high conversion with all catalysts, leading to polymers with a PDI
range between 1.13 and 1.46 [ 68]. In order to ﬁgure out the role of potential dimeric
forms during the polymerization, freezing point depression experiments wereperformed in order to estimate the dissociation percentage of the dimeric speciesto provide, for instance, 64% dissociation in the case of 43a. On the basis of
variable-temperature
1H NMR studies (Fig. 8), with selected physical parameters
of the polymers and polymerization efﬁciency, a mechanism for the ROP of
L-lactide initiated by 43acan be proposed, as shown in Scheme 8.
Structurally very close to the N,N,O-trid entate ketiminate systems, magnesium
complexes bearing bis-amido-oxazolinate complexes 44a–e were used in the PLA
preparation from L-lactide in the presence of benzyl alcohol. The low reactivity of
44d, e is due to the presence of a pendant functionality engaging the metal center,
and the steric bulk of the phenyl group hindering the coordination of benzylalcohol or of a monomer to the metal center, contributing to a diminution of thepropagation [ 69].
More recently, we have developed aromatic heterocyclic pyrazol-5-one-based

alkoxide systems [L

3.2.4 O-Donor Diol-Supported Mg and Zn Complexes
O-Donor diol ligands such as bisphenols and methylene-bisphenols (Fig. 9) have
been reported as ancillary ligands for lithium-, magnesium-, and zinc-basedcatalysts. Despite the presence of bulky substituents at the ortho positions, all
complexes exhibit dimeric str uctures or higher aggregates in the solid state. Generally,
diol-based Zn complexes showed poor activity in ROP of lactide in comparison tothe multinuclear Li complexes and aggregates. Bis(phenolate) EDBP-H
2- and
MCIMP-H 2-supported dinuclear and tetranuclear complexes of magnesium
47a–dand48were obtained by reactions of diol ligands with MgnBu2in THF or
diethyl ether [ 71,72].
Among these, 47dwas active in ROP of lactide and gives a complete conversion
i n2ha t2 5/C14C at [LA] 0/[Cat] 0/[BnOH] 0of 200:1:2 [ 72], while complex 47a
achieves conversion in 2 h at 83/C14C. Employing zinc complex 48(Fig. 9) as
initiator, lactide polymerization proceeds to 96% conversion within 40 h at room

temperature with PDI ¼1.41 [ 36]. It is found that 47d is more active than the
others, probably due to a higher steric hindrance of the substituent attached to thebridging carbon of the MEMPEP
2/C0ligand. In addition to these systems, we have
recently changed these divalent ancillary ligands into a monovalent analog
by conversion of the alkoxide group into a methoxy group. A benzyloxybridged EDBP-(Me)H-supported dinuclear magnesium initiator [{(EDBP(Me))}Mg(m-OBn)]
249[73] has been shown to be an efﬁcient initiator in L-lactide
polymerization, resulting in molecular weights of the PLLA twice as high asexpected, indicating that only one of the two benzyl alkoxy groups is active inthe polymerization process. Similar results were obtained in case of PLA preparedusing [(EDBP-RTs)Mg(OBn)]
250[74]. Thus, the polymerization activity of 49is
higher (99% conversion in 10 min) than its EDBP analog, probably due to the better
accessibility of the active site with the part-methylated ligand than with the purebidentate ligand. In addition, the activity of 50is much higher than that of 49due to
a lower electron density at the metal center in 50(electron-withdrawing groups
present in the ligands).
3.2.5 N,O-Donor Schiff Base-Supported Mg and Zn Complexes
Schiff base ligands are a particularly suitable alternative in ROP of lactide because
of their ease of preparation and the possibility to easily tunable steric and electronic
properties. Chisholm and coworkers reported Schiff base-supported zinc amide andphenoxide complexes 51a, b (Fig. 10)[75], which catalyze the polymerization of
L-lactide in benzene at room temperature yielding 90% conversion in 3 h for 51a
and 72 h for 51b. The signiﬁcant difference in reactivity between the catalysts can
be taken from the rate of initiation, which is slower for 51aowing to presence of
bulky 2,6- tert-butylphenoxide leaving group.
Recently, N,N,O-tridentate Schiff-based zinc alkoxide complexes 52a–53ehave
been developed by our group [ 76]. All complexes efﬁciently initiate the polymeri-
zation of L-lactide at 25/C14Cw i t h>90% conversion within 30–240 min, with only one
exception, 52cwhich is inactive. The polymerization was well-controlled (PDI ¼
1.04–1.09) and showed that the reactivity decreases with an electron-withdrawing

group on the ligand. Further modiﬁcations of this Schiff base catalytic system, which
differ only in the change of substituents at the imine carbon, have been studied.Speciﬁcally, compounds 52f–i all have a methyl group at the imine carbon, while 52j,
kbears a phenyl group instead [ 77]. All complexes show an astonishing catalytic
activity for the polymerization of
L-lactide at 0/C14C in only 4 min, reaching conversion
of 87–100% to yield polymers with low PDI (1.07–1.16). It is worth noting thatchanging the substituent on the ligand backbone greatly enhances the activity of theresulting zinc alkoxides. A series of magnesium benzyl alkoxides, ( 53a–h ), supported
by N,N,O-tridentate Schiff-base ligands toward the ROP of
L-lactide were
investigated. Experimental results indicate that the reactivity of 53a–h is dramatically
affected by the electronic effect of the substituents on the Schiff-base ligands, and
that53dwith an electron-donating group such as the methoxy group has the highest
reactivity. The reactivity decreased with the substitution of an electron-withdrawinggroup such as Br or Cl [ 78].
Furthermore, experimental results showed that sterically hindered monoether-
salen dinuclear magnesium complex 54initiates the polymerization of lactide at
25
/C14C in 50 min with a 96% conversion, while its zinc complexes 55required 4 h at
60/C14C to reach 95% conversion, with the ratio [LA] 0/[I]0¼100 (Fig. 10)[79].
However, polymerization kinetic studies showed a second order dependency on
[LA] and a ﬁrst order dependency on concentration of complex 54, When complex
55is used as an initiator, the polymerization rate has a ﬁrst order dependency on
both [LA] and [ 55].
Based on the1H NMR spectroscopic studies and kinetic results of complexes 54
and55, we conclude that the intermediate structure of these two complexes should
be different during the polymerization. A dinuclear intermediate has been proposedfor the polymerization initiated by complex 54as shown in Scheme 9.

3.2.6 Other Well-Deﬁned Zn and Mg Complexes
The excellent ROP activity of sterically bulky b-diketiminate complexes reported
by Coates and coworkers inspired the design and synthesis of several bis(phosphinimino)methyl-derived ligands and their related zinc complexes 56–57
(Fig. 11)[80]. Among these, triphenylmethoxy derivative 56cand aryloxy deriva-
tive56d, were active in the ROP of rac-lactide to reach more than 95% conversion
of 100 equiv. of lactide in toluene at 60
/C14C. The enhanced rate of monomer
consumption in the presence of 56bis most likely related to the decreased steric
demands of the leaving group, N(SiMe 3)2. Reportedly, ROP activities of these
phosphinimino-based zinc initiators are lower than those reported for theb-diketiminate zinc alkoxides 34–36, probably due to a carbanionic character of
the bridging methylene carbon that has a higher electron density in the P–CH
2–P
bridge than that found in the b-diketiminate N–CH 2–N bridge.
Dizinc-monoethoxide complex 58(Fig. 11) reported by Hillmyer and coworkers
[81] displayed rapid polymerization of rac-lactide in CH 2Cl2at room temperature
with a [LA] 0/[I]0ratio of 300 and [LA] 0¼1 M; greater than 90% conversion to
PLA occurred within 30 min. PLA derived from L-LA was isotactic, lactide,signifying an absence of epimerization of stereogenic centers during the polymeri-zation. In a similar study, zinc alkyl complexes ( 59a, b) and the alkoxo bridged

dimeric form 60have been reported (Fig. 11)[82]. Compound 60cleaved into four-
coordinate mononuclear species in solution, conﬁrmed by pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR measurements and laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS)
analysis. Complex 60was highly active for the polymerization of rac-lactide in
CH
2Cl2at ambient temperature; with a rate 8.2 times higher than that found with
dinuclear zinc complex 58. Rapid reactions over a wide range of monomer-to-
catalyst ratios and a high conversion of lactide even up to [LA] 0/[60]0of 1,500,
yielding PLA with higher molecular weights (~130 kg mol/C01), qualiﬁed complex
56as one of the most active ROP zinc catalysts. Furthermore, a good molecular
weight control was demonstrated by a linear increase of Mnwith lactide conversion
at [LA] 0/[60]0ratio of around 1,000 and relatively narrow molecular weight
distributions of the polymers (PDI ~1.4).
Hillmyer and coworkers ﬁrst introduced an N-heterocyclic carbene-supported
zinc initiator 61(Fig. 11) for ROP of lactide [ 83], where each zinc center is bound in
a distorted tetrahedral geometry to a carbene carbon, and to two bridging and oneterminal benzyloxide units. In solution, complex 61is highly ﬂuxional via
rapid exchange between terminal and bridging benzyloxide ligand, as evidencedby
1H NMR studies. Kinetic studies revealed a ﬁrst order dependence on [LA] for
complex 61in the polymerization of lactide. A similar dimeric mixed (guanidinate)
(amide) complex [Zn(hpp){N(SiMe 3)2}]262(hpp ¼1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H-
pyrimido[1,2- a]pyrimidine) (Fig. 11) has been introduced [ 84], displaying a 95%
conversion of rac-lactide to PLA in 2 h, with a linear relationship between molecular
weight of the polymers and percentage of conversion, strongly suggesting a “living”character for the polymerization.
Hybrid scorpionate/cyclopentadienyl-Mg ( 63)and -Zn ( 64, 65) complexes were
structurally characterized and reported to catalyze the formation of PLAs withmedium molecular weights and narrow polydispersities [ 85]. Among them, the
magnesium complex 63is much more active than the others, giving a polymeriza-
tion of
L-lactide in toluene at 90/C14C with 97% conversion in 2.5 h. However, it takes
30 h for zinc complexes 64and65to reach similar results under the same
conditions. Some representative structures of magnesium and zinc complexes aresummarized in Table 2as they display closely related ROP activity of lactide, and
often structurally similar ligand systems are employed to construct these initiators.
3.2.7 Comparison of the Lactide Polymerization Activity of Mg
and Zn Complexes
It has been found that magnesium complexes supported with bidentate
b-diketiminate are more active in the ROP of
L- and rac-lactide than their structur-
ally analogous zinc complexes. Faster rate of polymerization of magnesiumcomplexes were such that an almost complete conversion (97%) occurred in1 min at 20
/C14C for a b-diketiminate magnesium complex [(BDI- 1)Mg(OiPr)] 231
(OiPr¼isopropoxide) whereas the zinc analog needed 33 min for a similar
conversion at the same temperature [ 64] (Table 3, entry 1). Similarly a higher240 S. Dutta et al.
activity of polymerization for both L- and rac-lactide was noted for a magnesium
complex 54in comparison to its zinc analog of a salen-type Schiff base ligand
(Table 3, entry 2) [ 79].Table 2 Mg and Zn complexes and their activity in lactide polymerization

It is interesting to note that the Schiff base zinc complexes are signiﬁcantly
more active than the magnesium complexes in the ring opening polymerization of
L-lactide, and the result is rather rare [ 78]. A deviation from the commonly
observed trend of higher activity in case of magnesium initiators in comparisonto the related zinc derivatives were noted in case of the N,N,O -tridentate ketiminateligand systems that contain a pyrazol-5-one ring (Table 3, entry 4) [ 70]. In this case,
faster polymerizations were recorded for both
L- and rac-lactide when using zinc
complex 46as initiator.Table 2 (continued)

The reason for such a change in the polymerization activity in the case of the
zinc-based tridentate ketiminate ligands has not been determined experimentally.Kinetic evidences of the polymerization process and rate law analysis are insufﬁ-
cient to provide any plausible reason for a reversal of the ROP activity. However,
one can argue that M–O
alkoxo bond breaking is much easier for zinc complex 46
compared to its magnesium analog 45due to favorable electronic and steric
parameters of the ketiminate ligand. This would facilitate the formation of newmetal–alkoxo species during the initiation process of polymerization. The dominantrole of the ancillary ligand seems to be conﬁrmed in case of the diketiminate andsalen-type Schiff base ligands, where the magnesium complexes are more activethan the zinc-based ones. The respective solid state X-ray structures support
this argument: longer Zn–O
alkoxo bond lengths of 2.0287(15) and 1.9979(16)
A˚were recorded in the case of the Zn-tridentate ketiminate 46in comparison
to the magnesium complex 45with Mg–O alkoxo bonds of 1.9670(12) and 1.9901
(12) A ˚[70].
3.2.8 N- and O-Donor Ligand-Supported Ca Complexes
It is rather surprising that calcium complexes remain underinvestigated in the lactide
polymerization even though analogous magnesium and zinc complexes werefrequently employed. However, being biocompatible, calcium-based initiators areexpected to be promising alternatives for PLA preparation. Chisholm and Feijen had
developed discrete calcium complexes as initiators for the ROP of lactides. One of
those earliest examples is calcium isopropyloxide generated in situ from the reactionof bis(tetrahydrofuran)calcium bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)amide] and isopropanol,which is highly active in the living and controlled ROP of cyclic esters under mildcondition (18
/C14C) [ 86]. Similar calcium-catalyzed lactide polymerization
was reported by Feijen and coworkers with single-site calcium catalysts [(THF)Ca(tmhd)]
2[p-N(SiMe 3)2](p-tmhd) 66and [(THF)Ca(tmhd)] 2[m-OCH(Me)Ph]
(m-tmhd) 67(Fig. 12) derived from the chelating tmhd ligand (H-tmhd ¼2,2,6,
6-tetramethylheptane-33-dione). Complex 67was highly reactive, promoting a
rapid ROP of L-lactide under mild conditions with PLAs displaying narrow PDIs
(1.14–1.19) and controlled molecular weight at [M] 0/[67]0¼150 [ 87]. In situ
initiator 66/2-propanol, in which 2-propanol probably replaces the bridging
(trimethylsilyl)amido ligand, was much faster in polymerizing lactide with a ﬁrstorder polymerization kinetics.
Inspired by the successful utilization of tris(pyrazolyl)borate-supported magne-
sium and zinc catalysts, Chisholm and coworkers investigated a series of calcium
complexes ( 68–71) (Fig. 12) featuring tris(pyrazolyl)borate([HB(3-Rpz)
3]) and
b-diketiminate (BDI-H) as chelating ligands and amide or alkoxide as reactive
leaving group [ 57,88]. Essentially, sterically congested ligands are essential to
stabilize the monomeric form of the complexes by preventing a Schlenk equilib-rium, which otherwise leads to unidentiﬁable species or aggregates. The reactivityorder of the metal–N bonds toward a ring-opening of lactide is in the followingRecent Developments in Metal-Catalyzed Ring-Opening Polymerization 245
order Ca >Mg>Zn. This was taken from an1H-NMR study, allowing a direct
comparison of reactivity of the related metal amides (BDI)ZnN(SiMe 3)2, (BDI)
MgN(SiMe 3)2, and (BDI)CaN(SiMe 3)2THF in the ring-opening of L-lactide. Com-
plex (BDI)CaN(SiMe 3)2THF 73reacted with rac-lactide (200 equiv.) in THF at
room temperature, giving conversion of up to >90% in 2 h, which is in contrast to
the ROP performance of the complex (BDI)MgN(SiMe 3)2that displayed ca. 90%
conversion to PLA within only 5 min. This reactivity order, Mg >Ca, is the
opposite of that found in related experiments, probably due to the formation of amore stable complex of the form (BDI)CaOP (OP ¼growing polymer chain),
which is not well-deﬁned so far. Considering the larger size of Ca
+2in comparison
to Mg+2and the insufﬁcient steric protection of the BDI ligand to prevent aggrega-
tion or ligand scrambling, the accessibility of the active site of the catalysis is noteasy to control. To further evaluate this fact, a supporting experiment reacting
(BDI)CaN(SiMe
3)273with 1 equiv. of HOiPr at /C078/C14C was performed, giving
(BDI) 2Ca as major product instead of (BDI)CaOiPr, most probably through a ligand
redistribution of (BDI)Ca(OiPr). This suggests that (BDI)Ca(OiPr), whose O-iPr
moiety can be seen as a mimic of the growing polymer species, is not a stablemonomeric unit.
In addition to these, amide complexes 68,71, and 72bearing bulkier
trispyrazolyl borate (Tp) were allowed to react with 200 equiv. of rac-lactide in
THF, and a similar reaction ran using the chiral 9-BBN-Bp(+)-Cam-supported
complex 75. In all cases, polymerization was rapid (90% conversion within
5 min), with complex 68displaying an extremely rapid >90% conversion of lactide
in less than 1 min with a PDI of 1.74 and M
n¼37.8 kg mol/C01of the PLA. The
complex (TptBu)Ca(OC 6H3-2,6-iPr2)(THF) 70was very active in the polymeriza-
tion of rac-lactide in THF, with stereoselectivity and rate of polymerization similar
to those observed for the amide complex 68.OO

In a more recent report, a novel dinuclear N,N,O-donor Schiff base–calcium
complex [(DAIP) 2Ca] 2where DAIP ¼2-[2(-dimethylamino-ethylimino)methyl]
phenol 76(Fig. 12) was shown to initiate ROP of L-lactide in a controlled fashion
in the presence of benzyl alcohol giving a 96% conversion within 30–60 min at
room temperature, yielding polymers with high molecular weight and low PDIs[89]. Taking into account the dimeric molecular structures of hexa- and hepta-
coordinated Ca
+2in the solid state and the kinetic results gained from this study
(ﬁrst order dependency on [LA]; a ﬁrst order dependency on [BnOH] with d[LA]/dt¼k
prop[LA][BnOH] and a kpropconstant of 1.95 M/C01s/C01), a coordinatio-
n–insertion commonly referred as “pseudo-anionic” polymerization mechanismcan be tentatively proposed for this reaction. Complex 76undergoes an equilibrium
involving THF and
L-lactide ( A) to form intermediate ( B) via the dissociation of a
dimethylamino group and attack of the benzyl alcohol at the lactide monomer asshown in Scheme 10.
Darensbourg and coworkers reported a systematic investigation of ROP catalyst
performance along with kinetic and mechanistic studies for the polymerization of
L- and rac-lactide using calcium complexes derived from tridentate Schiff base
ligands (Fig. 13)[90,91]. With calcium catalysts 77a–d , used in melt and solution
polymerization of L-lactide, it was found that calcium salen catalyst 77dwith bis
(phosphoranylidene)ammonium azide as a co-catalyst is much less active than the
calcium complexes with tridentate Schiff base ligands, as reﬂected in the monomer
L-lactide conversions of 59–80% for 77a–c but only 35% for 77d as initiator.

Similarly, a turn-over frequency (TON) of 227 of the polymerization process was
distinctly low for 77dwith [M]/[I] ¼350, at 110/C14C for 6 h, using “in the melt”
polymerization conditions. Biocompatible calcium complex 77aused as catalyst at
110/C14C produced in 30 min PLAs with high molecular weight (65,000–110,600)
and narrow polydispersities (1.02–1.05) using [M]/[I] ¼350–700. It is worthy of
note that complex 77adisplayed a notable heteroselectivity (probability of racemic
linkages between monomers, Pr¼0.73, see Sect. 4.2) in polymerization of rac-
lactide in THF at /C033/C14C. Data on the aforementioned calcium initiators and their
lactide polymerization are listed in Table 4.
3.3 Group 3 Metals (Sc, Y) and Lanthanides
Lanthanide-based catalysts, despite ﬁnding a lot of application in homogeneous
catalysis, can be rather problematic due to the lability of some ligand types and the
versatility of their coordination chemistry in the +3 oxidation state; this makes thecontrolled synthesis of “single-site” Ln
IIIcomplexes a quite ambitious goal [ 92].

[93]. Recently, rare-earth metal complexes have attracted considerable attention as
initiators for the preparation of PLA via ROP of lactides, and promising resultswere reported in most cases [ 94–100]. Group 3 members (e.g. scandium, yttrium)
and lanthanides such as lutetium, ytterbium, and samarium have been frequently
used to develop catalysts for the ROP of lactide. The principal objectives ofapplying rare-earth complexes as initiators for the preparation of PLAs were toinvestigate: (1) how the “spectator” ligands would affect the polymerizationdynamics (i.e., reaction kinetics, polymer composition, etc.), and (2) the relativecatalytic efﬁciency of lanthanide(II) and (III) towards ROPs.
From recent studies, a series of guanidine-supported alkoxide complexes
[Ln{(Me
3Si)2NC(N-iPr)2}2(OR)] (R ¼OtBu, Ln ¼Y, Nd, Sm, Lu; R ¼OiPr,
Ln¼Y, Nd, Lu) 78–84(Fig. 14)h a sb e e nf o u n dt ob ea c t i v ei nR O Po f rac-
lactide with a control of molecular weights signiﬁcantly tuned by the choice ofthe metal [ 101]. In particular, yttrium and lut etium featured a higher activity in
toluene than in THF due to the high oxophilic nature of lanthanides, resulting in acompetition between THF and the lactide monomer at the metal center. A decreas-ing order of activity (Nd /C25Sm>Y>Lu) in “immortal” polymerizations
suggests an apparent correlation with the ionic radii of the metals [ 102].
More recently reported was a bridged bis(amidinate)–isopropoxy ytterbium
complex 85(Fig. 14), which displayed excellent polymerization activity in con-
junction with a good control of the polymerization of
L-lactide with a linear
increases of polymer molecular weights ( Mn) with [M] 0/[I]0[103]. It was also
evidenced that 85was even more active in the polymerization of lactide than its
structural analog with bridging phenoxide group, as an isopropoxide is intrinsicallymore nucleophilic than a phenoxide.
A series of bis(thiophosphinic amido) yttrium complexes 86a–h was promising
due to their high rates and enhanced control of the

More recently, metal complexes with chelating b-ketiminates have been exam-
ined for ROP of lactide due to the ease of preparation and modiﬁcation of bothsteric and/or electronic properties. Thus, it is surprising that reports dealing with
rare-earth metal complexes of b-ketoiminate remained scarce before Yao and
coworkers investigated a series of dimeric aryloxide complexes [LLn(OAr)(THF)]
2(Ln¼Nd87,S m 88,Y b 89,Y90, and L ¼ligand) bearing a dianionic
N-aryloxo-functionalized b-ketominate (Fig. 15). It has been found that neodym-
ium and samarium aryloxo complexes were highly efﬁcient initiators for the ROPof
L-lactide, giving almost complete conversions in toluene in 4 h at 70/C14Ca t
[M] 0/[I]0¼400 [ 105]. In this case, a decrease in the ionic radii of the metal causes a
reduction in catalytic activity. The yield is 35% under the same polymerization
conditions using yttrium complex 90and only 40% using ytterbium complex 89as
the initiator, even when the molar ratio of monomer to initiator decreased to 100.
Yttrium bis(alkyl) and bis(amido) complexes of the type [LY(CH 2SiMe 3)2]
bearing N,O-multidentate ligands (L), such as b-diimines, displayed high activity
for the ROP of L-lactide at room temperature (100% conversion in most
experiments in THF within 2–60 min). In this case, an inﬂuence of the ligandframework and the geometry of the alkyl(amido) species (single site or double site)on the catalytic activity have been reported [ 106].
The catalytic properties toward
L-lactide of the divalent bimetallic lanthanide
complexes 91–97(Fig. 15), involving amine bis(phenolate) ligands, have been
investigated by Delbridge and coworkers, who showed that complexes 91, 95,
and97were active at 70/C14C[107]. An interesting case of metal radius-driven
enhancement of the ROP activity with L-lactide has been demonstrated recently
by Delbridge and coworkers for a series of ytterbium, samarium and lanthanumcomplexes bearing O,N,O-tridentate phenolate ligand (H
2L) with an aliphatic
alcohol as side arm. While ytterbium(III) complex 100displayed a fair activity to
polymerize L-lactide (moderate conversion 61% in 24 h at 80/C14C), complexes with
larger metals La(III) 98and Sm(III) 99in a similar steric environment (Fig. 12),
displayed a drastic increase in catalytic activity. Quantitative monomer conversionscould be readily achieved with catalyst precursor 98within 1 min at room

lactide:catalyst 98ratios from 100:1 up to 1000:1 also led to a complete conversion
to PLA at room temperature within 10 min [ 108].
The swift reaction of rare earths organometallic precursors like tris(alkyl)s, Ln
(CH 2SiMe 3)3(THF) 2with N,O,P-donor multidentate ligands (HL 1and HL 2) driven
by alkane elimination, afforded a series of metal (Ln ¼Y, Lu) alkyl complexes
101a ,band102a ,b. In this method, HL 1was deprotonated by the metal alkyl
whereas the imino C ¼N group was reduced by intramolecular alkylation,
generating THF-solvated mono-alkyl complexes ( 101a Ln¼Y;101b Ln¼Lu)
(Scheme 11). Using mono(alkyl) complexes 101a ,band101as initiators led to
complete conversions of L-lactide within 2 h at 20/C14C, whereas only 1 h was needed
when complexes 102a, b were the initiators under similar experimental conditions.
This is attributed to the coordination of THF molecules in complexes 101a, b . The
less reactive nature of complex 103 might be attributed to the coordination of
methoxy moieties, which played a similar role as THF in complexes 101a, b
[109]. The molecular weight of the resulting PLA increased with the monomer:
catalyst ratio while the molecular weight distribution showed no change, indicatinga controlled polymerization. In the case of bis(alkyl) complex 103as the initiator,
the molecular weight of PLA was halved compared to those obtained from the
reactions run with mono(alkyl) derivatives as initiators. This suggests that both
metal centers participated in the mechanism, leading to a resulting PLA withrelatively broader molecular weight distribution, probably due to a lower initiatingrate and a higher propagation rate.
A series of mono(amidinate) rare earth metal bis(alkyl) complexes ( 104–110) with
different amidinate ligands are shown in Fig. 16. The activity of the mono(amidinate)

revealed the efﬁciency of these initiators in the production of high molecular weightPLAs with moderate polydispersities ( <1.32) [ 110]. It has been found that the
polymerization rate is highly dependent upon the central metals with an activityincreasing from lutetium to neodymium: Lu >Y>Nd. For example, the lutetium
complex exhibited the highest activity within the range 107>106>108, which is
quite counterintuitive considering the order of the effective ionic radii Nd
3+
(1.123 A ˚)>Y3+(1.040 A ˚)>Lu3+(1.001 A ˚)[102].
Recently, tris- b-diketiminate lanthanide complexes [LnL 3X]( X ¼Cl, LCl:

115) (Scheme 12) displaying a high activity in producing PLAs under mild
conditions via ROP of L-lactide have been reported. This reactivity may be
attributed to the crowded coordination sphere around the central metal, which
incidentally affords an activated Ln–N( b-diketiminate) bond. The activity depends
on the central metals, and the active trend of Sm <Nd<Pr is consistent with the
sequence of the ionic radii [ 113].Nd(CH2SiMe3)2(μ−Cl)Li(THF)3N

Scheme 12 Ln initiator derived from b-diketiminate and ytterbium bisamide bridged bis
(phenolato) [ 113,114]252 S. Dutta et al.
A recent report on bimetallic ytterbium bis(amides) 116and117stabilized by a
ﬂexible bridged bis(phenolato) ligand claimed a straightforward polymerization of
L-lactide. The conversion is characterized by short reaction times (30 min to 2 h)
and PLAs displaying broad PDIs (1.71–2.24). The reason for the apparent enhance-
ment of the activity found in the bimetallic lanthanide amides is tentativelyexplained by cooperative effects within these bimetallic systems [ 114].
As discussed above, lanthanides and group 3 homoleptic complexes are attrac-
tive initiators because of their moderate Lewis acidities, good activities of poly-merization, and low toxicity [ 94,111,112,115–118]. A list of lanthanide initiators
and their polymerization activity is listed in Table 5.
The general issues from literature surveys dealing with lanthanide initiators
reveal the following: (1) catalyst precursors with larger lanthanide metals polymer-
ize lactide faster than metals of smaller radii, (2) lanthanide catalysts polymerizelactide at slower rates than cyclic esters such as e-caprolactone and, in most cases,

compared to what is commonly experienced in the ROP of lactides with anionic and
cationic initiators. The use of well-deﬁned, single-site rare-earth complexes asinitiators allows a higher stability and better solubility of the products, eventually
leading to a better control of the PLA production. The choice of the spectator
ligands to stabilize the metal center is paramount in obtaining an optimalperformance.
3.4 Group 4 Metals (Ti, Zr, Hf)
Titanium alkoxides are also effective and sought-after initiators for the ROP oflactides due to a low toxicity, which minimizes the problems linked to the presence
of catalyst residues in commercial PLA products [ 18,19]. Despite impressive
advancements in the use of Lewis acidic metal initiators in the preparation ofPLAs, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the group 4 metal (Ti, Zr, Hf)initiators, probably due to the highly oxophilic nature of M(IV) which has a naturaltendency to form alkoxy-bridged multinuclear complexes. Verkade and coworkerspreviously demonstrated a series of titanium alkoxide complexes 118–122(Fig. 17)
that function as moderately efﬁcient initiators in bulk homopolymeization of
L-lactide and rac-lactide, some of these initiators displaying a well-controlled
polymerization behavior [ 119].
Among the titanium catalysts 118–121, complexes 118 and119 are more
effective than complexes 120and121not only in bulk polymerization (Table 6)
but also in toluene solution (Table 7). Polymerization of lactide reaches >90%
yield within 4 h for 119, whereas only 55% yield was observed for 120. Although
the different ring sizes of tetradentate trisalkoxy- or trisaryloxyamine ligandsresulted in only minor structural changes in the Ti complexes, they give rise to amajor effect on their polymerization activity. For example, the characteristics of the
resulting polymers obtained in high yields with the ﬁve-membered ring systems
displayed higher molecular weights in comparison to the performance of six-membered ring systems. One of the reasons could be found in the greater stericprotection of the central titanium in 120and121. The region above the equatorial
plane is occupied by the alkyl substituents located on the six-membered rings,which prevent the formation of higher Ti-containing aggregates during thecoordination–insertion step. This assumption is supported by the fact that the less

sterically hindered complex 120 shows a greater catalytic activity and affords
polymers with higher molecular weights than with 121.
Recently, sulfur- and methylene-bridged chelating bis(aryloxo) titanium
complexes have been used as initiators for living polymerization of lactides[120–124]. Moreover, amino-bisphenols are one of the most employed ancillary
ligand type in developing titanium initiators for both bulk and solution phase ROPofrac- and
L-lactide [ 125]. In these cases, the properties of polymers obtained
varied widely depending on the geometry of the ancillary ligand and polymeriza-
tion conditions.
Alkoxo bridged titanium complexes [Ti 2(m-OEt) 2(EDBP) 2(OEt) 2]123and [Ti
(EDBP)(OiPr)2]124(Fig. 18) have chelating bis(aryloxo) ligands with an O–E–O
(E¼S, CH 2) bridge. In this series, the sulfur-bridged complex 124 displays a
trigonal bipyramidal geometry in the solid structure with a trans arrangement of the
sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This complex efﬁciently catalyzes the ROP in a con-trolled way, forming PLA of relatively narrow molecular weight distributions(PDI ¼1.23 and M
nof 20,400) at 100/C14C within 120 h [ 120]. Similarly, bis
(phenolate) titanium complexes 125and126(Fig. 15) are active in polymerization
ofL-lactide and rac-lactide in toluene at 70/C14C with [M] 0/[I]0¼100. Only 90%
conversion was reached after 2.5 h for complex 125, yielding PLA with Mnof
17,500 and PDI of 1.06. However, complex 126achieved 98% conversion in 1.2 h,
yielding polymer with similar molecular weight and molecular weight distribution(M
n¼18,000, PDI ¼1.08). The higher activity of 126compared to 125is proba-
bly due to a defragmentation of the dinuclear complex 125via lactide coordination.Table 6 Bulk polymerization of lactide at 130/C14C

The formation of the active mononuclear species prior to the polymerization
process induces a latency in the overall reaction. A tentative mechanism forpolymerization of lactides initiated by complex 125is proposed in Scheme 13,
where dinuclear species 125dissociates to a mononuclear species in the presence of
lactide [ 122].
To further improve the performances of titanium complexes, another
strategy has been employing titanium biphenoxy–alkoxide complexes of the form
L
nTi(OR) n/C04, in which OR is capable of initiating the polymerization and L is a
sterically bulky bisphenol ligand. These complexes were generally obtained by thereaction of Ti(OPr
i)4or Ti(OPri)3Cl with the corresponding bisphenol as shown in
Scheme 14[123]. Biphenolate complexes 127–132have been demonstrated to be
active initiators in the ROP of L-lactide in the bulk phase. The nature and steric bulk
of the phenolic ligands greatly inﬂuence the physical properties of the isolatedpolymer. In all cases, the PLA obtained displayed low molecular weights
(M
w¼4,670–9,170) and moderate polydispersities (1.5–1.7). An increase of reac-
tion temperature from 130/C14C to 180/C14C while maintaining other parameters
constant has demonstrated a marked increase of polymer molecular weight(M
w14,470). On the other hand, the inﬂuence of the biphenolate ligand or the
nature of the substituents located at the phenyl ring did not lead to any speciﬁc trendconcerning the molecular weights of the polymers. However, according to theauthors, a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution in most cases suggeststhe involvement of single-site catalysis. Nonetheless, the low molecular weights
and higher crystallinity of the obtained polymers are rather unique to these mixed
alkoxy-biphenolate catalysts.

performed as excellent initiators for the ROP of lactide, and their activities directly
correlated with the electronic effects of the substituents [ 124]. In contrast to
aluminum–salen initiators, electron-withdrawing substituents on the Schiff baseligand have a detrimental inﬂuence upon polymerization efﬁciency, whereas the use
of electron-donating alkoxy-functionality has allowed the highest recorded activity to
date for titanium initiators with salen ligands, displaying 86% conversion to PLA in8 h and 97% in 24 h. The molecular weight distributions of the resulting PLAs wererelatively narrow (1.11–1.21), suggesting a well-controlled propagation step consid-erably free from undesirable termination processes.
ROP of lactide to PLAs under solvent-free conditions is one of the major topics
of industrial interest, and where titanium initiators play an impressive role.Under solvent-free conditions, the use of a novel chlorotitanium calix[4]arene
complex 139(Fig. 20) as catalyst for the polymerization of
L- and rac-lactide has
been reported. This catalyst displayed a high activity depending on the monomer-to-catalyst molar ratio and led to highly isotactic PLLA. Despite concomitanttransesteriﬁcation reactions during the polymerization, the overall process waswell-controlled and the PDIs remained in the range of 1.2–1.4 [ 126]. The catalyst,
which is based on a diphenolate ligand substituted by electron-withdrawing NO

that are higher ( >99.9% conversion) than those obtained with other chlorotitanium
complexes. In this case, addition of n-butanol during polymerization signiﬁcantly
increases the polymerization activity (87.8 kg mol/C01(Ti) h/C01).
The selective synthesis of tri- and dichlorotitanium complexes 140–142bearing
chiral tridentate Schiff base ligands derived from (1 R,2S)-(/C0)-1-aminoindanol
(Fig. 20) has been recently reported. X-ray structural studies of these complexes
revealed a mononuclear feature with an octahedral coordination sphere at the metalcenter, and a meridional occupation of the Schiff base. Surprisingly, though thesecomplexes lack the typical ROP-initiating units such as alkoxides or amides, theyare effective catalysts for the controlled ROP of
L-lactide, as evidenced by the
linearity of the molecular weight versus [ L-LA]:[Ti] ratio as well as the narrow PDIs
(1.17–1.33) [ 127].
Besides Schiff base ligands, the utilization of sulfonamide-zirconium catalysts
has been described for the ROP of rac-lactide both in toluene at 100/C14C and in the
melt at 130/C14C to produce atactic poly( rac-lactide) [ 128]. The polymerization rates
and control achieved for complexes 143and144derived from multidentate N 4- and
N3O-donor sulfonamides were high, 144 showing signiﬁcantly more activity
to give a 95% conversion in toluene at 70/C14C, with a ﬁrst order consumption of
rac-lactide ( kp¼0.0076(2) min/C01). Complex 144 gives a 94% conversion and
PLA of Mn8,290 g mol/C01with, unfortunately, a poor control of the regioselectivity
producing atactic PLAs from rac-lactide. The polymerization ran in the melt and
led to a high conversion (90%) of 50–300 equiv. of rac-lactide in 30 min at 130/C14C
and to isopropoxy-terminated polymers with Mnup to 42,430 g mol/C01(PDI ¼1.49),
e.g., 300 equiv.of rac-lactide. Even though the polymers obtained from a melt had
broader PDIs than those obtained from a polymerization in solution, the activityof complex 144under melt conditions was superior to most of the bis(phenolate)
systems involving titanium and zirconium and gave up to 75% conversion in a 2 hL2ZrO

reaction time [ 129]. Polymerization activity of these zirconium systems is also
comparable to tris(phenolate) systems, which give up to 50% (Ti) or 95% yield (Hf)after 0.5 h, and 78% yield after 0.1 h (Zr) for [ rac-LA]:[Ti/Hf-trisphenolate] ¼300
[130].
A strong demand for catalys ts having a low toxicity has focused the develop-
ment of zirconium(IV) ROP systems. Along these lines, zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate [Zr(acac)
4] was introduced as initiator for the polymerization and
copolymerization of lactide and glycolide (vide infra) and seemed very promisingfor the production of high molecular weight polymers [ 131]. Later, the results
gained from the Zr(acac)
4-catalyzed lactide polymerization and from molecular
modeling calculations revealed a ligan d exchange between lactide and acac in
solution, acac playing a key role owing to its lability within this system [ 132].

optical rotation of the polymer ( aDat 25/C14Cw a s /C01 5 5 )a n ds h o w i n gn or a c e m i -

Amongst the few reports on the utilization of well-deﬁned zirconium catalysts
for the ROP of lactides, a rare example of a metallocene derivative, Ph 2C(Cp)(Flu)
Zr[OC(OiPr)CMe 2]2145 (Fig. 20), and the investigation of the general chain
transfer mechanism of the zirconocene systems have been reported [ 133]. Interest-
ingly, among the studied zirconocenes derivatives, the complex displaying a Cs-
symmetry, 145, is considerably more active ( >100-fold rate enhancement in
toluene at 80/C14C) than the zirconium complexes displaying a C2-symetry with
chiral motif and a C2v-symetry with achiral structural features like the zirconocene
bis(ester enolate) complex. Polymerization results with complex 145showed some
interesting trends, e.g., operating at a low [ L-LA]/[Zr] ratio (around 50) leads to
living characteristics and a linear relationship of Mnversus monomer conversion,
the molecular weight distribution remaining narrow (PDI ¼1.18–1.25) for all
conversions. The calculated initiator efﬁciency Ivalues (based on one chain
produced per Zr center) ranged from 92% to 102% for conversions below 46%,implying that only one of the two enolate ligands is used for the chain initiation. Asmonomer conversion increases, the Ivalue does the same (up to 115% at 92%
conversion), suggesting either a small degree of chain transfer occurring at the latestage of polymerization or the possibility of a small percentage of initiation by thesecond enolate ligand coordinated to Zr. The polymerization by 145follows strictly
ﬁrst order kinetics with respect to monomer concentration for all ﬁve [
L-LA]/[Zr]
ratios investigated.
Recently, dithio-diolate ligands have been employed for construction of group
4 metal catalysts for the ROP of lactide. These metal dithiolate complexes formmononuclear species of the type [(OSSO)M(OR)
2] with an octahedrally coordi-
nated metal center. These ﬂuxional compounds acted as highly active catalysts inthe ROP of
L- and rac-lactide. Hafnium complexes were also introduced as
initiators for the ROP of L-lactide and rac-lactide (vide infra) in very limited
cases. To our knowledge, the hafnium derivative 146displayed the highest activity
among the group 4 catalysts reported to date (complete conversion of 300 equiv. of260 S. Dutta et al.
rac-lactide within 1 min under solvent-free melt conditions) [ 134]. A mixed
substituted pyrrolyl-tetra-pyrrolyl hafnium aryloxide complex [C 4H3N
(CH 2NMe 2)2]2Hf(OR) 2147(R¼C6H3-2,6-iPr2) (Fig. 20) was described in one
of the limited reports dealing with hafnium. This compound initiates the polymeri-
zation of rac-lactide in CDCl 3at 70/C14C following a ﬁrst order rate with respect to
the monomer concentration [ 135].
3.5 Group 13 Metals (Al, In)
The central role of the metal can be clearly seen in the polymerization activity of
aluminum catalysts, which is sometime lower than that of related magnesium andzinc initiators, despite a higher Lewis acidity. Many well-deﬁned aluminumalkoxides and cationic Al complexes have been explored in ROP of lactide [ 136].
These initiators are commonly designed with ligands involving diamines,
porphyrins, ketiminates, diketiminates, and diols such as biphenolates andmethylenebiphenolates. Importantly, a large number of aluminum initiators, includ-ing chiral or achiral fragments, have demonstrated highly controlled ROPs of
L-and
rac-lactide. However, the rate of the polymerization reactions with most of the
aluminum complexes is generally slow and requires high temperatures (70–100/C14C)
over a relatively long period of time.
In the past, several aluminum–alkyl, halide, and alkoxide complexes supported
by multidentate ligands were examined for their catalytic lactide polymerization
activities. To this end, monomeric aluminum complexes 148a ,b(Fig. 21) were
synthesized in our laboratory for producing polyesters with thiolate end groups[137]. These complexes initiated polymerizations under reﬂux condition in toluene
and xylene forming PLAs with narrow molecular weight distributions (PDIs1.15–1.25).
Aluminum porphyrins 149a, b (Fig. 21) were demonstrated by Inoue and
coworkers [ 138,139] to give PLAs with expected molecular weights and narrow
PDIs (<1.25) at 100
/C14C. Notably, one equivalent of lactide inserted into the Al–OR
bond of complex 149b demonstrated that the polymerization proceeds at the
acyl–oxygen bond, as evidenced by the1H NMR data. Studies of kinetics on the
related systems revealed that the polymerization follows a second order rate lawwith respect to the concentration of Al complex, suggesting that the propagationinvolves two aluminum porphyrins, one as a nucleophilic species involved in chaingrowth and the other as a Lewis acidic monomer activator.
Bertrand and coworkers reported a series of neutral and cationic aluminum
complexes involving triamine ligands, in which complexes 150a –c(Fig. 21)
acquired monomeric forms as revealed by X-ray structural studies [ 140]. Due to
the formation of a rather rigid bicyclic core, the tridentate ligand enforced anapproximately trigonal monopyramidal coordination geometry around the alumi-num, the empty axial coordination site playing the role of the reactive site duringthe polymerization. In all of the complexes, only the methyl and hydridoaluminumRecent Developments in Metal-Catalyzed Ring-Opening Polymerization 261
derivatives 150a, b were able to initiate the polymerization of rac-lactide in
benzene at 80/C14C, forming PLAs with PDIs of 1.79 and 1.61, respectively. The
hydrido-complex 150b was about twice as active as the methylaluminum derivative
150a . Interestingly, dimeric aluminum complexes 151a ,band152 have been
activated with propylene oxide or cyclohexene oxide to improve their lactidepolymerization activity, as these complexes on their own displayed a poor perfor-mance in polymerization of rac-lactide in toluene at 70
/C14C and gave distinctly low
conversions (5–11%) even after 7 days [ 141]. After the addition of a stoichiometric
quantity of propylene oxide or cyclohexene oxide, the correspondingchloroalkoxide species obtained via an insertion of propylene oxide into the
[Al]–Cl bond was able to catalyze more efﬁciently the polymerization of lactide
to reach completion after 18 h at 70
/C14C in toluene, giving PLAs with expected
molecular weights and narrow PDIs (1.13–1.27).
Comparative study of the ROP activity within this set of Al complexes revealed
that [Al]–Me complex 151c is a poor initiator for the polymerization of rac-lactide
(58% conversion in 168 h). This is in strong contrast to the ROP activity of thecatalyst generated by the alcoholysis of Al–alkyl complex with chloroethanol,which was considerably more active and gave high levels of conversion comparable
to those obtained with 151a / propylene oxide, 151b / propylene oxide, 152/ propyl-
ene oxide after 18 h. It is worth noting that the molecular weights and PDIs of theresulting PLAs were similar to those obtained with catalysts formed by activation of151a ,band152with propylene oxide.
Indium reagents increasingly gain importance in organic transformations
because of their rich reactivity proﬁle and remarkable stability against water[142–144]. Surprisingly, structurally well-deﬁned indium complexes have been
scarcely investigated as catalysts of the ROP of lactide. Recently, Okuda and
coworkers reported a tetradentate (OSSO)-ligand that afforded well-deﬁned indium
complexes able to initiate the ROP of
L- and rac-lactide (vide infra) [ 145]. Both the
indium isopropoxy complexes [In(etbbp)(OiPr)] 153 and [In(etccp)(OiPr)] 154

cient in polymerizing L-lactide in a controlled fashion to form isotactic PLAs with
narrow molecular weight distribution (PDI ¼1.03–1.18).
3.6 Miscellaneous Metal Initiators
For the large scale production of PLAs, the bulk ROP of L-lactide in the presence of
a metal catalyst under solvent-free melt conditions is preferred over the solutionpolymerization using metal initiators in many cases [ 146,147]. Despite achieving a
greater polymerization control in solution, these catalysts often suffer from certain
limitations like a high sensitivity to impurities and a high reactivity that yieldsvarious unwanted side reactions such as racemization and transesteriﬁcation [ 148].
In this context, the bulk polymerization under solvent-free conditions often plays amajor role for the large scale production of PLAs. Apart from the conventionalmetal initiators (Zn, Al, Mg), constant efforts have been undertaken to developalternative catalytic systems for PLA production in melt conditions. Recentinvestigations of the ROP activity of catalysts containing, e.g., nickel, copper,
and gold show the inﬂuence of the diverse coordination geometries on the poly-
merization activity both in bulk and in solution. In these studies, Schiff-base ligandsplay a pivotal role in the development of new catalytic systems owing to an overalleasy synthesis and a high versatility of the ligand architecture (tuning thesubstituents in the ligand to inﬂuence the steric and electronic speciﬁcs of theligand). Schiff bases were used with a wide range of metal complexes in polymeri-zation screening using lactide as substrate. Schiff-bases based on salicylidene and
L-aspartic acid yielded a broad range of metal complexes of the general type
K[ML] nH2O, where M ¼Cu(II), Zn(II), Co(II), Ni(II); n¼2, 2, 3, and 3.5 respec-
tively; and H 3L¼L-aspartic acid–salicylidene Schiff base [ 149]. These
compounds are active in the polymerization of D,L-lactide in melt condition and
yield polymers displaying molecular weights somewhat lower than the PLAsproduced by M(acac)
2(M¼Zn, Co, Ni) [ 150]. However, salicylidene and
L-aspartic acid complexes are soluble in D,L-lactide melts to form homogenousOH

polymerization media in which all conversions reach more than 90%, as listed in
Table 8. The relatively low Mnof the isolated PLAs may be related to the use of
hydrated Cu, Co, and Ni complexes, the residual water acting as a transfer agent
able to restrain the polymer chain lengths.
In this process, both conversion of monomers and the molecular weights ( Mn)o f
the PLAs increase within 12 h, with a characteristic slow initiation and “long-living” active species. These results are analogous to those for the bulk polymeri-zation of
D,L-lactide at high temperature (130/C14C). Although monomer conversion
gradually increases with the reaction time, the molecular weight of PLA decreasesconsequently, leading to the degradation of PLA, as already found in the case of themetal acetylacetonates M(acac)
2(M¼Zn, Co, Ni).
Recent reports on Cu+2or Ni+2complexes of phenoxy-ketimine ligands revealed
that Cu+2, with a distorted square-planar coordination geometry, efﬁciently
catalyzed the ROP of lactide at elevated temperature under solvent-free conditions.In contrast, the Ni
+2counterparts yielded PLAs that had a perfect square-planar
geometry around the metal center [ 151]. Comparative catalytic efﬁciency of a
series of Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes, 155a ,b,156a –c(Fig. 23), derived from
phenoxy-ketimine ligands revealed the perfect square-planar nickel centers in 155a ,
band square-planar copper in 156a ,cand a distorted square-planar arrangement in
156b . ROP results revealed that the copper complexes 156a –cefﬁciently catalyzed
polymerization of L-lactide at elevated temperatures under solvent-free melt
conditions at [M]/[I] ¼50, producing PLAs with moderate molecular weights
(10,400–18,500) and narrow molecular weight distributions (PDI ¼1.05–1.58).
Novel gold and silver N-heterocyclic carbenes, [3-( N-tert -butylacetamido)-1-

1-(2-hydroxy-cyclohexyl) imidazol-2-ylidene]AuCl 158 (Fig. 23) successfully
catalyzed the ROP of L-lactide at elevated temperatures under melt conditions to
produce moderate to low molecular weight PLAs with narrow molecular weight
distribution [ 152]. Surprisingly, although a gold–carbon bond (76.3 kcal/mol) is
signiﬁcantly stronger than a silver–carbon bond (53.1 kcal/mol) in N-heterocycliccarbene (NHC)–MCl complexes, polymers with comparable molecular weightswere obtained in the presence of both 157 (M

This broad set of Au–NHC initiators offers the possibility to investigate the effectof the functionalization of the NHC on the ROP activity, and also the effect ofmodifying the ancillary N-heterocyclic ring by changing from an imidazole- to abenzimidazole-NHC backbone, as in the case of 160[153].
4 Stereocontrolled ROP of rac- and meso -lactides
The mechanical properties of PLA rely on the stereochemistry of insertion of
the lactide monomer into the PLA chain, and the process can be controlled by thecatalyst used. Therefore, PLAs with desired microstructures (isotactic, heterotactic,and syndiotactic) can be derived from the rac- and meso -lactide depending on the
stereoselectivity of the metal catalysts in the course of the polymerization(Scheme 15)[66]. Fundamentally, two different polymerization mechanisms can
be distinguished: (1) chain-end control (depending on stereochemistry of the
monomer), and (2) enantiomorphic site control (depending on chirality of the
catalyst). In reality, stereocontrolled lactide polymerization can be achieved witha catalyst containing sterically encumbered active sites; however, both chain-endand site control mechanisms may contribute to the overall stereocontrol [ 154].

1H decoupling of the methyl signal is performed, resulting in singlet resonances in
the methine region ( d¼5.15–5.25 ppm). According to Bernoullian statistics, PLA
derived from rac- and meso -lactide possesses ﬁve tetrad sequences in relative ratios
that are determined by the stereoselectivity of the catalyst [ 66]. The degree of
stereoregularity of PLA is quantiﬁed by coefﬁcients PmandPrassociated with
the probability of racemic (r) or meso (m) linkages between monomer units,respectively. Generally, the stereosequences of the afforded PLAs are assignedfrom the deconvoluted homonuclear decoupled
1H NMR (Fig. 25)[70] and13C
NMR spectra [ 156,157] as described by Coates [ 66,158] and Hillmyer [ 155]
independently.
For determining the isotacticity of PLAs, the Pmvalues are calculated from (area of
mmm tetrad)/(total area in the methine proton region) obtained from homodecoupled
1H NMR spectra of the resulting PLA. Isotacticity of PLAs can also be determined
from the following relations between Pmand intensity of the tetrads: [mmm] ¼Pm2+
(1/C0Pm)Pm/2; [mmr] ¼[rmm] ¼(1/C0Pm)Pm/2; [rmr] ¼(1/C0Pm)2/2; and
[mrm] ¼[(1/C0Pm)2+Pm(1/C0Pm)]/2. Similarly, for heterotacticity, Prvalues are
calculated from (area of mrm and rmr tetrads)/(total area in methine proton region)obtained from homodecoupled
1H NMR spectra (Fig. 25)[70]. Heterotacticity of
PLAs is also connected with the following relations between Prand intensity of the
tetrads: [mmm] ¼[2(1/C0Pr)2+Pr(1/C0Pr)]/2; [mrm] ¼[Pr2+Pr(1/C0Pr)]/2;
[mmr] ¼[rmm] ¼[Pr(1/C0Pr)]/2; and [rmr] ¼Pr2/2. Differences in tacticity alter
the polymer melting ( Tm) and glass transition ( Tg) temperatures such that heterotactic
PLA displays a Tm(130/C14C) and no observable Tg; enantiopure poly( L-lactide) (PLLA)
possesses Tg~50/C14Ca n d Tm¼180/C14C; and a 50:50 mixture of PLLA and poly( D-

increased Tm(ca. 230/C14). This increased melting transition is attributed to a
stereocomplex microstructure [ 159]. Isotactic and syndiotactic polymers are typically
crystalline materials with a characteristic high melting transition temperatures ( Tm
¼170–180/C14C). This makes isotactic PLAs attractive targets from the rac-lactide.
4.1 Isotactic-Enriched PLA from rac-Lactide
Spassky and coworkers discovered a remarkable stereocontrol of an
enantiomerically pure Al complex ( R)-161a for the ROP of rac-lactide resulting
in a tapered stereoblock PLA microstructure with high melting point ( Tm¼187/C14C)
(Fig. 26)[160]. Structurally analogous, racemic salen–Al complex 162resulted in
highly isotactic PLA [ 161]. Feijen’s enantiopure chiral complex ( R,R)-163(Fig. 26)
exhibited an excellent reverse stereocontrol by preferential polymerization of
L-lactide over D-lactide monomer ( KSS/KRR¼14) that resulted in PLA with

enhanced thermal stability and a high Pm(0.93) [ 162]. Nomura and coworkers
reported an achiral Al–salen complex 164that preferred highly stereoblock PLA
with high isotactic selectivity ( Pm¼0.91) [ 163]. A structurally similar achiral
Al–salen complex 165/2-propanol offered isotactic selectivity ( Pm¼0.90) [ 164].
Mehrkhodavandi and coworkers demonstrated moderate isotactic preference(P
m¼0.62) of a N,N,O-donor Schiff base-supported racemic indium complex
166 [165]. Arnold et al. reported a racemic homochiral C3-symmetric complex
YL3[L¼(tBu) 2P(O)CH 2CH(tBu)-OH] 167 that offered isotactic preference
for the resulting PLA [ 166]. A rac-indium complex (InL 3) with chiral L ligand
[L¼(tBu) 2P(O)CH 2CH(tBu)-OH] exhibited moderate isotactic selectivity
(Pm¼0.63) [ 167].
A series of pseudo- Csor pseudo- C2symmetric complexes 168–171(Fig. 27)
exhibited isotactic predominance ( Pm¼0.50–0.75); however, the isotacticity is
compromised in solvent-free bulk polymerization at 130/C14C[129]. Fluorous tertiary
alcohol ligands with electron-withdrawing CF 3group are weakly basic and thus
expected to reduce the possibility of catalyst deactivation by bridged speciesformation. Al complexes 172and173offered highly isotactic-enriched stereoblock
PLA ( P

4.2 Heterotactic-Enriched PLA from rac-Lactide
Coate’s achiral b-diiminate zinc complexes 34–36(Fig. 28)[66] produced
heterotactic-enriched PLA by a chain-end control mechanism. In this process,changing an isopropyl substituent to ethyl resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease inheteroselectivity from P
r¼0.90–0.79 [ 66]. Chisholm and coworkers reported
calcium tris-pyrazolyl borate complexes (TptBu)CaX 68, 70 that offered high
heterotactic selectivity ( Pr¼0.90) [ 88]. Gibson and coworkers demonstrated
heterotactic preference ( Pr¼0.80–0.96) with achiral tetradentate N,N0-disubsti-
tuted bis(aminophenoxide) (salan) aluminum complexes 174a–d [169]. We
reported magnesium and zinc complexes [(L) 2M2(m-OBn) 2]( L - H ¼(Z)-4-{[2-

heteroselective preference ( P
r¼0.81–0.87) at 30/C14C in THF (Fig. 28)[70]. A
dramatic temperature- and solvent-dependent variation of heteroselectivity(P
r¼0.87–0.64) was offered by complex 45. The corresponding Zn complex 46
showed a solvent-dependent hetereoselection ( Pr¼0.81) at /C030/C14Ci nC H 2Cl2.
Dinuclear complex [(SalenMe)Zn(OBn)] 255 afforded hetero-enriched
(Pr¼0.75) PLA at 25/C14Ci nC H 2Cl2[79]. Analogous zinc complexes 52a–e
(Fig. 28) exhibited a heteroselectivity ( Pr¼0.59–0.74), which increased with the
steric restrain [ 76]. Consequently, a dramatic temperature-dependent increase in
heteroselectivity ( Pr¼0.86) at 0/C14C and ( Pr¼0.91) at /C055/C14C was demonstrated.
Furthermore, heteroselective polymerization of rac-lactide ( Pr0.82) has been
demonstrated with complex 175 in solvent-free conditions (Fig. 28)[170].
Complexes 176–178(Fig. 29) have exhibited heterotactic selectivity resulting in
hetero-enriched PLA ( Pr¼0.87) [ 171]. Complexes 179a–d (Fig. 29) have
displayed moderate to high (~80%) heteroselectivity [ 172–174]. The conforma-
tionally ﬂexible cumyl (2, 2-dimethylbenzyl, R1) group in complexes 179b ,c

responsible for remarkably high heteroselectivities ( Pr¼0.95–0.99) [ 175]. Among
complexes 181a–c (Fig. 29),181a demonstrated a strikingly heterotactic
(Pr¼0.95) preference [ 176]. Hillmyer and Tolman’s indium trichloride/benzyl
alcohol/triethylamine catalytic system produced heterotactic PLA (0.92 <Pr
<0.94 at 25/C14C,Pr¼0.97 at 0/C14C) (Scheme 16)[177]. The chiral Schiff bases
complexes 182a–d (Fig. 30) exhibited moderate heteroselectivity ( Pr¼0.68–0.76)
[178]. Complexes 183and184(Fig. 30) demonstrated remarkable heteroselectivity
(Pr¼0.88–0.96) under melt conditions [ 130]. Complexes 185a–d, containing
natural amino acid-derived Schiff base ligands (based on L-phenylalanine, L-leu-
cine, and L-methionine) (Fig. 30) offered a temperature-dependent heteroselectivity
(Pr¼0.68–0.83) at 22/C14C, which further increased to 0.85–0.89 at /C030/C14C[179].
Al-complexes 186a–f /propan-2-ol offered mixed stereoselection ( Pm0.66 and
0.62 by 186a, d , respectively; Pr0.55 and 0.57 by 186c ,f, respectively) [ 180].
Interestingly, 186b /propan-2-ol afforded heterotactic PLAs ( Pr¼0.64). The
heterotacticity of ROP increased to 0.73 with 186e/ propan-2-ol. Amine-terminated,
highly heterotactic-enriched ( Pr¼0.93) PLA was afforded by a living and immor-
tal ROP initiator 187in the presence of BnNH 2at room temperature [ 181].

Coates and Ovitt reported ROP of meso -lactide catalyzed by a chiral aluminum

5 Poly(glycolide) and Poly(lactide- co-glycolide)
PGA and copolymers of glycolides are intensively studied and widely applied
biodegradable polymers. PLGA derived from glycolide has found therapeuticapplications such as drug delivery systems, ﬁxation of bones and joints, medicalscrews and pins etc. because these polyester materials are such that they do not needto be removed after implantation and the risk of adverse reaction due to long-termimplantation is also minimized [ 182–185]. PLA copolymers have been prepared via
the ROP of
L-lactide with tin(II) octoate (SnOct 2) in combination with a co-initiator.
SnOct 2serves as the standard initiator for many commercial purposes and it offers
an epimerization-free polymerization in the melt at temperatures up to 180/C14C.
However, the cytotoxicity of SnOct 2and the required extensive puriﬁcation of the
catalyst from the polyester materials render this method time-consuming. There-fore, metal salts and well-deﬁned complexes that exhibit excellent performance forROP of lactide with a low level of toxicity are preferred for the production of PGAand PLGA.
Earlier, Ca(acac)
2was employed as initiator to obtain a high molecular weight
homopolymer and copolymers of glycolide and lactide at 150/C14C[186]. Interest-
ingly, due to the high melting temperature of PGA blocks, copolymerization
reactions proceed in a heterogeneous liquid monomer suspension of polymer. Forthe above case, the high molecular weight of resulting PGA was conﬁrmed bydifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC trace presented in Fig. 31a has a
characteristic pattern for a PGA in which the thermogram exhibits only the endo-thermic peak at 225
/C14C due to melting, whereas the glass transition temperature is

above 34/C14C. In the case of low molecular weight PGA, the additional signal of
crystallization is prominent.
It follows that in the initial step of the reaction mainly glycolide units are
inserted in the growing polymer chain, resulting in the formation of copolymer
bearing long glycolide blocks. Then, chain growth is accompanied by a decrease inthe average block length, as well as by an increase in the content of lactyl units. Thisprocess needs a prolonged reaction time (9 days) to eventually give nearly 100%copolymer. The average lengths of lactidyl and glycolidyl blocks were close tothose of the respective blocks in the copolymer prepared with zinc lactate (ZnLac
2)
initiator [ 187]. In general, ZnLac 2is considered as a suitable replacement of the Na-,
K-, Mg-, and Ca-based initiators that deprotonate glycolide and lactide at the
a-position, resulting in the racemization of starting L-lactide and low molecular
weight copolyesters [ 188]. When compared to other fully resorbable zinc salts,
ZnLac 2proved to be the most active polymerization catalyst in the bulk at 150/C14C
and allows the formation of 1:1 copolyester materials. These copolymers arecompletely soluble in dichloromethane or chloroform because the average blocklength of the glycolic units is below 4.0. However, it is noteworthy that the initialquantity of the glycolide in a copolymerization process plays an important role incontrolling the monomer sequences and physical properties of the resulting
copolyesters. A rapid polymerization rate of glycolide causes a superheating of
the reaction mixture in the ﬁrst stage of the copolymerization process, and thisfavors an intensive transesteriﬁcation, which results formation of copolyesters withshorter glycolic blocks. However, in the case of Ca(acac)
2, the average lengths of
lactidyl and glycolidyl blocks were nearly twice those of the corresponding blocksof the copolymer obtained with SnOct
2(Table 9)[189]. This suggests a lower
degree of transesteriﬁcation, exhibited in –GLG– sequences, during the copolymer-ization in the presence of Ca(acac)
2than in the case of tin derivatives.
Microstructures of PLGAs have been quantitatively analyzed from their13C and
1H NMR spectral pattern.13C NMR displays the simplest diad sequences in the

carbonyl region and glycolide/ L-lactide copolymers obtained in the presence of
Ca(acac) 2exhibit ﬁve well-resolved signals arising from the following monomer
sequences: LLGG, LLLL, GGGG, GGLL where L stands for the lactyl ( /C0CH
(CH 3)–CO–O–) unit, and G designates the glycolyl (–CH 2–CO–O–) unit, and
an additional sequence GLG resulting from transesteriﬁcation side reactions(Fig. 31)[186].
The distribution of structural units depends exclusively on the contribution of
comonomers to the copolymer chain. Experimental average lengths of lactidyl and
glycolidyl blocks can be calculated from the relative intensity of the signalscorresponding to different diad sequences assigned in
13C NMR spectra (Fig. 32)
and from the equations (1) and (2) ( IGL/C0GL,ILA/C0LA,IGL/C0LA, and ILA/C0GLare the

Due to the formation of a rather rigid bicyclic core, tridentate nitrogen donors
enforce an approximately trigonal-pyramidal coordination geometry around themetal, and the empty axial coordination site has been used for promoting theROP of
D,L-lactide. For the production of PGA in a bulk method, a series of well-
deﬁned catalysts have been investigated of which an intramolecularly stabilizedstannylene 188, and related dimeric zinc complex 189featuring a central (Zn-N)
2
four-membered ring (Fig. 33) were important [ 190,191]. Structural differences in
these initiators have been attributed to the geometry enforced by the diamidoaminoligand, which probably favors a bent arrangement (in the case of 188) rather than a
linear, allenic-type geometry (as would be expected for the hypothetical monomericform of the zinc derivative). The samarium complex 190also adopts a dimeric
structure with chlorine bridges, retaining one coordinated THF molecule per metal[191]. Complexes 188–190 were active for the bulk copolymerization of (
D,L)-
lactide and glycolide with an order of improving ROP activity Zn <Sm<Sn.
The most active tin complex 188allows a conversion higher than 95% of glycolide
(342 equiv. of glycolide) in 2 h at 140/C14C and in 30 min at 180/C14C, however, at the
expense of the relatively broad molecular weight distribution (PDI ~ 3 at 180/C14C
and 2 at 140/C14C). Samarium derivative 190 give high conversions of both the
monomers with a stoichiometric mixture of ( D,L)-lactide and glycolide at 160/C14C
for 3.5 h.
Bismuth salts or complexes are outstanding candidates for glycolide–lactide
copolymerization due to low toxicity and, in some cases, Bi+3initiators performed
even better than Zn+2systems [ 192]. Bi salts and complexes have been applied for
the copolymerization of glycolide and L-lactide in bulk at 100–160/C14C, in which
the catalytic efﬁciency of SnOct 2and bismuth(III) n-hexanoate (BiHex 3) were
comparable. BiHex 3proved to be nearly as efﬁcient an initiator as SnOct 2and
the copolymer sequences were somewhat closer to randomness than those obtainedwith SnOct
2, producing amorphous copoly(ester)s [ 193]. However, a slight differ-
ence in polydispersities was noted for the copolymerizations in the presence ofBiHex
3and SnOct 2. The average lengths of the blocks determined by13C-NMR
spectroscopic analysis of the homogeneous blocks (L GLand L LA) are listed in
Table 10[193].N

Trends indicate that average lengths of both glycolidyl blocks and lactidyl blocks
decrease with an increase in polymerization temperatures and that the block lengths
of the BiHex 3-initiated PLGA were slightly lower than those obtained in the presence
of SnOct 2. A few copolymerization runs were performed with BiSS (subsalicylate)
and tetra(ethylene glycol) (TEG) as co-initiator to investigate their role in ROP.It was found that BiHex
3is a monomeric species soluble in numerous polar solvents
including lactones. In contrast, BiSS is insoluble in all organic solvents due to itscomplex polymeric network. Consequently, in the course of the copolymerizationonly a minor fraction of BiSS seemingly dissolved in the reaction mixture. Thoughthe performances of BiHex
3(and BiSS) are quite similar to that of SnOct 2,t h e ya r e
achieved with a much lower level of toxicity, which is a major issue.
o-Aluminum alkoxide [ 194] has been used as macroinitiator for glycolide
polymerization in THF at 40/C14C and in preparation of poly(LA- b-GA) diblock
copolymer by sequential polymerization of the lactide and glycolide. The resultingPLGA copolyesters have been fractionated by the use of a selective solvent for eachblock and characterized by
1H NMR spectroscopy and DSC analysis. The living
nature of the operative coordination–insertion mechanism is responsible for thecontrol of the copolyester composition, the length of the blocks, and the thermal
behavior. Because of the inherent insolubility of the PGA blocks, microphase
separation occurs during the course of the sequential polymerization, resulting instable, colloidal, non-aqueous copolymer dispersion, as conﬁrmed by photon cor-relation spectroscopy [ 194].
Earlier, ROP of glycolide and
D,L-lactide through precipitation was carried out in
nontoxic supercritical CO 2in the presence of SnOct 2as initiator and copoly(ester)
poly( D,L-lactide- co-glycolide) (PLGA), which can be easily separated fromTable 10 Comparison of the copolymerization of lactide and glycolide in bulk by SnOct 2and

the polymer by reducing the pressure of the solvent-polymer phase [ 195]. The
13C NMR analysis of the copolymer revealed a lactide-to-glycolide comonomer
ratio of 70.7:29.3, which was determined using the integrals of the methylene13C
signals of the lactide and of the glycolide units. A disadvantage in using CO 2as the
continuous phase for a precipitation polymerization is that low degrees of polymeri-zation often result from precipitation polymerizations of amorphous, CO
2-phobic
polymers. Under the present reaction conditions, despite limitations in molecularweight, a novel ring-opening precipitation polymerization of the PLGA in supercriti-cal CO
2has been developed [ 195]. Because of the lack of organic solvent and the
ability to extract unreacted monomer, this polymerization technique has the potentialto form high purity PLGA for biomedical applications.
More recently, the potential of ZnOct
2has been examined for the copolymeriza-
tion of D,L-lactide and glycolide in supercritical CO 2(scCO 2) for the purpose of
developing new supercritical technology for the production of biodegradable poly-meric microparticles for use as tunable vectors in the release of medicine. The PLGAcopoly(ester) obtained with ZnOct
2has similar characteristics to that obtained with
SnOct 2[196]. The inﬂuence of several operating parameters on the properties of the
resulting polymer and on mechanisms such as reaction time, pressure, and stirringrate is summarized in Table 11. The main advantage of ZnOct
2is its low toxicity
level, which makes it a suitable substitute for SnOct 2. Qualitatively, it can be
expected that the monomers are only slightly soluble in scCO 2and it would be
expected that the solubility of the monomers and low molecular weight compoundsincreases with pressure. This advantage, together with the use of “green” solvents,make the process a promising technology for achieving biocompatible polymers formedical applications. It has been proved that stirring rate and pressure exert aninﬂuence on the suspension and dispersion of the polymer phase and can produce asigniﬁcant change in the polymer molecular weight and morphology.

6 Conclusions and Remarks
The decade has witnessed a rapidly increasing number of metal catalysts, mainly
Mg, Zn, Al, Ti, and lanthanides for the metal-catalyzed ROP of lactide andglycolide. This also applies to their application in the production of homopolymerssuch as PLA, PGA, and PLGA copolymer, which are the major components ofcommodity bioplastics. As a result, a large pool of new ligands in combination withvarious metal precursors have been designed and synthesized to control the molec-ular weight, molecular weight distribution, and tacticity of the resulting polymers.Initiators such as lithium-alkoxides and aggregates have certainly proved to be
amazingly efﬁcient at producing PLAs with narrow molecular weight distributions.
Crucially, zinc and magnesium initiators have been the most widely investigatedsystems because of their biologically benign nature and their potential uses inbiomedicine. Apart from the wide scope of the group 1 and group 2 metals andzinc as efﬁcient initiators, the rapidly emerging application of rare-earth metalcomplexes in the production of PLAs has provided excellent results. Interestingly,well-deﬁned complexes of titanium, zirconium, and hafnium are not too far fromapplication for their ROP activity in producing PLAs in both bulk and solution
polymerization at relatively higher temperatures.
Investigations of the metal–ligand synergies and the role of the coordination
geometry on the ROP of lactide afforded a number of miscellaneous metalinitiators, which proved to be effective in control of the polymerization in bulk athigher temperatures. In most cases, intermediates of polymerization were proposedfrom the evidence of kinetics studies using NMR spectroscopy and solid state X-raystructural characterization of the metal catalyst. These results provide a betterunderstanding for identifying new metal–ligand systems and the architecture of
the ancillary ligands and for optimizing ROP activity and stereocontrol to give
PLAs with desired microstructures.
Apart from the structurally well-deﬁned metal complexes and their ROP
activities, metal salts and metal complexes that are efﬁcient for the glycolideROP are also included. Finally, certain areas of the metal-catalyzed ROP of lactidesand glycolide are yet to be explored; one is the developement of efﬁcient initiatorsthat can exert greater stereocontrol to produce desired isotactic PLA fromrac-lactide. A further developement would be the search for well-deﬁned metal
initiators that can impart control of the average length of the glycolidyl and lactidyl
blocks in the PLGA copolymer. It can be expected that plenty of interesting ligandarchitectures and applications of their metal complexes in ROP will be presented inthe future.

Bionolle (Polybutylenesuccinate)
Yasushi Ichikawa and Tatsuya Mizukoshi
Abstract “Bionolle” was ﬁrst commercially manufactured by Showa Highpolymer
and is now well known as a pioneer of green plastic materials. Bionolle is an aliphaticpolyester and has similar processability as conventional resins like polyethylene.Bionolle is one of the most suitable materials for processing into ﬁlms, which havebeen utilized for agricultural purposes, shopping bags, compost bags, and so on.Showa Highpolymer has succeeded in producing a compound of Bionolle and starch
that is not only similar to homogeneous Bionolle in its principal properties, but is also
an environmentally friendly material. The latest achievements on this issue arereported, along with life cycle analysis (LCA) results.

1 Introduction
According to the deﬁnition by Japan BioPlastic Association (JBPA), there are twotypes of so-called GreenPla. One is biodegradable plastic, which means that theplastic will be completely decomposed into H
2O and CO 2by environmental286 Y. Ichikawa and T. Mizukoshi
microorganisms and extracellular enzymes. The other type is bio-based plastic.
This means that the plastic is made from renewable resources like starch, sugar,cellulose, and so on.
Bionolle is a typical biodegradable plastic. Currently, each raw material is made
from petroleum, but we are developing more environmentally friendly greenplastics. The ﬁrst approach is to produce plastics from monomers such as succinicacid by biological methods. The second approach is to make hybrid compounds ofBionolle and natural resources like starch. The typical chain of materials forBionolle is shown in Fig. 1.
First, polymerization is carried out from petrochemical materials. When
Bionolle is discarded in soil or thrown into compost, it will be decomposed into
oligomers by extracellular enzymes from existing microbes and then will be
absorbed into cell bodies to be decomposed completely into CO
2and H 2O. These
will be absorbed by plants as carbon sources.
From this step, two options are possible. One is to manufacture “bio-based”
monomers and the other is to use renewable biomass to manufacture compoundsthat combine natural products with petro-based Bionolle. This review explains bothcases.
In both cases, a life cycle chain could be achieved to make our Greenpla
products more environmentally friendly.

2 History and Recent Development of Bionolle
In Table 1, the history and recent development of Bionolle are summarized.
Showa Highpolymer Co., Ltd. started research and development of “new biode-
gradable plastics” in 1989. At that time, a lot of waste plastics, ﬁshing lines, ﬁshingnets etc. were being left in the environment and were becoming a big social
problem. So, our R&D was aimed at ﬁnd a solution to such pollution. We started
mass-production of Bionolle, and marketing in 1993. We are undoubtedly one ofthe pioneers of biodegradable plastics.
“O.K. compost” was acquired in 1998. An independent organization approved
the biodegradability and safety of use of Bionolle as compost bags.
The development of bio-based succinic acid production was carried out as
the NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization,an implementing agency of METI in Japan) project from 2004 to 2006, and the
possibility of bio-based materials was conﬁrmed.
The hybrid compound of Bionolle and starch was developed by Showa
Highpolymer in 2006 and has already been launched in the market.
3 Structures of Bionolle
3.1 Chemical Structure of Bionolle
Bionolle is an aliphatic polyester as shown in Fig. 2. We have two grades for
Bionolle: poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and poly(butylene succinate/adipate)(PBSA), the copolymer of 1,4-butandiol and succinic acid/adipic acid. We callPBS the 1000 series, and PBSA the 3000 series. PBSA with higher adipic acidcontent is the 5000 series.
Biodegradability improves with higher content of adipic acid in the copolymer;
however, the melting point decreases and the crystallization is worse.Table 1 History and recent

3.2 Molecular Structure of Bionolle
When we look at the molecular structure of our polymer Bionolle, there are also two
types as shown in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst type of structure is linear, and the other is the long
chain branching (LCB) type. The LCB type is featured by its higher melt tensionand higher crystallization temperature, being designed for better processability. We
control LCB structure by means of branching agents. The detailed structures of
LCB were elucidated by means of gel permeation chromatography–multi-anglelight scattering (GPC-MALLS), as reported by Yoshikawa et al. [ 1]. Bionolle
#1903, which has LCB, was found to contain two LCBs in a single molecule. Inother words, #1903 has an H-shaped structure.
3.3 Molecular Weight Versus Melt Flow Rate for Bionolle
Figure 4shows the relationship between melt ﬂow rate (MFR) measured at 190/C14C
and 2.16 kg load and the weight average molecular weight (Mw). We have manygrades of Bionolle with various ﬂowabilities (MFR ranging from 1 g/10 min to50 g/10 min) to meet a variety of processing methods. The linear types show a
correlation of Mw with MFR as indicated in Fig. 4. The LCB type shows higher Mw
than that of the linear type when we compare Bionelles with the same MFR, and thisphenomenon is due to the LCB. The grade having MFR ¼1, and hence high Mw,
shows better processability and mechanical properties for blown ﬁlm processing.Higher Mw versions will become more crucial in the future to meet the need forhigh strength.H-[O-(CH2)4-O-CO-(CH2)m-CO]N-OH

3.4 Grade Naming of Binolle
Figure 5explains the designation rule of grade naming for Bionolle. The grade
name consists of four digits and additional letters. The ﬁrst digit corresponds to thechemical structure, whereby 1 represents PBS (1000 series), and 3 and 5 representPBSA (3000 and 5000 series, respectively). The difference between 3 and 5 is thecontent of adipic acid; the 5 type contains higher amount of adipic acid in thestructure. The second digit corresponds to the molecular structure. Digits 0 and 9
represent linear and LCB types, respectively. The third and forth digits represent the
MFR range. For instance, 03 means that the MFR is 4.1–7 g/10 min. The last letterindicates the additive formula or the kind of ﬁller etc.
Bionolle has wide variety of chemical structure, molecular structure, molecular
weight, and additive packages to meet a variety of applications and processingmethods. The molecular design of aliphatic polyesters, made through condensation,can vary widely by selecting a variety of monomers. We have a unique technologyfor controlling Mw to obtain high Mw grades. Furthermore, we have polymer alloy
technology to cover a variety of customer requirements. Bionolle itself could be
easily compounded with other well-known biopolymers like PLA, PBTA, and PHAand used to improve their properties. We can control stiffness, biodegradability,elongation ability and so on by changing the blend ratio. Renewable resources likestarch could be also used for Bionolle compounds.

released new grades in which the starch is compounded with mainly Bionolle and
PLA. The brand name of these new grades is “STARCLA.” Based on our polymeralloy technology, we can use more than 60% of plant-derived materials in this
compound.
3.5 Bionolle Crystal Structures and Transition Mechanism
It is well known that there are two types of crystal structure in Bionolle (as shown inFig.6)[2]. The crystal structures are formed mainly by the major component, PBS.
The 1000 series is described here, and the structures of the 3000 and 5000 series arethe same. Figure 6a shows the crystal structure observed from the molecular axis;
Fig. 6 (a) Crystal structures
of Bionolle, along the
molecular axis. ( b) Crystal
structures of Bionolle, alongtheb-axisBionolle (Polybutylenesuccinate) 291
the molecular packing is similar to polyethylene. The alpha form is general and the
beta form can be seen under a certain level of stress.
Figure 6b shows a side view (observed from the b-axis). The conformations are
different from one another. The alpha form consists of G and /C0G, while the beta
form has an all-trans structure. The ﬁber identity lengths are 10.9 A and 11.9 A for
alpha and beta forms, respectively.
Figure 7shows the relation between crystal structure and mechanical properties
of highly crystalline and highly ordered uniaxial oriented ﬁber specimens [ 3,4].
At strain 0–7%, the stress–strain curve is linear and only the alpha form can beobserved. At strain 13–18%, the stress–strain curve shows a plateau regime, and
both alpha and beta forms can be observed. At strains over 22%, the stress–strain
curve increases again, and only the beta form can be observed. This behavior isreproducible under repeated application and removal of stress. Such phenomenonwas also reported in poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT). These characteristics inPBT result in a superior fatigue performance. We can thus also expect good fatigueperformance in Bionolle.
3.6 Crystallization Temperature
Figure 8shows some examples of the improvement in processability using polymer
alloy technology. Bionolle #3001 is mainly used for compostable bags and isfeatured by its softness and rapid biodegradability. However, the processability is
Fig. 7 Relation between crystal structure and mechanical properties292 Y. Ichikawa and T. Mizukoshi
not so good because of its lower crystallization temperature and slower crystalliza-
tion speed. To solve these problems, we can generally use nucleating agents.However, no suitable nucleating agent was available for Bionolle. Therefore, wechose polymer alloy technology to overcome those problems. Figure 8 shows thecrystallization temperature ( T
c) of Bionolle measured by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC). The Tcof the 3000 series is around 50/C14C, that of the 1000
series is 80/C14C, and that of #1903 (LCB type) is 87/C14C. Note that the introduction of
LCB results in a higher Tc. The addition of 15 wt% of #1903 into #3000 results in a
Tcof around 73/C14C, which is 23/C14C higher than the original #3000. In other words, the
addition of #1903 into #3001 increases Tceffectively. In the case of blown ﬁlm
processing, the addition of #1903 also improves the bubble stability. It should benoted that the combination of existing grades of Bionolle allows control of process-ability, mechanical properties, and biodegradability.
3.7 Processability and Physical/Mechanical Properties
We believe that the features of Bionolle are good processability, physical andmechanical properties, and biodegradability. Furthermore, we can control themby monomer selection, polymer alloy technology, and formulation technology of
ﬁllers and additives.
For example, the selection of molecular structure, such as long chain branching
and molecular weight, can result in the improvement of processability. Combina-tion of several grades can be effective at controlling mechanical properties andbiodegradability as well as processability. In addition, optimization of the additiveformula can control the mechanical properties and processability. Recently, we*13003G Tc=50.9 ºC

succeeded in processing thin ﬁlms using our compounding technology. The thick-
ness of normal mulching ﬁlm in Japan is about 20 mm, and that of shopping bags is
more. We have processed 10 mm thickness ﬁlm for agricultural use. This ﬁlm has
enough strengthen to be used as a mulching ﬁlm, and practical testing is currently
ongoing in some test farms.
The promising market segments of Bionolle in the future are compostable bags
and agricultural mulching ﬁlm applications, where better processability (equivalentto conventional resin) and further cost reduction are required.
4 Biodegradation
Figure 9explains the mechanism of so-called biodegradation. Firstly, decomposi-
tion occurs on the surface of Bionolle, and oligomers are generated by the action ofextracellular enzymes, which are thought to be lipases and/or PHB depolymerases.Then, those oligomers are taken into microbes as carbon sources and are meta-bolized completely to generate water and carbon dioxide. Thus, full decomposition
is carried out. In our early study, this degradation was shown to be carried out in
various natural environments, which are generally aerobic. The microbes are quitegeneral and ubiquitous including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria,molds, and actinomyceses [ 5].
Figure 10shows the biodegradation of Bionolle according to the standard test
ISO 14855. All grades of Bionolle satisfy the criteria of biodegradation.
Biodegradability is affected by crystallinity as well as chemical structure. Figure 11
shows an example of biodegradability depending on crystallinity of PBS. Crystallinity
was controlled by annealing temperature and time for hot-pressed sample sheets.
Measurements of crystallinity were performed by means of solid state NMR [ 6,7].
Under anaerobic conditions, Bionolle only shows very slow degradation. There-
fore, it is not suitable to use this type of biodegradable resin to generate methaneand/or hydrogen under anaerobic conditions.

5 Environmental Safety
5.1 Environmental Safety of Decomposed Intermediates
from Bionolle
It is very important to see how decomposed products affect the atmosphere when
Bionolle is used in the environment. First, we tried to determine the decompositionproducts in the soil. After degradation of Bionolle in the soil, an extracted fractionwas analyzed. But, we could not detect any organic fragments from the soil extract.It seemed that all low molecular weight fragments were absorbed into the soil andcould not be easily extracted.020406080100

Next, we tried model degradation by using esterase from microbes. As shown in
Fig. 12, the major products under this condition were butylmonosuccinate and
butyldisuccinate. This shows that the degradation in early stage is carried out by
extracellular enzymes like esterase.
Then, we compared biodegradability and residual degradation products using the
OECD301C method. As shown in Fig. 13, residual degradation products almost
disappeared when biodegradation reached around 80%. This means that Bionolle is

not only converted to CO 2by degradation but also took in cell bodies as carbon
sources.
The question then is what kinds of inﬂuence on the environment are anticipated
by such degradation?
5.2 Inﬂuence on Crops
It is easily anticipated that degradation products will be absorbed by plants and
animals in the environment as well as by microbes. Plant growth tests wereconducted by the Japan Fertilizer and Feed Inspection Association, assuming that
Bionolle is decomposed at the farm. Brassica campestris var.peruviridis was used
as an object. Powder Bionolle was mixed with soil, and then the seeds were sown onthe soil when Bionelle biodegradation reached 30%. We did not see any differencesin the shoot, growth, and numbers and weights of leaves as compared with thecontrol. Furthermore, we have already found that LD
50≧2,000 mg/kg for oral
acute toxicity in rat. We conclude that Bionelle has little inﬂuence on plants andanimals in the environment.
5.3 Residues of Bionolle and Their Inﬂuence on the Soil
Environment
Agricultural mulching ﬁlm is one of the typical applications for biodegradable
plastics. Currently, Bionolle mulching ﬁlm is commonly used in Japan, and isan important market for us. However, some farmers are anxious about the effectsof repeated use of biodegradable plastic on the farm. We, as a manufacturer ofBionolle, need to accumulate knowledge on such usage in the farm.
We investigated this issue utilizing the method for chemical fertilizer analysis.
In this method, Bionolle is supposed to be used once every year. The residualamount of Bionolle after single usage is expressed as aand the residual percentage
after one year is expressed as r. Then, the residual amount of Bionolle after using
ntimes, R(n), is expressed by the equation below:
RðnÞ¼a/C21/C0r
nðÞ =1/C0rðÞ r<1ðÞ
Bionolle is thought to decompose 50% after 1.5 months, so rwill be 0.004.
When napproaches inﬁnity, then R(n) is approximated as a.This means that
repeated use of Bionolle will never result in accumulation of resin in the soilenvironment.
We also looked at the effect of Bionelle on the population of microbes in the soil.
We time-dependently monitored the population of microbes in soil in whichBionolle (Polybutylenesuccinate) 297
Bionolle was decomposed. Glucose medium and Bionolle medium were used
to chase populations of both of glucose-assimilating microbes and Bionolle-assimilating microbes. Populations of both types of microbes constantly increasewhile Bionolle is used in the soil. However, Bionolle-assimilating microbes
decreased dramatically soon after stopping the use of Bionelle in the soil. This
clearly shows that the soil environment becomes acclimatized to decomposeBionolle (Fig. 14).
5.4 Environmental Safety of Bionolle
In this chapter, we have described the inﬂuence of Bionolle and its degradation
products on the environment. Binolle is proven to be fully decomposed to CO 2,
water, and biomass by microbes in the environment. The decomposed products donot have any unfavorable inﬂuence on the environment.
6 Bio-based Succinic Acid
The manufacturing path of major monomers, succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol isshown in Fig. 15. Both monomers are manufactured from petroleum at the moment.

Succinic acid is commonly produced in microbes because it exists as a part of the
TCA cycle, one of the ordinary metabolic pathways for production of energy. Severalgroups in the world are developing this production system to produce cheapersuccinic acid from renewable resources like starch, glucose, cellulose and so on. If
succinic acid could be produced from cheap carbon sources and the price were
competitive with the petroleum-base product, many C4 chemicals could be expectedas derivatives. 1,4-Butanediol is the typical one, which has a huge market.
There are several companies and groups that are developing bio-based succinic
acid production for commercial use. The Showa group possesses a unique technol-ogy for puriﬁcation of succinic acid from fermentation broth. This is the fractionalcrystallization method starting from sodium succinate. The yield by this method isaround 70%, but we can recycle the residual solution so that we can minimize the
loss of the product. We also compared the cost-effectiveness of this method with
the bipolar electrodialysis method. The cost of our puriﬁcation process seemed tobe about half (our internal data).
The Showa group has already tested bio-based succinic acid, which was puriﬁed
by our pilot facility, in the polymerization for Bionolle #3001. In many cases, bio-based succinic acid contains some impurities that inhibit polymerization, and causedark coloring after polymerization. Our product did not cause such problems andturned out to have good purity and speciﬁcations as a monomer. Furthermore, we
compared ﬁlm processability and the physical properties of resins from both bio-
based and petro-based Bionolle. The speciﬁcations and the conditions of a ﬁlmfabrication machine are shown in Table 2. Figure 16shows the processing. As for
the processability, it was good enough in comparison with the petro-based Bionolle.Table 3shows the comparison of physical properties of both ﬁlms. There is no
signiﬁcant difference between the two ﬁlms. Therefore, we could conﬁrm the highquality of bio-based succinic acid to be used as a monomer for Bionolle.Production from BiomassProduction by Petrochemical Method

7 Starch–Bionolle Compounds
When we think of more environmentally friendly materials, the compound of starch
and Bionolle is thought to be promising. But, on the other hand, the physicalproperties tend to become worse after compounding. We had to overcome thesecontradictions to commercialize our starch compound.
After a long development time, we started manufacture of the compound
by carrying out a mull extrusion. The conditions for mull extrusion are especiallyimportant to produce good quality compound. The ﬁlm processing is only possiblewhen the selection of extrusion conditions is appropriate. The properties of the
manufactured ﬁlm are also affected by these conditions. The conditions of blown
ﬁlm processing for this starch compound are shown in Table 4.
7.1 Agricultural Mulching Film
Figure 17is a photo showing setting the starch compound mulching ﬁlm at our pilot
farm. Mechanical strengthen of the ﬁlm was good enough in comparison with the
conventional mulching ﬁlm, and there was no trouble in using the ordinary settingmachine. The physical properties of both starch compound ﬁlm and normalBionolle ﬁlm are shown in Table 5. The tear resistance for the machine direction
is remarkably low for intact Bionolle ﬁlm, which is the only defect for this resin. Onthe other hand, this defect is dramatically improved for the starch compound ﬁlm.As a result, physical properties of this ﬁlm are sufﬁcient for use as mulching ﬁlm.

compound. The big difference in manufacture of these bags to processing
of mulching ﬁlm is the requirement for heat sealing. The heat seal strength isthe major issue of the starch compound for practical uses. The relationship of theheat-sealing strength to heat-sealing temperature is shown in Fig. 19. Generally
speaking, 1.0 kg/15 mm width is considered to be the threshold for using the bagspractically. So, the performance of Bionolle #5151 is strong enough for this pur-
pose. However, the performance of the starch compound is around the threshold,
so some improvements are required.
8 Life Cycle Analysis
Evaluation of life cycle analysis (LCA) is thought to be important to conﬁrmwhether a process is really environmentally friendly or not. When the carbon source
of some products comes from renewable resources, it is called “carbon neutral” and
it is often thought that this means that a product is good for environment. But, asshown in Fig. 20, a lot of CO
2must be generated in every process and we have to
accumulate all of that generated CO 2to evaluate the efﬁciency of the production
process.1

Bionolle for ﬁlm application is expected to be an alternative for LDPE, and
Bionolle for foaming is expected to be an alternative for polystyrene.
8.2 Functional Unit
We evaluated resin pellets used to form each product in this study. We focused onpellets alone since the process of forming products from pellets, including agricul-tural mulching ﬁlms and seedling cultivation pots, compost bags, packagingmaterials, sandbags, and foamed plastic blocks for shock absorbers, are more orless identical. This time, evaluation was conducted for petro-based Bionolle pellets
(1 kg) and starch–Bionolle compound pellets (1 kg). Both types of pellets have
virtually the same function at the same quantities and both pellet types are used onlyonce without recycling.
8.3 System Boundaries
8.3.1 System Boundaries
We examined all processes (from raw material extraction, production, and
shipping) for succinic acid, 1,4-butanediol, and starch purchased as intermediate
materials and examined Bionolle production plant, product distribution, and dis-
posal after use for each of the two Bionolle types used in this study: naphtha-derived neat Bionolle and starch–Bionolle compound. For disposal after use, onlycarbon emissions from Bionolle after biodegradation were taken into account.Disposal treatment was disregarded because the materials can be placed in landﬁllswithout treatment. Carbon from starch was disregarded, since we ignore CO

8.3.2 Omitted Processes
Transportation processes upstream of succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol are dis-
regarded, except for sea transport of crude oil. Treatment of wastewater generatedin the plant and preparation of catalysts used in production are deemed negligiblefactors and omitted from this evaluation. Based on data provided from the plant ofShowa Denko, auxiliary materials used in production other than succinic acid and1,4-butanediol account for a mere 0.2% of raw materials by total weight. They areomitted from this evaluation. Additionally, we do not evaluate ﬁlm processing in
this study, since the process is nearly identical for all products.
8.4 Data Classiﬁcation (Calculated Environmental Load)
Since synthetic resins are generally formed from crude oil, consumption of fossilfuels and the accompanying contribution to global warming represent the most
crucial issues. Global warming has become a crucial international environmentalissue, and the Kyoto Protocol, which went into effect in February 2005, setreduction targets for greenhouse gas emission for Japan as a nation (6% reductionin emission on average for 2008–2012 from a 1990 baseline). In this study, weinvestigate global warming and examine CO
2emission, which contributes most to
global warming as an environmental load factor.Naphtha

8.5 Speciﬁc Unit Values Used
CO 2emission can be classiﬁed as originating from fossil fuel combustion, chemical
reactions, or mining of natural gas and crude oil. We refer to basic data from LCAsoftware JEMAI LCA Ver. 1.1.6 [ 8] in this study. Gaps are remedied by preparing
data on fossil fuel consumption and electric power consumption for each process,based on the literature and other sources. Values for CO
2emission upstream of
basic data on the software JEMAI LCA Ver. 1.1.6 are used as is. On the other hand,for processes for which process-speciﬁc calculations are carried out, we adopt
speciﬁc unit emission for CO
2accompanying fossil fuel consumption (fossil fuel
production and fossil fuel combustion) and electric power consumption (productionof fuel for power generation and power generation) from the JEMAI LCA Ver.1.1.6 data. For a CO
2emission factor of electric power generated at petrochemical
plants, we adopt data from the literature [ 9].
8.6 Life Cycle Inventory Analysis
8.6.1 Bionolle Based on Naphtha-Derived Succinic Acid
Succinic Acid ProductionFor succinic acid production, we estimate the energy consumption of the production
process; amounts of raw materials such as naphtha, heavy oil and water; and
amounts of hydrogen and oxygen required in the intermediate processes, basedon number of sources [ 8,10,11]. For production of the raw materials naphtha and
heavy oil, and for hydrogen and oxygen required, we adopt data from JEMAI LCAVer. 1.1.6 [ 8]. For water used in the process, we adopt the data on clean water
supply from the literature [ 12].
1,4-Butanediol Production
For the 1,4-butanediol production process, we estimate energy consumption during
production, amounts of raw materials, naphtha and heavy oil, hydrogen, and oxygenin the same manner as for succinic acid, referring to the literature [ 10]. For
production of raw materials, naphtha and heavy oil, and production of hydrogenand oxygen required, we use data from JEMAI LCA Ver. 1.1.6 [ 8].
Transportation of Raw Materials for Bionolle
Succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol are transported to Tatsuno Factory of Showa
Denko from domestic production plants. In this study, we derive various scenarios306 Y. Ichikawa and T. Mizukoshi
based on actual transportation conditions, including distance, route, means of
transport, and loading ratios. Fuel consumption and CO 2emission for transportation
are estimated based on these scenarios. We use data from JEMAI LCA Ver. 1.1.6
[8] for inventory data per unit amount of transport during transportation.
Bionolle Production
For production of Bionolle from succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol, the yield of
Bionolle and the amounts of succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol used are calculated
based on actual performance data of the plant of Showa Denko where Bionolle is
actually produced. Consumption of steam, heavy oil, and electric power in the plantare also calculated based on the actual performance data.
Bionolle Distribution
Although we considered omitting the Bionolle distribution process itself, since
there is no difference between the products at this stage, we assume transportationover a distance of 100 km by 10 ton trucks at 100% loading ratios to verify theeffects of this stage on the total life cycle. Data from JEMAI LCA Ver. 1.1.6 [ 8]i s
used as data per unit amount of transport during transportation.
Bionolle Utilization
For Bionolle utilization, we set the discharge of environmental load to 0, since this
process does not involve consumption of energy, water, or other materials.
Bionolle Disposal
Since Bionolle is biodegradable, it should spontaneously decompose and revert to
soil when left in soil. Given these characteristics, we assume complete biodegrada-tion in soil rather than recovery and disposal.
Emission of carbon contained in Bionolle drawn from fossil resources must
be accounted for as CO
2. However, there has been no study mentioning the ratio
of carbon components discharged into the open air after biodegradation in soil.Instead, it is assumed that the entire component will be emitted into the open air
as CO

8.6.2 Starch–Bionolle Compound
Starch–Bionolle compound is produced by kneading Bionolle as shown in
Sect. 8.6.1 with certain amounts of starch and a plasticizer. All the production
processes, except for the production processes for starch and plasticizer newly
added as raw materials and those for starch and plasticizer for kneading neat
Bionolle, are the same as in Sect. 8.6.1. Product distributions are also the same as
in Sect. 8.6.1 , since weight and distribution conditions are identical. However, CO 2
emission to be accounted for in the disposal process is different from that in
Sect. 8.6.1 , since raw materials include biomass, i.e., starch. Transportation pro-
cesses of starch and plasticizer to the Tatsuno Factory are also different. The datafor newly added processes and for processes different from those in Sect. 8.6.1 are
shown below.
Starch Production
For starch production, we refer to published inventory data [ 13] prepared based
on 1995 Input–Output Tables. The economic value of starch is based on 1995
Input–Output Tables [ 14].
Plasticizer (Glycerin) Production
For plasticizer production, we refer to publicized inventory data [ 13] prepared
based on 1995 Input–Output Tables. Economic value of plasticizer is based on1995 Input–Output Tables [ 14].
Transportation of Raw Materials for the Starch–Bionolle Compound
Transportation of succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol and other various raw materials
is the same as for Bionolle. Starch and plasticizer are transported to Showa DenkoTatsuno Factory from domestic and overseas production plants. We derive variousscenarios from actual transport information in this study, including distance, route,means of transport, and loading ratios. Fuel consumption and CO
2emission related
to transportation are estimated based on these scenarios. As starch is assumed to be
produced in the USA, we account for both sea transportation from the USA to Japan
and land transportation from domestic ports to the Tatsuno Factory in this study.For inventory data per unit amount of transport during transportation, we refer todata from JEMAI LCA Ver. 1.1.6 [ 8] for land transportation and data from the
literature [ 15] for sea transportation; in particular, data from the literature [ 16]i s
also referred to for sea transportation distances.308 Y. Ichikawa and T. Mizukoshi
Starch Kneading
For starch–Bionolle compound production process, we obtain data of product
yield and mixing ratios of Bionolle, starch, plasticizer, and water from actual site
data provided by Showa Denko. Data of electric power consumption for kneadingprocess are taken from actual site data from Showa Denko.
Bionolle Disposal
The amount of CO
2derived from petroleum is estimated from the rate of CO 2
emission from Bionolle by multiplying with the content ratio of Bionolle in the
product. CO 2generated by starch is omitted from CO 2emission on complete
degradation in soil, since these emissions are biomass-generated.
8.7 Results of Life Cycle Inventory Analyses
Figure 22shows the results of life cycle CO 2emission analyses of Bionolle and
starch–Bionolle compound. For starch–Bionolle compound, the life cycle CO 2
emission is around 30% less than for Bionolle, i.e., around 20% less for productionalone.

For both Bionolle and starch–Bionolle compound, the largest amount of CO 2is
emitted from disposal, i.e., around 60% of total amount for Bionolle and around50% of total amount for starch–Bionolle compound.
During production, Bionolle production from succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol
account for 30% (around two-thirds, disregarding disposal) of the total Bionolle lifecycle. Overall production of succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol, which involveexothermal reactions, account for about 10% (about 25%, excluding disposal) ofthe total life cycle.
For starch–Bionolle compound, Bionolle production from succinic acid and
1,4-butanediol corresponded to approximately one-quarter (one-half excludingdisposal) of the total life cycle. Production of succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol
account for about 10% (around 20%, excluding disposal) of the total life cycle. In
addition, the starch kneading process accounts for about 5% of the total life cycle.Sea transport for starch account for around 3% of the total life cycle.
8.8 Interpretation
8.8.1 Comparison of Performance to Other Products
We compare data on Bionolle, and conventional resins (LDPE and polystyrene).
Bionolle is regarded as a potential substitute for LDPE in ﬁlm processing and other
molded products and as a substitute for polystyrene in foaming. We compare 1 kg
of each resin.
8.8.2 Comparative Evaluation of LCA Results
Figure 23shows the result of comparisons of life cycle CO 2emission of Bionolle,
starch–Bionolle compound, LDPE, and polystyrene. Data for producing LDPE andpolystyrene are taken from a report of the Plastic Waste Management Institute [ 17].
The disposal method assumed is incineration. CO
2emissions from both Bionolle
and starch–Bionolle compound are lower than those of LDPE or polystyrene.
8.9 Conclusion
In addition to high biodegradability, Bionolle is veriﬁed by this study to offer CO 2
emission characteristics superior to conventional resins, despite the fact that rawmaterials (succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol) are derived from naphtha. Given theprospects for producing succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol from biomass and wastepaper, Bionolle may eventually offer even greater environmental beneﬁts when it310 Y. Ichikawa and T. Mizukoshi
no longer involves use of oil resources. Future quantitative evaluations of these
aspects are needed.
Bionolle was shown to be environmentally superior to conventional resins.
However, in addition to Bionolle, various biodegradable resins such as polylacticacid are known to have different resin characteristics. Objective evaluations of suchbiodegradable resins will become increasingly important in comparing environ-
mental loads imposed by various life cycles, although issues other than LCA results
may ultimately play roles in selection of resin. We anticipate a growing demand forstudies comparing biodegradable resins and resins derived from biomass resourcesin regard to applications or economic efﬁciency under identical conditions.
9 Summary
9.1 Bio-based Succinic Acid
Polymerization of Bionolle #3001 (polybutylene succinate/adipate) using bio-based
and petro-based succinic acid was examined. As for polymerization conditions andprocessability, there was no signiﬁcant difference between these two types of resin.Mechanical properties of blown ﬁlms processed from both resins were almost thesame. The quality of bio-based succinic acid turned out to be good enough as apolymer grade.0123456

9.2 Starch–Bionolle Compound
Agricultural mulching ﬁlm of starch–Bionolle compound has been tested at a
pilot farm. Film processability and mechanical properties are relatively goodand tear resistance, which is the typical defect of Bionolle, has been especiallyimproved. Compost bags of starch–Bionolle compound have two problems. One iswater resistance and the other is heat seal strength. We are developing a newstarch–Bionolle compound grade for compost bags to improve these problems.
9.3 Life Cycle Analysis
LCA is an important process for evaluating the effects that a product has on theenvironment over the entire period of its life. We evaluated LCA by comparing
total CO
2(life cycle CO 2) exhaust from production of Bionolle and of conventional
resins like LDPE. From this analysis, Bionolle has turned out to be more a environ-mentally friendly resin than LDPE. The effectiveness of the starch–Bionolle com-pound has also been conﬁrmed.

1 Introduction
Polyurethanes are highly versatile polymers that are used in a wide range of appli-
cations common to everyday life. The latitude of control over key design features,
including features at the microscale (crosslink density and hard segment content),mesoscale (phase morphology), and macroscale (foam density and cell dimen-sions), enables polyurethanes to fulﬁll performance requirements for a wide rangeof products such as low temperature elastomers, high tensile adhesives, ﬂexible,open-celled foams for bedding and furniture, and rigid, closed-cell foams forinsulation.
Factors such as the price and availability of petroleum, and societal concerns
over global climate change continue to create increased market pressure on the
industrial and domestic use of petrochemicals. Many industrial suppliers of basicchemicals are looking to alternative, sustainable sources of raw materials. In thepolyurethanes industry, suppliers of polyols have been utilizing naturally sourcedraw materials for many years in conjunction with petrochemical raw materials.Recently, the polyurethanes industry has moved toward greater replacement ofpetrochemical content with renewable resources. The principle sources of renew-able feedstock are the triglyceride oils found in seeds such as soybean, canola, and
sunﬂower. New, non-food sources of triglycerides such as Lesquerella and
Vernonia , and even aquatic sources such as algae, are beginning to draw attention,
even as old sources such as castor oil are getting a new look.
2 Basics of Polyurethane Chemistry
2.1 Polyols and Isocyanates
Polyurethanes are composed of the reaction products of polyisocyanates and
polyalcohols. The chemistry of polyurethanes has been under development for over316 D.A. Babb
60 years, and the product chemistry is highly reﬁned toward optimum performance in
end-user applications. In order to guide the reader in understanding the challengesthat are faced when introducing a completely new base of raw materials into
polyurethane products, a focused introduction to polyurethane chemistry is in order.
Isocyanate chemistry is of itself a very complex ﬁeld of chemistry, and even a
brief description of the extent is outside the scope of this article. For a comprehen-sive description of isocyanate chemistry and its applications to polyurethanepolymers, readers are directed to a handbook that is the standard in the industry[1]. A brief description follows for the purpose of introducing the role of isocyanates
in polyurethane chemistry.
The two key isocyanates that are used in the greatest volumes for polyurethane
polymers are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate
(MDI). Both isocyanates are produced ﬁrst by nitration of aromatics (toluene andbenzene, respectively), followed by hydrogenation of the nitro aromatics to providearomatic amines. In the case of MDI, the aniline intermediate is then condensedwith formaldehyde to produce methylene dianiline (MDA), which is a mixture ofmonomeric MDA and an oligomeric form that is typical of aniline/formaldehydecondensation products [ 2]. The subsequent reaction of phosgene with the aromatic
amines provides the isocyanate products. Isocyanates can also be prepared by the
reaction of aromatic amines with dimethylcarbonate [ 3,4]. This technology has
been tested at the industrial pilot scale, but is not believed to be practiced commer-cially at this time.
These two isocyanates are used individually in the monomeric form, or in blends
(e.g., TM20, a TDI/MDI blend for automotive ﬂexible foams), and are often pre-advanced into oligomeric forms with very low molecular weight diols to formisocyanate-capped prepolymers.
Isocyanates can also be advanced into a variety of intermediate products that
contain different forms of condensation oligomers. These advanced products are
typically used in applications where the reactivity or the viscosity of the isocyanateis modiﬁed for speciﬁc requirements in an end-use application.
Isocyanates that are produced from aliphatic amines are utilized in a limited
range of polyurethane products, mainly in weatherable coatings and specialtyapplications where the yellowing and photodegradation of the aromatic polyure-thanes are undesirable [ 5]. The aliphatic isocyanates are not used more widely in
the industry due to the remarkably slow reaction kinetics of aliphatic isocyanates
compared to their aromatic counterparts [ 6]. Due to the slow reactivity of aliphatic
isocyanates, it is not practical to use them in the preparation of ﬂexible or rigidfoams, which are the main commercial applications for polyurethane chemistry.
Due to the necessity for aromatic structure in the commodity isocyanates, and
the intensive chemical conversions required to derive the isocyanate reactant, nohigh-carbon frameworks derived principally from plant sources have been devel-oped into isocyanates. The majority of the derivation of raw materials from highcarbon conjugates has been focused on the development of polyols, for which the
structural demands are a better ﬁt for available renewable feedstocks. Although
there are some notable exceptions [ 1], as a general rule modiﬁcation of thePolyurethanes from Renewable Resources 317
properties of polyurethanes are most commonly accomplished through structural
modiﬁcation of the polyol components.
Polyurethane chemistry began with the utilization of polyester polyols, princi-
pally prepared from diacids such as adipic acid and various diols. Later, polyester
polyols were replaced by polyether polyols due to improvements in mechanicalproperties and moisture resistance. Polyether polyols now constitute the greater partof the volume in polyurethane polymers [ 1].
2.2 Conventional Polyether Polyols
Conventional polyether polyols are principally derived from polymers of propylene
oxide (PO), optionally containing some ethylene oxide (EO). Usually, thecopolymers contain a maximum of approximately 20% EO. The oxiranes EO and
PO are derived from petroleum feedstocks. The process begins with the cracking of
crude oil in a thermal catalytic cracker, which produces a mixture of ethylene andpropylene, depending on the process conﬁguration [ 7,8]. The ethylene is then
converted to EO in a direct oxidation process using air over a silver catalyst [ 9]. The
analogous direct oxidation of propylene to PO has been the subject of substantialresearch, but no practical commercial process has been developed to date. Conven-tional technology converts propylene to propylene chlorohydrin via treatmentwith HOCl, followed by elimination of HCl to provide PO [ 10,11]. More current
technology can co-produce PO with styrene monomer, or more preferably, can
produce PO via oxidation of propylene with hydrogen peroxide [ 12].
Polymerization of the oxiranes is typically propagated from a starter molecule
that is chosen to deﬁne the functionality ( f) of the ﬁnal polyol. The functionality
and the molecular weight of polyols are the main design features that deﬁne thepolyurethane properties in the end-use applications. Additionally, the balance ofEO and PO in the polyether polyols, mainly for ﬂexible foam polyols, is tailoredto enhance the compatibility of formulations and the processability of the foam
products. The exact composition of the polyols deﬁnes the crucial performance
features of the ﬁnal polyurethane product. Even seemingly small differences inpolyol composition can result in changes to polyol processability and polyurethaneperformance. This becomes a crucial issue when replacing conventional petro-chemical polyols with polyols from different feedstocks. To demonstrate thesensitivity of commercial formulations to changes in feedstocks, a simple exampleis offered below.
Conventional polyether polyol technology involves alkoxylation of the starters
with PO and EO using an alkali metal hydroxide catalyst such as potassium
hydroxide. The catalyst can be neutralized and the neutral salt can be left in theﬁnal polyol, or optionally the catalyst can be extracted by washing with water or bydeposition on an ion exchange medium. In recent years, a new catalyst technologyhas become widely adopted within the polyols industry, using zinc hexacyano-cobaltate (double metal cyanide catalyst, or DMC), which runs at very high318 D.A. Babb
efﬁciency and does not currently require removal from the ﬁnal polyol products
[13–15]. Conventional KOH-produced polyols and DMC-produced polyols are not
identical in composition, morphology or in reactivity, even when produced from thesame combination of raw materials. Subtle differences such as the primary OHcontent, which is created by a slightly higher tail-to-tail addition defect when usingthe DMC catalyst, and major differences such as the average functionality of the
ﬁnal product create processing issues for the manufacturers of polyurethane
products. When carefully designed, the polyols are similar enough that mostpolyurethane producers can make process adjustments to interchange productswhen similar KOH and DMC polyols are used. The production of polyols frompetroleum feedstocks is outlined in Fig. 1.
Most polyurethane elastomers are prepared from high molecular weight
(2,000–12,000) diols due to the high elongation required by many elastomerapplications. Flexible foam formulations are comprised of polyols with lower mole-
cular weight (3,000–5,000) and with a few exceptions are usually initiated from
glycerin ( f¼3). Rigid insulation foams are prepared from low molecular weight
polyols (400–1,000) with high functionality ( f¼3–8). Rigid foam polyols in
particular are often produced from blends of initiators such as glycerin, sucrose,sorbitol, or other natural carbohydrates to produce a polyol with a speciﬁed averagefunctionality. The key design variables for polyether polyols are outlined in Fig. 2.
2.3 Making Polyurethane Polymers
As noted previously, polyurethanes are prepared by combining polyols and
polyisocyanates. In reality, the term “polyurethane” is a misnomer because the

urethane linkage in the polymer is a minor part of the polymer functionality. In
many polyurethane formulations for foams, the reaction of isocyanate with water isthe predominant chemical reaction, producing CO
2as a “blowing” agent (water-
blown foams) and re-generating the aniline precursor functionality. The aniline
then reacts very quickly with another isocyanate to generate a urea functionalgroup, creating the aromatic “hard segment” of the polyurethane and providingchain propagation through step-growth addition. The competing chemistries thatproduce polyurethane/polyurea polymers are outlined in Fig. 3.

the free energy of randomization, and the hard segment components begin to
organize into discreet domains. The precipitation of this second phase domain isexpected to follow the classic surface area minimization thermodynamics observed
in other amphiphilic polymer systems [ 16,17]. If sufﬁcient volume fraction of hard
segment domain exists, the hard segment can attain a co-continuous morphology,which provides structural integrity to the growing polymer system, often wellbefore the gel-point of the polymer matrix is reached. Such is the case in ﬂexiblefoam systems where the actual covalent crosslink density is very low. The end-useapplications for polyurethane ﬂexible foams constitute the largest volume segmentof the polyurethanes industry, and include bedding, furniture, automotive interiors,and other applications associated with human comfort.
There are a few key features of polyurethane components that maximize the
opportunity for polyurethanes to achieve the mesoscale morphology that results inthe desirable properties of these polymers. Uniformity of component raw materialsis an important variable. Disruption of polyol hydroxy equivalent weight (HEW ¼
MW/ f) distribution outside the normal Poisson distribution achieved by conven-
tional catalysis [ 18,19] causes an accumulation of phase organizational defects,
which increases as the breadth of polyol HEW increases. This disruption of phaseorganization (phase mixing) has a signiﬁcant effect on the mechanical properties of
the ﬁnal ﬂexible polymer products, the principle one being the elasticity or resil-
iency of the resulting ﬂexible polymer. Polymer modulus is increased, and tensileand tear strength can be adversely affected. In some polyurethane ﬂexible products,it is desirable to enhance phase mixing and this can be achieved by controllinghard segment content and by mixing polyether polyols of different HEWs [ 20].
Such products are prepared for viscoelastic bedding and furniture, and for sounddampening in some automotive interiors. In most conventional ﬂexible foam appli-cations, however, it is desirable to maximize phase segregation in order to achieve
the best properties of the ﬂexible products.
In high tensile and high elongation elastomers, it is also desirable to achieve a
very high polymer molecular weight with high uniformity and little branching orcrosslinking. The best performing elastomers are prepared from high molecularweight diol precursors with low polydispersity and low monol content, such as thepolytetramethylene glycol (PTMG) polyols, prepared by cationic polymerization ofTHF [ 21]. Polyurethane/polyurea polymers prepared from these polyols are used in
the preparation of Spandex ﬁbers. The combination of high uniformity and low
glass transition temperature ( T
g) contribute to the ultrahigh performance of these
elastomers.
3 Renewable Feedstocks in Polyols for Polyurethanes
The use of naturally derived complex carbon compounds as raw materials forpolyurethane polymers is not new to the industry. Since the advent of polyetherpolyols, polyurethane polymers have utilized natural sources of renewable carbon.Polyurethanes from Renewable Resources 321
Glycerin, which is commonly used as the initiator for polyether triols, can be
produced from petrochemical propylene [ 22,23], but is most often derived from
the triglycerides of animal fats or vegetable oils [ 24]. A recent increase in the global
availability of glycerin as a feedstock has been driven by the development of
biodiesel fuels, from which glycerin is a by-product of sizable volume. The
resulting glycerin polyether triols are commonly used to produce ﬂexible foamproducts such as mattresses, pillows, and cushions for bedding and furniture, orfor automotive seating. Polyols with higher functionality are initiated from carbo-hydrates such as sucrose or sorbitol. These types of polyols are used in both ﬂexiblefoams (high molecular weight polyols) and rigid foams for thermal insulation (lowmolecular weight polyols). Because of the low HEW values in rigid foam polyols,the renewable content of these components is often quite high, even when utilizing
conventional petrochemical chain extenders. Figure 4illustrates some of the most
commonly used natural carbohydrates for initiators.
3.1 Seed Oil Triglycerides
Seed oil triglycerides are not new to the ﬁeld of polyurethane polymers. Themost common naturally hydroxylated seed oil, castor oil, has been used directlyin the preparation of polyurethanes for many years. The formulations that contain
castor oil beneﬁt from improved weatherability, moisture resistance, and the
low cost of castor oil, but the beneﬁts are generally offset by some compromisesin performance.
In recent years, industrial research has created new opportunities for the use of
new types of plant-derived oils in polyurethane applications [ 25]. In addition to the

these triglyceride oils have been chemically modiﬁed to produce a variety of
polyols that are suitable for the preparation of polyurethane products.
Seed oil triglycerides consist of three fatty acids esteriﬁed to glycerin. Although
most plants produce at least some C 16fatty acids, the majority of the triglycerides
are comprised of C 18fatty acids. The balance of the fatty acids is quite speciﬁc to
the plant from which the oil is derived, but the most prominent fatty acids amongall plant species consist of a series of 18-carbon fatty acids containing zero, one,two, or three sites of unsaturation. These fatty acids are stearic, oleic, linoleic, andlinolenic acids, respectively. These are the main fatty acids found in most seed oilsand are illustrated in Fig. 5.
Oil-producing plants vary signiﬁcantly in the exact composition of the fatty
acids that make up the triglyceride. Triglyceride fatty acids contain from zero to
as many as four oleﬁns. Table 1illustrates the fatty acid composition of several

common plant oils. The common nomenclature for the industry is utilized, where
the number of carbons of the fatty acid is followed by the number of sites ofunsaturation, e.g., C18:1 is the designation of oleic acid.
The oleﬁns in the fatty acids serve several purposes. Unsaturation in a C
18chain
depresses the freezing point of the fatty acids. The oleﬁns are all in the cisorien-
tation, which creates more disorder in the carbon chain and reduces the freezingpoint further. The fully saturated C
18fatty acid (stearic acid) has a melting point of
69–70/C14C, and the resulting triglycerides are solid at room temperature (e.g.,
hydrogenated vegetable oils). The monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) has amelting point of 12–13
/C14C and the resulting triglycerides are liquid at room temper-
ature. Additional unsaturation introduced with linoleic (melting point, /C05/C14C) and
linolenic acid (melting point, /C011/C14C) depress the melting points of the triglycerides
even further. This structural feature ensures that the lipid/phospholipid bilayermembranes that make up the plant cell walls are able to maintain ﬂuidity in coldweather climates [ 26]. This structural variation is not as prevalent in, for instance,
palm oil, which is capable of sustaining high levels of saturated fatty acids (~49%)due to its tropical growing environment. The freezing behavior of different plantoils has been demonstrated to be related to the fatty acid composition of thetriglycerides [ 27].
The unsaturation is not conjugated in the higher unsaturated fatty acids, but are
each separated by a single carbon methylene group. This creates an allylic carbon atboth ends of the unsaturation, and the methylene bridges between oleﬁns are doublyallylic. These allylic carbons behave as built in antioxidants because they reactreadily with oxygen at ambient and elevated temperatures. The resulting allylichydroperoxides undergo spontaneous scission to generate the low molar massaldehydes that are responsible for the rancid odor of fats and oils. The degradationpathway of the fatty acids has been the subject of a great body of work due to the
impact on food quality and shelf life of food oils.
Although a number of mechanistic pathways have been proposed for the forma-
tion of these oxidized fatty acid products, the generally accepted route is throughthe Hock cleavage [ 28–33]. The exact mechanics of the Hock cleavage have been
proposed to proceed through more than one possible pathway, including intermedi-ate dioxetanes or vinyl ethers. The competitive pathways each describe the for-mation of the observed ﬁnal products. For a review of the oxidative degradation ofoleﬁns, readers are directed to an excellent review by Frimer [ 34]. Figure 6
illustrates the pathway, beginning from the rearranged initial hydroperoxide.
This oxidative degradation has signiﬁcance to the application of triglycerides in
commercial polymer applications. Many polymer products bear stringent qualityrequirements, including product odor. The natural odor of vegetable oils, which isoften intensiﬁed by heat processing, has been found to persist through some of thedifferent methods used to process the triglycerides into polyols for polyurethanes.This rancid oil odor has been a barrier to market adoption for some of the natural oilpolyol technologies. As a product quality issue, odor is experienced to different
degrees in different triglyceride polyol products, depending on the chosen trigly-
ceride oils and the particular conditions of the manufacturing process [ 35–39].324 D.A. Babb
Some producers of triglyceride-based polyols have reported the development of
odor-remediation technologies for their products, but these developments are pro-prietary and details are not available at this time.
One key requirement for biochemical feedstock utilization of these oils in many
different technologies such as biodiesel production, and production of polyurethanepolyols outlined here, is a low relative content of the saturated fatty acids. Thesaturated fats cause problems in biodiesel fuels because of a relatively high freezing
point. High saturated fat content in biodiesel fuels has been reported to cause
gumming and fuel solidiﬁcation problems in diesel automobiles, especially at highlatitudes and altitudes with cooler weather [ 40]. Similarly, saturated fats cause issues
in processing these oils into polyurethane polyols. The saturated fats are not amenableto the functionalization chemistries used to develop the desired polyol reactivity, andin most processes that use the triglyceride oils or the fatty acid methyl esters(FAMEs) that are derived from them, the saturated fats simply go through the processas non-reactive diluents. Due to their inherently non-polar nature, they can also cause
problems with formulation compatibility and can disrupt the phase segregation,
which is necessary for the proper performance of ﬂexible polyurethane polymers.In the ﬁnal polymer products the saturated fats do not contribute to network connec-tivity. For these reasons, plant-derived oils that are lower in saturated fats are moredesirable for the preparation of polyurethane polyols.

In response to this concern, many of the commercial parties involved in the
development of alternative fuel and chemical feedstock resources are investigatingnon-food sources of triglyceride oils.
The research into non-food sources of triglycerides as a potential source of cheap
and proliﬁc high conjugate carbon compounds began several years ago [ 42,43].
The US Department of Energy study concludes that low capital costs and high yieldprocesses would be required to make microalgae fuel and chemical feedstockproduction competitive with today’s petrochemical processes. Key technologyhurdles are identiﬁed as (1) identiﬁcation of microalgae species that meet severalimportant criteria, including environmental adaptability, yield, productivity, andproduct compositions; (2) deﬁnition of cultivation and resource requirements,
including temperature tolerance, nutrient demands, and water quality; and (3)
development of processing technology, including harvesting and conversion ofbiomass to desired products.
The principle product from these algae-ba sed production units is biodiesel fuel,
which is produced by the transesteriﬁ cation of triglycerides with methanol
followed by removal of glycerin in the conventional process. A key productrequirement for biodiesel is a high level o f unsaturated fatty acids in the source
triglycerides, at least for the production of biodiesel that can be used year-round at
higher latitudes [ 44]. The volumes of polyols used in polyurethanes are extremely
small when compared to the potential vol umes of biodiesel as fuel for trans-
portation, so speciﬁcations for high unsat uration in oils from algae for chemical
feedstocks are not likely to drive trends i n the technology. Fortuitously, in this
case, the key chemical feedstock requirements for low saturated fat coincide withthe similar speciﬁcation for biodiesel f uels, and this coincidence creates an
opportunity for such oils in the chemistri es described here for the preparation of
polyols for polyurethanes.
Recent research into the use of algae as a fuel source has begun to make a
stronger case for the qualities of algae as a raw material source [ 45]. Both public
and proprietary sources of developmental algae triglycerides have successfullypropagated algae with high oleic acid content in the oils, making these varietiesof algae attractive for both fuel and chemical feedstock interests, at least withregard to product composition [ 46]. Figure 7illustrates the gas chromatography
analysis of triglyceride collected from one species of algae under development.Table 2lists the identities and quantities of the identiﬁed fatty acids that were
isolated from the algae source. Some work has already been published on the
functionalization of algae triglycerides for industrial purposes [ 47].
Many different process approaches to growing algae for feedstock oils and
biodiesel are being considered, including open pond techniques, growth in giantphotoreactors (large transparent circulation loops in which triglyceride productionis promoted via CO
2sequestration and photosynthesis), and even in closed systems
where the algae is fed carbohydrate nutrients [ 48] instead of the conventional
photosynthetic technique. The number of commercial and federally subsidized
programs pursuing this attractive area of research is too long to list here, and the326 D.A. Babb
technology options being investigated is outside the scope of this text. There are
many skeptics on the topic of algae as a viable source of energy and chemical
feedstock, and the debate over the thermodynamics and economics of the potentialprocesses continues to this day [ 49]. Ultimately, the competitive hurdles that must
be overcome to make any approach commercially viable will determine the surviv-ability of these processes.Table 2 Fatty acid methyl esters in biodiesel

3.3 Naturally Hydroxylated Seed Oils
Some plants produce triglyceride oils with naturally appended hydroxyl groups,
which are capable of reacting directly with isocyanates to produce polyurethanes.Of these oils, the two most common are castor oil and lesquerella oil, both of whichare the subject of ongoing research and development for industrial applications.
3.3.1 Castor Oil
Castor oil is derived from the castor plant ( Ricinus communis ). The castor plant
has a long and rich history of uses in human society. The oil from the plant is non-digestible, and is commonly known to be a medicinal purgative. The castor beancontains the protein ricin, a substance that is famously toxic in humans [ 50]. The
lack of food value from the castor plant coupled with the issues of toxicity inherent
in extraction of ricin has mostly limited the use of castor oil to the industrial sector.
The castor plant is widely considered to be a nuisance plant, because it
proliferates rapidly in poor, depleted soils that cannot sustain other more importantcommercial crops. It spreads quickly as a weed, and in some places has been listedas an intrusive species to be eliminated [ 51,52]. Nevertheless, in recent years the
industrial volume of castor oil has increased dramatically, driven primarily by theglobal interest in renewable resources for fuel and feedstocks as an alternative to
petrochemicals. The majority of the volume growth has come from the Asian
continent, primarily from India, where the castor plant is harvested commercially[53]. In addition to its direct use in polyurethane products, the oil and its com-
ponents have been the focus of innovative new derivatization strategies to improvetheir properties for use in plastics, while retaining high levels of renewable contentin the ﬁnal products. These developments will be described in Section 4.5.
Castor oil is a triglyceride that is well suited for use in polyurethane applications.
Unlike most other oil-producing plants, the castor plant produces a triglyceride
containing >90% of a single fatty acid, that being ricinoleic acid. Ricinoleic acid
contains secondary hydroxyl groups appended to the C
18fatty acid backbone
(Fig. 8).
The high percentage of ricinoleic acid in the triglyceride, coupled with the
presence of a single hydroxyl group on each ricinoleic acid makes the triglyceridevery nearly 3.0 functional in OH groups directly as isolated from the plant. Thecomponent ricinoleic acid is an important component in lithium grease and otherindustrial lubricants [ 54–56].
Castor oil has been used in polyurethanes for decades. The natural abundance of
castor, combined with the inherent proper functionality of the oil, has led to the
OH O
OH Fig. 8 Ricinoleic acid328 D.A. Babb
widespread use of castor oil in the polyurethanes industry as a low-cost component
to reduce the overall price of ﬂexible foam formulations [ 57], and to impart
improved moisture resistance and weatherability to coatings and elastomers
[58–63].
Much work has been done on the incorporation of castor oil into polyurethane
formulations, including ﬂexible foams [ 64], rigid foams [ 65], and elastomers [ 66].
Castor oil derivatives have also been investigated, by the isolation of methylricinoleate from castor oil, in a fashion similar to that used for the preparation ofbiodiesel. The methyl ricinoleate is then transesteriﬁed to a synthetic triol, and thechain simultaneously extended by homo-polymerization to provide polyols of1,000–4,000 molecular weight. Polyurethane elastomers were then prepared by
reaction with MDI. It was determined that lower hardness and tensile/elongation
properties could be related to the formation of cyclization products that are com-mon to polyester polyols, or could be due to monomer dehydration, which is aknown side reaction of ricinoleic acid [ 67]. Both side reactions limit the growth of
polyol molecular weight.
One of the more advanced technical offerings from castor oil is a line of
polyester diols, triols, and higher functional polyols derived from 100% castor oilas products for the preparation of polyurethane prepolymers and elastomers [ 68].
The Polycin line of polyols are prepared by transesteriﬁcation of ricinoleic acid and
derivatives. The producers (Vertellus) offer diol and triol products, as well as arecently developed series of diol and triol glyceryl ricinoleate esters that are statedto be prepared from 100% castor oil, making them fully renewable in content. Theproducts are recommended for coatings, sealants, and adhesive applications.
3.3.2 Lesquerella Oil
Lesquerella oil is a lesser known, naturally hydroxylated seed oil that is derived
from the genus Lesquerella . Of many different wild species, Lesquerella fendleri is
currently the only species being developed for commercial evaluation [ 69]. The
plant is native to the southwestern USA, and is typical in mildly alkaline, arid soils.Some attempts to investigate the adaptation of L. fendleri [70–72] to a wider
environment have indicated that the plant is not widely adaptable. Low adaptability,combined with difﬁcult oil recovery and moderate acreage yield of the oil may belimiting factors in the broad commercial development of lesquerella oil.
TheLesquerella seed yields roughly 20–25 % oil by weight. The functional fatty
acid from the proﬁle is mainly the 20-carbon lesquerolic acid, or 14-hydroxy-11-eicosenoic acid (Fig. 9).
The parallels to castor oil and ricinoleic acid are clear. Some important
differences exist. The hydroxylated fatty acids (hydroxyeicosenoic acid and
OH O
OH Fig. 9 Lesquerolic acidPolyurethanes from Renewable Resources 329
hydroxyeicosadienoic acid) are ~57% by weight of the balance of fatty acids in the
seed triglyceride. Increasing the percentage of lesquerolic acid content in the oil isa focus of agricultural development [ 69]. The yield of oil in tons per acre is lower
than for castor, and at this point in time Lesquerella is not adaptable to a diverse
range of global environments. However, the seeds of Lesquerella are not inherently
poisonous, and the seed meal contains ~35% protein, making it a viable candidatefor agricultural feed. Lesquerella is also not currently a food crop, making it a good
candidate for the development of petrochemical feedstocks.
There are a few reports on the development of lesquerolic acid derivatives being
used for the preparation of polyurethanes, with most of the success being in thedevelopment of high quality urethane coatings [ 73–79]. This is a typical sequence
for the development of new natural feedstocks for polyurethane polymers, with
coatings coming before the development of other products with more demandingprocessing requirements. Because of the similarity of Lesquerella to castor, further
reﬁnement of the genus could lead to more commercially interesting cultivars.
4 Strategies for Derivatization and Commercial Use
of Triglycerides as Polyols
The direct use of naturally hydroxylated triglyceride oils in polyurethanes is limited
by the performance compromises at higher loadings of oil in the formulations.Several chemical derivation strategies have been pursued in an attempt to increasethe amount of renewable carbon in commercial polyurethanes while sustaining thehigh performance that is expected from polyurethane products. Some of these stra-tegies proceed from naturally hydroxylated oils, and some begin from commodityfood oils such as soybean oil, canola oil, or sunﬂower oil. Figure 10illustrates the
strategies that result in derivatization of triglycerides to polyols for polyurethanes.
4.1 Blown Oils (Air Oxidation)
The simplest of the chemically processed renewable oils for use in polyurethanesare the drying oils, the “bodied” or “blown” oils, so called because the process forproducing them consists of blowing hot air through conventional seed oils, com-monly linseed or soybean oil [ 80]. Blown oils are distinctly different from “stand”
oils (primarily prepared from linseed oil), which are cured and thickened thermally
in the absence of oxygen, thus precluding the formation of ethers, additionalhydroxyl groups, and the other oxidation products that render the blown oilsreactive in polyurethane formulations.
The blown oils have been used in the coatings industry for decades, and are prin-
cipally used in the preparation of drying oils for protective coatings. The process of330 D.A. Babb
treating oils with hot air in order to advance the polymer curing and increase
viscosity is a standard process. Linseed oil (from ﬂax) is highly utilized for coatings
because the high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (see Table 1) leads to a more
rapid curing via the oxidative coupling chemistry.
The blowing process results in a cascade of chain coupling and chain scission
chemistries that are initiated by hydroperoxide formation. The ensuing oxidationresults in an overall increase in the viscosity of the oil mixture, while simulta-neously generating some hydroxyl functionality in the oil, enhancing the reactivityin polymer applications. The fatty acid hydroperoxides thermally decompose toform conjugated radicals that combine or add to other sites of unsaturation to form
fatty acid oligomers linked by ether groups or by carbon–carbon bonds from radical
coupling. The high concentration of allylic hydrogens ensures that the rate of chaintransfer greatly exceeds chain propagation, so that the growth of molecular weightresembles the step-growth polymerization of a high functionality monomer. Theresulting polyol product grows in molecular weight and functionality, with a largeand diverging polydispersity, while simultaneously containing mostly unreactedtriglyceride. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis in Fig. 11demon-
strates the difference between reﬁned soybean oil triglyceride and the sol fraction of
the product of a soybean oil air-oxidation process [ 81].
In recent years, blown oils have found their way into the polyurethane industry.
The additional hydroxyl content introduced through the oxidation process makesthe oils more reactive toward isocyanates [ 82]. The oils can usually be incorporated
at low levels into conventional formulations with little compromise to the mechan-ical properties of the ﬁnished polyurethanes. Blown oils have since found utility incarpet backing, insulation foams, and other polyurethane products [ 83]. At least aAir oxidation

few patents are to be found that relate the use of blown oils in polyurethane polymer
applications [ 84–88]. One interesting extension of the blown oil chemistry is found
in a patent ﬁled by Bayer Materials Science, disclosing the alkoxylation of blownoils (provided by Urethane Soy Systems) by reaction with PO using the DMCcatalyst [ 89]. Generally, foams were somewhat softer (lower indentation force) and
had slightly lower tear strength when compared to control foams prepared from apolyether triol of 3,000 molecular weight.
4.2 Ozonolysis
The ozonolysis of oleﬁns has been studied for over 60 years, and is still the subjectof current research. The principle interest lies in the complex mechanism of dipolaradditions, chain scissions, and recombinations that are the source of the complexity
Fig. 11 GPC chromatogram of ( 1) soy oil and ( 2) soy polyol. Reproduced from [ 81]b y

of ozonolysis products. Following many years of product characterizations and
mechanistic hypotheses, the currently accepted mechanism is that proposed byCriegee in 1975 [ 90–92]. The original Criegee reference provides details of the
complexity of the ozonolysis process and products, and readers are directed to the
original reference [ 90] and following references [ 91,92] for a more thorough
development of this interesting organic synthesis.
The ozonolysis mechanism was recently studied again via the use of
17O isotope
labeling, following the suggestion from previous research [ 93], and also by spec-
troscopic and chromatographic methods [ 94]. Authors of the recent study obtained
results that are consistent with the previously published oxidation mechanisms.Figure 12outlines the oxidative degradation and cleavage pathway that is outlined
in reference [ 94].
Ozonolysis has been applied to the oxidative functionalization of triglycerides.
Papers and reviews, and a few patents, have been issued on the ozonolysis of seedoils for the production of plastics [ 95,96]. Theoretically, the oxidation products that
are accessible via ozonolysis of fatty acid esters are the same as those that areisolated from the photo-induced singlet oxygen cleavage of the same substrates, viaHock cleavage [ 28–33]. The mixture of products that come from the ozonolysis of
Fig. 12 The process of oleﬁn oxidation and chain cleavage. Reproduced from [ 94] by permission
of Association of Chemical Engineers of SerbiaPolyurethanes from Renewable Resources 333
fatty acids is dependent on the speciﬁc conditions of the process, including temper-
ature, reaction solvent (if any), and the degree of completion of the ozonolysis. Theprinciple products are always chain cleavage products, directed at scission through
the oleﬁns within the target molecule. The saturated fatty acids that occur naturally
in the seed oils are inert to ozone. The ozonolysis of seed oil triglycerides creates amixture of many compounds.
The mixture of the reaction products can be shifted from oxidation to reduction
products depending on the method chosen to work up the reaction mixture, and caninclude chain scission products such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylicacids, and diacids.
The collection of products from the ozonolysis of seed oils can be challenging to
use in plastic products directly as prepared by ozonolysis and work-up, but may
be more amenable to the isolation of individual components (diols, diacids) fromwhich a predictable stoichiometry then can be derived [ 97–99].
One recently successful development in ozonolysis has been obtained by Petrovic
et al., using the mild ozonolysis of trilinolein, canola, and soybean oil [ 100]. The
ozonolysis was carried out under cryogenic conditions ( /C034 to /C040
/C14C) as a 10%
solution in methylene chloride, followed by reductive work-up with sodium borohy-dride to provide primary alcohol-terminated triglycerides. The resulting low mole-
cular weight polyols were waxy solids at room temperature, which is typical of
polyester polyols. The authors report high conversion and high yields of the corres-ponding alcohols, and the thermal and mechanical analyses of the resulting MDI-based polyurethane elastomers were consistent with high molecular weight polymers.Figure 13illustrates the compounds prepared in these studies [ 100].
4.3 Epoxidized Oils
The epoxidation of vegetable oil triglycerides is a well-known technology.
Epoxidized vegetable oils found use in other industrial applications before their

enlistment as a source of polyols for polyurethanes. Epoxidized soybean oil (ESO)
and the acrylated form of ESO have been used as photocurable inks and coatings[101], and as base stock resin for sheet molding compounds [ 102]. ESO and
epoxidized linseed oil have been used as reactive plasticizers in epoxy resins and
in compounded PVC [ 103], as well as in latex coatings, [ 104], as base stock for
industrial lubricants [ 105–108], and recently as a precursor to soaps [ 109].
Many companies, such as Cognis, ICC Chemical, Arkema, Sartomer, Ferro
Corp. and Varteco Quimica offer commercial grades of ESO, which are ready foruse or for further chemical derivation.
There are two sources of epoxidized triglycerides, the ﬁrst is the isolation of
naturally epoxidized oils, and the other is the preparation of epoxidized trigly-
cerides via oxidation of the more readily available unsaturated seed oils.
4.3.1 Naturally Epoxidized Triglycerides
The obvious advantage of allowing nature to perform the derivation of commer-
cially interesting raw materials is the motivation behind the cultivation of naturallyoccurring epoxidized oils. Similar to castor oil, these plant oils are not digestibleand cannot be used as cooking oils and, discounting their questionable medicinalvalue, their only interest to humans is for industrial purposes. The broad commer-cial application of epoxidized vegetable oils, which are produced industrially byoxidation of vegetable oils after conventional reﬁning, creates an incentive to avoid
the costly oxidation process by isolating the epoxidized oils directly from the
agricultural source. Although there is currently no large volume source of naturallyderived epoxidized oils, there are technically sound sources of oils that are underdevelopment for their potential as viable additions to our commercial agriculture.Naturally epoxidized seed oils are common to the two genuses Vernonia and
Euphorbia ; the principle fatty acid component of interest is known as vernolic
acid and is illustrated in Fig. 14. The two species are both the subject of agricultural
development programs in their respective geographies.
Vernonia Oil
Vernonia oil is most commonly derived from the plant species Vernonia galamensis
(ironweed), which is a weed native to eastern Ethiopia. It was originally identiﬁedonly in 1964 [ 110]. The seed contains roughly 40% oil by weight, and the oil
contains as much as 80% vernolic acid. The oil is very low in saturated palmitic andstearic acids, making it a high yield source of the epoxy acid of interest [ 111]. The
principle triglyceride from Vernonia is trivernolin, which contains three vernolic

acid groups esteriﬁed to glycerin. The triglyceride has been demonstrated to be
versatile and amenable to extensive chemical derivation [ 112]. The high content of
epoxy functionality in the oil has enabled its use as a feedstock for direct conversion
to the acrylate and methacrylate derivatives for copolymerization in epoxy resin
formulations [ 113].
The saponiﬁcation of vernonia oil followed by recombination with glycerin
has been demonstrated to provide a mixed oligomeric polyol that is useful for thepreparation of rigid polyurethane foams [ 114]. The inventors disclose that polyols
prepared in this manner have the advantage of a lower formulation viscosity com-pared to conventional polyethers with comparable hydroxyl content. The lowerviscosity is advantageous in promoting uniform foam ﬂow during rigid foam
formation. Preparation of the vernonia oil polyol is outlined in Fig. 15[114].
The ring opening can be carried out using alcohols, carboxylic acids, or other
nucleophiles in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, or optionally with hydrogen orwater at elevated temperatures and pressures (150–250
/C14C, 1–100 bar) to provide a
highly functionalized polyol, which has been demonstrated in rigid polyurethanefoams [ 115].
At least one study has compared vernonia oil to partially epoxidized soybean and
linseed oils, to investigate claims that vernonia oil is advantaged due to inherently
lower viscosity. Authors conclude that partially epoxidized soybean and linseed oils
have viscosity and reactivity that are similar to vernonia oil in formulated coatingsystems, and provide improvements to viscosity, content of volatile organic com-pounds (VOCs), and curing time in alkyd coatings when compared to conventionalformulations and formulations containing fully epoxidized soybean oil [ 116].

Euphorbia Oil
Euphorbia lagascae has recently raised interest as a potential new plant for
industrial development [ 117]. Euphorbia has a high abundance of vernolic acid in
the triglyceride (58–78%) and a high percentage of oil in the seed crop (~50% byweight). Euphorbia has some traits that create challenges for cultivation andharvesting, including indeterminate growth (growth that is not terminated) and along maturity season, which will ultimately limit the range where the plants can begrown to the lower latitudes. It also has the unpleasant disadvantage of producinglatex, which makes automated harvesting difﬁcult and potentially impacts the yield[118]. The plant has at least one registered commercial cultivar (Vernola), devel-
oped cooperatively by Centro de Investigacio´n y Desarrollo Agroalimentario
(Murcia, Spain) and Institut f €ur Pﬂanzenbau und Pﬂanzenz €uchtung (G €ottingen,
Germany). Vernola has the advantage that the seed pods do not split open uponmaturity (indehiscence), as is normal for the native varieties [ 119]. Efforts are now
underway to deﬁne environmental adaptability and trait expression as a function ofgrowing conditions.
One species of Euphorbia in Brazil ( Bernardia pulchella ) has been determined
to contain more than 90% vernolic acid in the triglyceride [ 120]. This level of
single-component purity is equivalent to the level of ricinoleic acid typically found
in castor oil. These different varieties of epoxidized oil plants will probablycontinue to be the subject of agricultural development in the coming years.
4.3.2 Synthetic Epoxidized Triglycerides
The formation of oxirane functionality from the unsaturation in seed oil trigly-
cerides is a more chemically speciﬁc process than several of the processes previ-ously discussed. The epoxidation is carried out directly from the triglyceride oils,by combination with an oxidizing agent, typically peroxyacetic acid or hydrogenperoxide in a carrier such as methanol, formic acid, or acetic acid [ 121–123].
The oxidation is relatively speciﬁc, and is run under mild enough conditions to
prevent the over-oxidation of the fatty acids. Figure 16shows the epoxidation of
triglyceride oils with any of a variety of oxidizing agents.
The epoxidation is followed by opening of the oxirane with acid hydrolysis
(such as phosphoric acid or acetic acid) o r a nucleophile (such as methoxide or
acetate) to form a secondary alcohol [ 124]. Oxirane ring opening results from
attack of a nucleophile on one of the car bons of the three-membered ring. The
reaction is referred to in some publications and several patents as the “hydroxyl-
ation” step of the polyol synthesis. The opening of the oxirane generates a
secondary alcohol. This alcohol is als o a nucleophile, and can attack another
oxirane to generate an ether linkage between two fatty acid moieties, along with anew alcohol. This side reaction results in oligomerization of the fatty acids [ 125], and
thus a broadening of the polydispersity index (weight-average molecular weight/number-average molecular weight, M
w/Mn) of the triglyceride polyol [ 126].Polyurethanes from Renewable Resources 337
The resulting polyol resembles the product that is hypothesized for the oligomeri-
zation of triglycerides via air oxidation, with the exception that there is a largeincrease in the hydroxyl content of the polyol product, and there is very little, if any,of the starting epoxide left unreacted. In addition, the epoxidation process does not
produce low molecular weight chain scission products, which are a by-product of
the blown oil process. The hydroxylation of epoxidized triglycerides is illustrated inFig.17.
A structural analysis of the product that results from this approach to the
preparation of triglyceride polyols has been described in at least one elegantinvestigation [ 125]. Authors found evidence for polyethers in the backbone of the
ring-opened epoxy oil, consistent with the attack of the triglyceride alcohol on anepoxy ring. Figure 18illustrates the
1H NMR analysis of the polyol oligomer.
When the epoxidation/hydroxylation process is performed on oils with multiple
unsaturation sites, the resulting oligomerization produces polyol chains withhyperbranching and high average functionality per polyol chain [ 127]. Figure 19
illustrates the MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry) analysis of the oligomeric product described in refer-ence [ 125].
The desire to minimize this competitive oligomerization has motivated research
into alternative means to decrease the polydispersity and simultaneously increase
the molecular weight of the seed-oil derived polyols. Recent patents [ 128,129]
investigate an approach previously demonstrated for the hydroformylated polyols[130–132], i.e., hydroxylation of the fatty acid alkyl ester followed by polymeriza-
tion from a petrochemically derived initiator molecule. Inventors state that thisapproach provides an improvement over previous epoxidized/hydroxylated polyolsby allowing better control of the molecular weight and the functionality of thepolyol products.OxO

One interesting study determined the reaction kinetics of the oxirane opening in
glacial acetic acid, in an attempt to minimized degradation products during oxiraneformation, and provide a lower distribution of product molecular weights [ 133]. It
was demonstrated that the degree of oligomerization of ESO can be controlled withthe selection of nucleophilic oxirane-opening agent, and that the resulting function-ality of the ESO polyol can be controlled in this manner. The relationship betweenthe functionality of the polyols and the tensile strength of the resulting polyurethaneelastomers was directly proportional [ 134].
ESO derivatives, with the secondary alcohol functionality situated midway
down the 18-carbon backbone of the fatty acid, typically display reaction rateswith polyisocyanates that are considerably slower than the reaction rate of a similarfatty acid substituted with a primary hydroxyl in the same position [ 135], or even
more slowly than polyols prepared with secondary OH groups derived from PO[136]. The exact reason for this has not been proven, but steric accessibility is high
on the list of probable inﬂuences. The slower reactivity of epoxidized/hydroxylatedtriglycerides creates challenges in the processing of foams in commercial produc-
tion equipment in some higher volume, more demanding polyurethane product
applications. Enhancement to reactivity of these ESO-based polyols has motivatedresearch into increasing the primary hydroxyl content by derivation of the ESOpolyols with primary alcohols [ 135].
The ready availability of ESO has contributed strongly to the commercial
development of polyurethane polyols derived from this chemistry. Of all theapproaches to developing renewable polyols for polyurethane applications, the

derivations of epoxidized seed oils constitute the most commonly available pro-
ducts. A growing body of patents is emerging, assigned to companies such asHobum (Merginol polyols), Cargill (BiOH polyols) [ 137,138], BioBased
Technologies (Agrol polyols) [ 122,123] as well as non-commercial entities such
as Pittsburg State University [ 139,140]. Formulation experience and product
development will no doubt bring continued product introductions to this ﬁeld ofpolyol offerings.
4.4 Hydroformylated Oils
Hydroformylation is the process of coupling carbon monoxide to an oleﬁn witha reductive catalyst and hydrogen to produce an aldehyde-functionalized sub-strate. This coupling is typically followed by hydrogenation to produce a primaryhydroxyl group. Several academic and commercial programs have participated inthe development of hydroformylated triglycerides and fatty acid derivatives for usein polyurethanes. Two main processes for the hydroformylation of seed oils have
been utilized.
When triglycerides are used as the substrate, the ﬁnal product is a triglyceride
functionalized with hydroxymethyl groups. One hydroformylation process uses theless expensive cobalt catalyst, requires more harsh process conditions, and gener-ally results in lower yields of the aldehyde products. This approach wasinvestigated by Petrovic et al. at the Pittsburg State University [ 141]. The typical
reaction scheme is outlined in Fig. 20.
Another approach begins with the isolation of methyl esters of fatty acids from
triglycerides with concurrent liberation of glycerin. This is the commercial process
Fig. 20 Hydroxymethyl-functionalized triglycerides, ultimately formate esteriﬁed. Reproduced
from [ 141] by permission of John Wiley and SonsPolyurethanes from Renewable Resources 341
for the preparation of biodiesel [ 142]. The biodiesel fatty acid methyl esters
(FAMEs) are then treated with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence ofrhodium catalyst to form the intermediate aldehyde. Hydrogenation of the aldehyde
provides quantitative conversion to the mixture of hydroxymethyl fatty acid methyl
esters, which serve as A–B
nmonomers for further polymerization, where A is the
methyl ester group, B is the hydroxymethyl group, and B ndesignates the average
number nof hydroxymethyl groups per fatty acid, which is controlled by the
hydroformylation process. The hydroxymethyl monomer is then combined with aselected initiator, which is chosen to ﬁt the intended ﬁnal application for the polyolproduct. Methanol from the polyol polymerization is then recycled back again tomake biodiesel. The strategy is outlined in Fig. 21.
The hydrogenation step following hydroformylation serves two important
purposes. It reduces the aldehyde intermediate product to the desired primaryalcohol functional group, which is the primary site of reactivity of the polyol withisocyanates. It also reduces the residual oleﬁns in the FAMEs to saturatedhydrocarbons, thus eliminating the pathway to Hock degradation and odor devel-opment, which is inherent to other processes that leave fatty acid unsaturation in thepolyols. This step eliminates the typical vegetable oil odor from the ﬁnal natural oilpolyols of this process.
The hydroxymethyl-substituted methyl esters can then be transesteriﬁed with
any number of different initiator types to tailor the structure of the polyol to the end-use application, and all from a single raw material source. The stoichiometry of thepolyol is adjustable, to produce polyols of any molecular weight. This syntheticstrategy was developed by The Dow Chemical Company as the Renuva polyols.

The resulting slate of polyols has been demonstrated in conventional ﬂexible
slabstock foam [ 143], viscoelastic foam [ 144], and high resiliency slabstock and
molded foams [ 145].
In 2006, Dow performed a detailed Life Cycle Analysis study of the process for
producing Renuva polyols [ 146]. The study determined that the process of reﬁning
soybean oil through to the polyols of this process was a net-sum zero generator ofCO
2. The boundaries of the analysis included growth, harvesting, and transporta-
tion of the soybeans; reﬁning of the vegetable oil; and processing to ﬁnal polyol.In addition, the process to ﬁnal polyol only uses 42% of the fossil fuel resourcestypical of a petrochemical polyol process.
4.5 Alkoxylated Triglyceride Oils
As mentioned previously, castor oil has been used directly in polyurethane formu-lations for decades. The triglyceride plant oil has a molecular weight of appro-ximately 1,000, which is an atypical molecular weight for triols in polyurethaneapplications. A more typical molecular weight range of polyether polyols forapplications in ﬂexible foams such as bedding and furniture is 3,000–4,500.Although acceptable foam performance has been demonstrated by incorporatinglow levels of castor oil directly into formulations, one innovative way to makecastor more useful for quality performance applications is to alkoxylate the castor
triglyceride with PO, just as conventional polyethers are alkoxylated from glycerin,
up to a higher and more useful molecular weight. This optionally can be done withpure PO or a mixture of oxides such as EO and PO.
This type of alkoxylation chemistry cannot be performed with conventional
alkali metal hydroxide catalysts because the hydroxide will saponify the triglycer-ide ester groups under typical alkoxylation reaction conditions. Similar competitivehydrolysis occurs with alternative catalysts such as triﬂic acid or other Brønstedacid/base catalysis. Efﬁcient alkoxylation in the absence of signiﬁcant side reac-
tions requires a coordination catalyst such as the DMC catalyst zinc hexacyano-
cobaltate. DMC catalysts have been under development for years [ 147–150], but
have recently begun to gain more commercial implementation. The use of the DMCcatalyst in combination with castor oil as an initiator has led to at least two lines ofcommercial products for the ﬂexible foam market. Lupranol Balance 50 (BASF)and Multranol R-3524 and R-3525 (Bayer) are used for ﬂexible slabstock foamsand are produced by the direct alkoxylation of castor oil.
BASF has published the results of a Life-Cycle Analysis environmental study
of the commercial manufacturing process for Lupranol Balance 50 polyol [ 151].
The study indicates a positive trend on the environmental impact of manufacturingthe polyols by the new process. The actual impact of the current offering isdifﬁcult to gauge from this study, since in some cases the theoretical improvementsPolyurethanes from Renewable Resources 343
of the process are calculated on the basis of 100% replacement of all ﬂexible foam
demand from NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) participatingcountries, based on 2007 market data.
5 Biodegradability
Only one prominent study has been performed on the biodegradation of polyur-ethanes based on triglyceride polyols [ 152]. The study indicates that the biodegrad-
ability of polymers such as oxidatively polymerized seed oils is rapid under normalconditions in the soil, but that conversion of these same triglycerides to polymerscontaining amine and urethane linkages essentially eliminates short-term biodegra-dation. Polymer degradation was studied by respirometry in soil samples, and was
compared to soybean oil as a control. Figure 22illustrates the result of the study,
and indicates that the synthetic polymers all have substantially lower decomposi-tion rates as compared to the native soybean oil.

6 Characterization of Renewable Content in Polyurethanes
As renewable raw materials began to enter the marketplace, it was inevitable that
claims to the level of renewable content in commercial offerings would become anissue of public debate. As previously pointed out in this article, some renewable rawmaterials have been common to the polyol chemistry for many decades, so claimsto at least some renewable content are justiﬁed. Because the commercialization ofdifferent renewable polyol chemistries has created a highly competitive environ-ment, some scientists in the ﬁeld have promoted a method for the independentveriﬁcation of the renewable sourced carbon in the ﬁnal product [ 153]. ASTM
International has published a concise and informative brieﬁng paper on the method
development for the determination of renewable carbon content in carbon-containing substances [ 154]. The method involves the analysis of
14C content in
the ﬁnished polyurethane products via radiocarbon dating [ 155]. The technique is
fast and accurate, and has become commonly available by contract analysis throughindependent analytical laboratories [ 156].
The method builds on the fundamentals of radiocarbon dating via
14C analysis,
an analytical method that relies on the nuclear decay of radioactive carbon that is
incorporated from the atmosphere into all living, respiring plants. The14C is present
in the atmosphere as14CO 2. The level of14C is extremely low, only one part
per trillion of the natural abundance of carbon in the atmosphere. When plantrespiration ceases, the uptake of
14CO 2stops, but the slow radioactive decay of
14C continues. Accurate detection of the amount of14C in a natural organic
substance allows calculation of the age of the sample. This radioactive isotope ofcarbon undergoes beta decay with a relatively short half-life of approximately5,730 years. The sensitivity of detection makes the quantiﬁcation of
14C applicable
to specimens dating back as far as approximately 50,000 years.
The radiocarbon method works because even though14C is lost through nuclear
decay, it is constantly replenished at a rate that offsets the rate of loss. The twolighter isotopes of carbon (
12C and13C) are formed in the normal process of nuclear
fusion in stars, through which most elements are formed [ 157,158]. This is not
the case for14C, which is formed primarily through bombardment of nitrogen with
cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere [ 159]. The accuracy of radiocarbon dating
rests on the assumption that the ﬂux of cosmic rays into the upper atmosphere has
been relatively stable on a geological time scale, thus maintaining a relatively
constant concentration of14C. One recent investigation has determined that atmo-
spheric14C concentrations have been more variable than previously considered.
The study provides a detailed map of14C concentrations across the full range of
the useful timescale accessible through the dating technique (~50,000 years), andshould contribute to the continuing reﬁnement of the accuracy of the method [ 160].
It should be stressed that the reﬁnement of accuracy of the radioisotope datingmethod is only peripherally related to the determination of renewable content, since
freshly harvested plant carbon has a complete complement of
14C, and petroleum-
based carbon has essentially none. By simply ratioing the amount of14Ci naPolyurethanes from Renewable Resources 345
synthetic article to the natural14C abundance, the ratio of renewable carbon is
calculated.
7 Applications for Polyurethanes with Renewable Content
7.1 Flexible Foams
Flexible foams are the largest segment of the polyurethane global market. They fall
into several different categories based on end-use markets and performance require-ments. Most people are aware of the applications of polyurethane foam in bedding(mattresses, pillows) and furniture (cushions, bolsters), and in automotive seating.In addition, ﬂexible foam is used in other applications such as carpet backing [ 161],
many applications in automotive interiors [ 162], clothing, noise abatement, protec-
tive packaging, and even ﬁltration. Each of these application areas has speciﬁcperformance criteria that separate them from the other classes of ﬂexible foams.The goal to produce polyols to meet the variety of application demands for ﬂexiblefoams alone is a signiﬁcant challenge for polyol producers.
7.1.1 Flexible Slabstock Foams
Three main competitive technologies have entered the commercial arena in the area
of conventional ﬂexible slabstock foams. Alkoxylated castor oil polyols (such asthe BASF product Lupranol Balance 50) [ 151], epoxidized/hydroxylated trigly-
cerides (such as the Cargill BiOH polyols) [ 163], and the polyols based on
hydroformylated/hydrogenated biodiesel (such as The Dow Chemical CompanyRenuva polyols) [ 130–132]. Large-scale foam producers such as Foamex, Recticel,
Carpenter, and Sanko Espuma are adopting the manufacture of foams based on
renewable polyols as OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) for mattresses and
furniture are launching product lines containing polyurethane foam with renewablecontent. For further information visit the commercial literature of these and otherpolyurethane foam producers.
Flexible slabstock foam is one of the largest application areas of polyurethane
polyols, encompassing applications in bedding, furniture, clothing, packaging, anda long list of smaller volume specialized applications. Conventional ﬂexible slab-stock foam is therefore an attractive market segment for large-scale polyol pro-
ducers who seek to gain economically competitive cost structure through the
improved economics of large scale manufacturing (economy of scale). Commercialﬂexible slabstock polyols are often required to meet very demanding performancespeciﬁcations for the processing and production of the foam (experienced by thefoam manufacturer) and for the performance of the foam in the ﬁnal application.These performance criteria are so speciﬁc that virtually any change to the chemistry346 D.A. Babb
of the components of the formulation has a measurable impact on either foam
processing or performance, or both. A thorough understanding of the changes topolyol performance that result from the inclusion of biorenewable polyols is a
crucial step on the path to commercial offering and market adoption of these new
materials.
A well-controlled foaming study of epoxidized/hydroxylated triglyceride
polyols in low-density slabstock grade foams was performed by Zhang et al.[164] and was based on polyols prepared by the Kansas Polymer Research Center
[165]. The preparative method used for the polyol allowed a reduction in the com-
petitive oligomerization of the polyol, resulting in a relatively lower amount ofoligomeric polyol, seen when the GPC analysis is compared to that of the blown oil
polyol (Fig. 10). An idealized structure of the polyol, along with a GPC analysis is
represented in Fig. 23.
Authors carefully investigated the potential causes of an increase in compressive
modulus, which had been previously reported for ﬂexible slabstock foams preparedfrom the polyols of the study [ 166]. Flexible foams prepared from a standard
formulation containing two different levels of the epoxidized/hydroxylated soybean
Fig. 23 Idealized structure of the soybean oil polyol ( top) and GPC trace of soybean oil polyol
used in the study ( bottom ). Reproduced from [ 164] by permission of Elsevier PressPolyurethanes from Renewable Resources 347
oil polyol were compared to foam from a control polyether polyol foam containing
a commercial styrene/acrylonitrile copolymer polyether polyol (a polyol-dispersedreinforcing polymer), and foam from a formulation containing a low molecular
weight crosslinker. By a combination of thermal and mechanical analyses, small-
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, infrared analysis, and atom force microscopy(AFM) surface analysis of hard and soft domain size and disposition, it was demon-strated that hard domain size is smaller in the foams prepared from the natural oilpolyol, and that there is a lower contrast between hard and soft domains (suggestingmore phase mixing). Contributions to higher modulus are proposed to be the higherinherent T
gof the natural oil polyol ( /C035/C14C versus /C068/C14C for the polyether) and
the increased interfacial boundary between the hard and soft domains that
constrains a higher percentage of the soft domain at the interface.
Foams prepared from the soybean oil polyol exhibited low temperature soft
segment thermal transition (using dynamic mechanical analysis, DMA) at the sametemperature as the control polyether foam. Scanning to a higher temperature did notreveal clean, well-deﬁned second transitions corresponding to a second soft seg-ment phase, but instead indicated a broad transition to lower storage modulus,which became broader and less well deﬁned as the soy polyol content was increased.This appears to indicate a degree of phase compatibility between the soybean
oil polyol and the conventional polyether that is somewhat short of complete
miscibility. Figure 24illustrates the DMA analyses for these foams.
Foam hardness is an important property of ﬂexible foams because foam
producers typically segregate grades of foam on the basis of the combination offoam hardness and density [ 163]. Foam formulations that can increase foam
hardness without increasing density, or without the addition of hardening additives
Fig. 24 DMA results for ( a) control foam, ( d) 10% soybean oil polyol, and ( e) 30% soybean oil
polyol. Reproduced from [ 164] by permission of Elsevier Press348 D.A. Babb
such as copolymer polyol, potentially bring value to the foam producer. However,
these improvements cannot be adopted at the expense of other important perfor-
mance features. Although properties speciﬁcally related to foam resiliency were not
discussed in the foam study by Zhang et al., the tan d(G00/G0) values of the natural
oil foams were demonstrated to be higher than those of the control polyetherfoam in the region of room temperature, and an increase in this property typicallyaccompanied some loss of foam resiliency. Figure 25shows the tan dversus tem-
perature plots from this study [ 164].
A similar foaming study was performed on epoxidized/hydroxylated soybean oil
polyols supplied from a different source [ 167]. A study sponsored by the United
Soybean Board investigated the performance of ESO that had been hydroxylated by
the opening of the epoxide with acetic acid. The authors concluded that the intensityof the peak tan din ﬂexible slabstock grade foams is diminished and that the T
g
of the resulting polymers is systematically increased as the content of soy-based
polyol is increased. The broadening of the tan dpeak to higher temperatures was
thought to reﬂect a greater degree of phase mixing (hard and soft domains) as theamount of soy polyol is increased, a proposal that was consistent with SAXS resultsof that study. The effect was seen to be more pronounced in the ESO polyols with
higher hydroxyl content. The test results were also affected by the cellular mor-
phology of the foams, which changed slightly to more anisotropic cell dimensionsas the amount of renewable content was increased. These changes are to beexpected as the hydroxyl content of the polyol is changed. Some of the macroscalecellular morphology differences may be addressed by adjusting the catalyst andsurfactants in the foam formulation, but this approach does not address fundamentaldifferences in mesoscale morphology and properties such as T
gand tan d.

One area of building and construction materials into which ﬂexible foam with
renewable content has been introduced through polyurethane chemistry is in carpetfor ﬂooring. The US federal government is the single largest purchaser of commer-
cial-grade indoor carpet. Federal regulations established by the Department of
Agriculture require that certain federal procurements be subject to a mandatedrequirement to meet a speciﬁcation for biorenewable content [ 168]. Round 3 of
the procurement rules designated carpet as a construction material to be subject torequirement for a minimum renewable content, which was speciﬁed at 7% mini-mum. This federal procurement requirement for biorenewable content has createda mandate for materials, which can be addressed with polyurethanes based onbiorenewable polyols.
Two different technologies already exist for the inclusion of renewable polyure-
thane foam into carpet. The most common part of the carpet installation that isprepared from polyurethane is the foam padding underneath the carpet, between thecarpet and the ﬂoor of the building. This foam is either prepared as a coating bondedto the carpet backing (common for commercial grade carpet), or the carpet underlayis prepared separately as “rebond” foam pad. Rebond foam for carpet padding istypically used in residential carpet installation, and is prepared from scrap andrecovered or recycled waste foam. Since the full measure of recycled foam is
currently conventional petrochemical-based polyurethane, a signiﬁcant market
entry for biorenewable foam will be required before the levels in scrap foamreach the threshold of 7% renewable content. However, the demand for carpetpad from rebond foam exceeds the supply of scrap and recycle, even when recycledfoam is imported, so virgin production foam is sometimes produced for the purposeof converting to rebond foam for carpet padding. This is one option for theintroduction of biorenewable foam into construction materials.
When added to the opportunities that are now being created through tax
incentives for environmentally responsible commercial and residential construc-
tion, ﬂexible foams in housing and construction applications appear to be headedfor future growth.
7.1.2 High Resiliency Foams
Of all the applications for polyols from renewable resources, the use of high
concentrations of renewable polyols based on triglycerides in ﬂexible moldedand high resilience slabstock foams is perhaps the most challenging. These typesof foams, which are used in automotive seating and premium bedding products, aredistinguished by high resiliency as deﬁned by the ball rebound resiliency test [ 169].
The product performance requirements for high resiliency foam are very stringent,
and the polymer morphology required to deliver that performance is relatively moredifﬁcult to obtain through polymer processing. The polymer morphology requires ahigh weight fraction of polyol with a high HEW. The resulting low hard segmentcontent (urethane/urea) means that the phase segregation of the hard domain is latein the cure proﬁle of the polymer, and the molecular weight and viscosity of the350 D.A. Babb
polymer foam is much higher at the phase transition than it is in conventional
ﬂexible foams. As a result, the foam cell opening, which is triggered by phasesegregation of the hard domain [ 170–173], is difﬁcult to achieve in high resiliency
foams. The rigidity of the phase segregated, co-continuous hard segment is mini-
mally present in these foams to stabilize the cell structure after cell opening, sophase segregation and cell opening are delayed until very late in the polymer cure.The close proximity of this phase segregation to the gel point of the polymer meansthat the processing latitude (the robustness of the foam processing conditions toslight variations) is small. Small changes in processing conditions can lead to foamcollapse due to incomplete gellation, or foam shrinkage due to a high percentage ofclosed cells from over-gellation. Preparation of high resiliency foams requires
relatively uniform polyols with high molecular weight, and low T
gpolyol segments
between hard segment linkages. Polyol structures such as low molecular weightpolyols, or short side-chain polyol branches that participate in the network connec-tivity, are generally not well tolerated in high resiliency foams.
Inherent to the property of high foam resiliency is a low tan dat the test tem-
perature [ 174,175]. The low T
gof polyethers is therefore preferred over the higher
Tgof polyester polyols [ 176]. High content of seed oil polyols tends to mimic the
addition of polyester polyol to formulations, increasing Tgand dampening resil-
iency and elasticity with increasing weight fraction of triglyceride polyols.
An attractive solution to this technology gap currently is just out of reach. The
use of castor or Lesquerella oils [ 177] as an initiator for high molecular weight
polyols has previously proven an effective strategy for the preparation of ﬂexiblefoams. As previously mentioned, alkoxylation of these starters is not possible withconventional acid or base catalysts, but instead requires a coordination catalystsuch as the zinc hexacyanocobaltate catalyst. Unfortunately, at this time, the DMCcatalyst has not been demonstrated to directly produce the high primary –OH
functionality required in polyols for high resiliency foams [ 178] through the
efﬁcient end-capping of the high molecular weight polyols with ethylene oxide[179]. In addition, under typical reactor conditions, the DMC catalyst produces a
trace of a very high molecular weight polypropylene oxide (4 /C210
5–1/C2106Da),
which is a very efﬁcient de-foamer and causes foam collapse, particularly for highresiliency foams. For these reasons, the DMC catalyst is not a straightforwardsolution to the preparation of polyols for high resiliency ﬂexible foam applications.The extension of triglyceride-initiated polyols for high resiliency slabstock and
molded foams awaits further enabling catalyst development.
In 2008, Dow Chemical reported an advance in the preparation of molded foams
using the ﬂexibility of the Renuva technology [ 145]. Polyurethane molded foams
prepared from the Generation 1 conventional foam polyols were compared to aGeneration 2 foam more speciﬁcally designed for high resiliency foam applica-tions. For a compromise of only 4% in renewable carbon content, improvements inalmost all categories of performance were demonstrated in both TDI high resiliencyand MDI high resiliency foams. Substantial improvements to resiliency and foam
compression set were achieved with no compromise in important mechanical pro-
perties. Foams were produced of 10–14% renewable content with fully acceptablePolyurethanes from Renewable Resources 351
performance features as compared to conventional molded high resiliency foam
products. Tables 3and4present the foam testing data from the Generation 1 and
Generation 2 products of these high resiliency foam polyols.
One of the more advertized advances in co mmercial offering of polyurethanes
from renewable resources was the introdu ction of soy-based polyol in the 2008
Ford Mustang [ 180,181]. Ford partnered with Lear Corp. to produce automotive
seats containing up to 40% soy-based pol yol. This was hailed as a throw-back to
the early days of Ford Motor Company, when Henry Ford incorporated as muchas 60 pounds of soybeans into paint co mponents and molded body parts for the
Model T.Table 4 Comparison of MDI foams (95 index): a standard formulation, and Generations 1 and

7.2 Rigid Foam
Rigid foams are distinguished from ﬂexible foams in several aspects. The ﬁrst and
most noticeable difference is that rigid foams are hard and inﬂexible. On themacroscale they are characterized by a very high content of closed foam cells(cell windows are intact). The best quality rigid foams have very small average cellsize. The principle application for rigid polyurethane foam is for thermal insulation.This property makes rigid polyurethane foams useful in refrigerators, water heaters,and other domestic appliances, and as pre-fabricated insulation board for interior
walls and rooﬁng in building construction. Rapid-cure rigid polyurethane foams
have been developed for spray-foam applications, where the foam is sprayed from acommercial dispensing unit onto a surface such as commercial or residentialrooﬁng. Most rigid foams are applied as a reactive mixture to the substrate or intothe container in which they will permanently reside, although a small percentage ofrigid foam is prepared in free-rise blocks and is then cut to shape. Most uses forrigid foam are in the manufacturing of appliances or in the thermal insulation ofresidential housing and commercial building construction.
The use of renewable resources in the construction industry is promoted in many
countries by legislation that encourages or requires the use of renewable content inconstruction materials in some sectors of the construction industry. Polyurethanespray foams that are prepared with renewable resources are gaining popularity withthe early adopters of legislative promotions in the commercial and residentialconstruction industries. Recent work has demonstrated the relative viability ofsome grades of closed-cell rigid foams for insulation, based on ESO chemistry[182]. These foams are beginning to make inroads into commercial and domestic
thermal spray-in insulation [ 183,184]. These polyurethane rigid insulation foams
have gained increasing attention in the building and construction industry due totheir contribution to the accumulation of LEEDS (Leadership in Energy andEnvironmental Design) points [ 185] or improvements to the Home Energy Rating
System Index [ 186], which enable qualiﬁcation for property tax credits through US
federal, state and local governments [ 187–189]. Builders who incorporate high
levels of renewable resources in building materials often beneﬁt directly throughproperty tax incentives provided by these green building certiﬁcation processes.
Some claims appear in the patent literature relating to the thermal and ﬂamma-
bility performance of polyurethanes created from ESO polyols [ 190], but such
claims should be carefully evaluated under the conditions of local, state or federalﬂammability testing methods, or of regional construction regulations.
8 Conclusions
Polyurethanes prepared via the use of renewable carbon sources are a relativelyrecent introduction to the commercial market. The opportunity is driven primarilyby the high and volatile cost of petroleum, and by societal concerns over thePolyurethanes from Renewable Resources 353
consumption of non-renewable resources. The nature of polyurethane chemistry
has dictated that the best ﬁt for the incorporation of renewable resources is in thepolyol component of the polymers. The only sources of renewable carbon that are
produced in the volumes that can readily address commercial demands for raw
materials are triglyceride oils from commodity annual plant sources. Differentchemical technologies for the production of these polyols are evolving alongindependent lines of development, with the objective of attaining establishedpositions based on meeting the cost and performance requirements of the market-place. Technologies range from simple thermal oxidation processes to integratedchemical manufacturing schemes. Products that address potential applicationsin ﬂexible slabstock and molded foams for bedding, furniture, and automotive
interiors; ﬂexible foams and elastomers for carpet backing; and rigid foams for
housing and construction are beginning to establish regular appearances in com-mercial forums.
The quality demands for product performance constitute a signiﬁcant hurdle
to market adoption of these new raw materials. The market has so far demon-strated that interest in adoption of cost-effective products with renewable contentis sustainable as long as product performance is not compromised. The differentchemistries that have been harnessed to pursue this opportunity are still in an
evolutionary stage, as polyol producers respond to market pressures for the high
quality and low price that has previously fuelled the success of the petrochemicalprogenitors. Time will tell which, if any, of the approaches to replacement ofpetroleum with renewable hydrocarbons will sustain a market presence, and willsucceed at impacting the consumption of global petrochemical stocks.
For current information on the commercial uses of triglyceride oils, readers are
directed to follow the periodic communications from the New Uses Committee ofthe United Soybean Board [ 191], which is staffed with informative professionals
who remain current in the alternative applications of soybean oil, and who support
the efforts of industry to develop alternative sources of feedstocks to reducedependence on petroleum.
