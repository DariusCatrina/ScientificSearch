‡These authors have contributed
equally to this work.InAspergillus fumigatus like in other ﬁlamentous ascomycetes, β-1,3-glucan constitutes a
prominent cell wall component being responsible for rigidity of the cell wall structure.
In ﬁlamentous fungi, softening of the cell wall is absolutely required during conidialgermination and hyphal branching. Because of the central structure of β-1,3-glucans, it
is expected that β-1,3-glucanases play a major role in cell wall softening. Based on in silico
and experimental data, this review gives an overview of β-1,3-glucan modifying enzymes
inA. fumigatus genome and their putative role during morphogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
The cell wall of Aspergillus fumigatus is predominantly composed
of polysaccharides. The central ﬁbrillar core of the cell wall is
composed of a polymer of β-1,3-glucan which is a branched glu-
can with 4% β-1,6 branch points, to which the chitin, the galac-
tomannan and β-1,3-1,4-glucan are covalently bound ( Fontaine
et al., 2000 ). All these polysaccharides are speciﬁc of fungal cells,
and constitute good antifungal target.
β-1,3-glucans of A. fumigatus are synthesized by a plasma
membrane-bound glucan synthase complex, which uses UDP-g l u c o s ea sas u b s t r a t ea n de x t r u d e sl i n e a r β-1,3-glucan chains
through the membrane into the periplasmic space (Beauvais et al.,1993, 2001). Upon arrival in the cell wall space, newly synthe-
sized polysaccharides are remodeled in order to be incorporated
in the pre-existing cell wall. An example of the modiﬁcations
that occur is given in Figure 1. Steps involved in the remodeling
process are structural modiﬁcations of the linear glucan chains,produced by the glucan synthase complex, followed by branch-
ing, elongation, and degradation of the β-1,3-glucan of the cell
wall. Morphogenetic events like conidial swelling (the isodiame-tral growth phase of germination) germ tube emergence and the
production of lateral hypha during mycelial growth require that
the cell wall loses its rigidity to allow the emergence of an “addi-
tional cell.” Two different biochemical events have been suggested
to be associated with germination: the ﬁrst one is an increased
intracellular osmotic pressure ( D’Enfert, 1997)a n dt h es e c o n d
one is the softening of the existing cell wall by glycosylhydrolases.
Osmotic pressure is high in resting conidia due to their high
content of trehalose and polyol. The molecules are, however, fullydegraded during the swelling of the conidium which suggests theoccurrence of another biochemical structural modiﬁcation event
to facilitate the remodeling of the cell wall during germination.
Glycosylhydrolases are the candidates of choice for these cell wall
modiﬁcations.
Here we present a survey of potential endo- β-1,3-glucanases
and exo- β-1,3-glucanases found in the A. fumigatus genome
as well as the already identiﬁed glucanases and glucanosyl-transferase activities described in A. fumigatus (Ta b l e 1 ). A
survey of β-1,3-glucanases was undertaken in the genomes of
A. fumigatus strain Af293 ( Nierman et al., 2005 )u s i n gt h e
cadre genome ( http://www.cadre-genom es.org.uk/Aspergillus_
fumigatus ) and the Carbohydrate-Active enZYme (CAZy)
Database ( http://www .cazy.org/).
AREβ–GLUCANASE INVOLVED IN THE CELL WALL
MODIFICATION?
β-1,3-Glucan hydrolyzing enzymes can be divided into exo- β-
1,3-glucanases and endo- β-1,3-glucanases. Endo-β -1,3-glucanase
activities cleave inside a glucan chain in a more or less randomfashion, while the exo- β-1,3-glucanase activities release glucose
residues from the non-reducing end ( Figure 1). Theoretically, the
cleavage of long chains of β-1,3-glucan should cause a softening
of the cell wall. Therefore, we expect this type of enzyme to be
involved in cell wall remodeling that occur during the swelling
and germination of conidia or the branching of hyphae.
In order to identify all the putative β-1,3-glucanases in
the A. fumigatus genome sequenced strain Af293 ( Nierman
et al., 2005 ), we used the classiﬁcation of the Carbohydrates
enZYmes database [CAZy database ( http://www .cazy.org/)]. This
database describes the families of enzymes with structurally

related catalytic and carbohydrate binding modules (CBM) that
degrade, modify or create glycosidic bonds. In this classiﬁca-
tion, we selected and further investigated the families which
could contain putative β-1,3-glucanases and each potential
endo/exo β-1,3-glucanase identiﬁed in the A. fumigatus genome
was used as a query for BLAST searches to identify possi-
ble homologs using cadre genome ( http://www.cadre-genomes.
org.uk/Aspergillus_fumigatus ). This search has led to the iden-
tiﬁcation of twenty nine potential exo- β-1,3-glucanases and
endo- β-1,3-glucanases that belong to the CAZy GH families
3, 5, 16, 55, and 81 ( Ta b l e 1 ). The expression of these dif-
ferent genes in mycelial growth either in liquid or aerial con-
ditions ( Gibbons et al., 2012 ) has been shown in Ta b l e 1 .
The molecular characteristics and the phylogenetic tree of
each of the proteins belonging to these families have been
investigated.
EXO- β-1,3-GLUCANASE FAMILIES
In the CAZy database, family GH5 represent a group of hydro-
lases with different substrate speciﬁcities such as for example exo
β-1,3-glucanases, endo β-1,4-glucanases, endo β-1,6-glucanases.
Four proteins belonging to GH5 family in A. fumigatus have
been identiﬁed in the genome (AfExg1p =AFUA_1G03600,
AfExg2p =AFUA_6G09250, AfExg3p =AFUA_7G05610, and
AfExg4p =AFUA_2G09350). The characteristics of these proteins
are presented in Figure 2A and Ta b l e 1 .
AfExg1p and AfExg4p have a signal peptide in contrast to the
others AfExg2p and AfExg3p. The phylogenetic tree of GH5 pro-
teins is presented in Figure 2B . Recently the respective orthologs
inS. pombe have been described ( Duenas-Santero et al., 2010 ).
SpExg1p is secreted, SpExg2p is bound to the membrane via a
GPI anchor and SpExg3p is a cytoplasmic protein. Interestingly,
inS. cerevisiae andC. albicans ,i th a sb e e ns h o w nt h a tE x g 1 pa n dXog1p are able to degrade β-1,3-glucan ( Vazquez de Aldana et al.,
1991; Chambers et al., 1993 )a n dd i s p l a ye x o β-1,3-glucanase
activities but Suzuki et al. (2001) showed also that the recombi-
nant ScExg1p was able to cleave also β-1,6-glucan. SpExg1 and
SpExg3 are only acting on β-1,6-glucans, while no activity was
detected for SpExg2 ( Duenas-Santero et al., 2010 ). In S. cerevisiae ,
the third ortholog SSG1 has been shown to code for a sporu-
lation speciﬁc exo- β-1,3-glucanase activity ( San Segundo et al.,
1993 ). In S. cerevisiae , the deletion of SSG1 showed a signiﬁcant
delay in the appearance of mature asci ( San Segundo et al., 1993 ).
In contrast, no growth phenotype for the single exg1 and exg2
deletion strains of S. cerevisiae has been observed ( Larriba et al.,
1995 ). Moreover, the triple ssg1 exg1 exg2 mutants behave like the
simple ssg1 mutant. In S. pombe , the phenotype of the triple exg
mutants behave like the parental strain ( Duenas-Santero et al.,
2010 ). None of the EXG1–4 gene has been deleted or otherwise
characterized in A. fumigatus .
In the CAZy database, family GH55 includes exo- β-
1,3-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.58) and endo- β-1,3-glucanases
(EC 3.2.1.39). In A. fumigatus , six proteins belonging
to this family are present: AfExg5p =AFUA_6G11980,
AfExg6p =AFUA_6G13270, AfExg7p =AFUA_3G07520,
AfExg8p =AFUA_1G14450, AfExg9p =AFUA_2G00430,
AfExg10 =AFUA_4G03350, ( Ta b l e 1 ).
It has been shown that Af EXG6 encodes a 82 kDa exo β-1,3-
glucanase enzyme named ExoGI which hydrolyze exclusively a
β-1,3-glucan chain with a minimal substrate size of four glu-
cose residues ( Fontaine et al., 1997a ). The characteristics of
theA. fumigatus proteins are shown in Figure 2C and Ta b l e 1 .
AfExg6p, AfExg7p, AfExg8p and AfExg10p feature a signal pep-
tide, while AfExg5p and AfExg9p are intracellular proteins.
AfExg9p features an additional LT_GEWL (Lytic Transglycosylase
and Goose Egg White Lysozyme) domain. The exoglucanases

Hypocrea lixii Bgn13.1 ( De la Cruz et al., 1995 ).
AfExg5p to AfExg10p all feature two domains with similarity to
the pectate lyase 3 domain. GH55 exoglucanases are not found
in yeasts like S. cerevisiae ,C. albicans and S. pombe .T h ep r o -

Hypocrea lixii Bgn13.1 ( De la Cruz et al., 1995 ) were added to
the alignment of the GH55 family to construct a phylogenetic
tree ( Figure 2D ). It has been shown that C. carbonum Exg1p and
H. rufa LamA1p encode for speciﬁc exo- β-1,3-glucanases ( Nobe
et al., 2004 ) in contrast to Bgn1p, Bgn2p and Bgn13.1p which
encode for speciﬁc endo- β-1,3-glucanases ( De la Cruz et al., 1995;
Kim et al., 2002 ). To date, the biological function of the A. fumi-
gatus GH55 glycosyl-hydrolases is unknown since none of these
genes have been deleted yet.
ENDO- β-1,3-GLUCANASE FAMILIES
The speciﬁcity of the members of the family GH16 in the
CAZy database is quite wide since members of this GHfamily can act as xyloglucan xyloglucosyltransferases (EC
2.4.1.207), keratan-sulfate endo-1,4- β-galactosidases (EC
3.2.1.103), endo-1,3- β-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39), endo-1,3(4)-
β-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6); licheninase (EC 3.2.1.73), β-agarase
(EC 3.2.1.81), κ-carrageenase (EC 3.2.1.83), or xyloglu-
canase (EC 3.2.1.151). The GH16 superfamily has been
divided into nine sub-families based on a phylogenetic
analysis of conserved domains of members of this super-
family (cd00413; http://www .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/
cdd/cddsrv .cgi?uid =29534 ): GH16_lichenases (cd02175),
GH16_XETs (cd02176), GH16_kappa_carrageenases (cd02177),
GH16_beta_agarases (cd02178), GH16_beta_GRPs (cd02179),
GH16_laminarinases (cd02180), GH16_MLG1_glucanases
(mixed-linked glucanases, cd02181), GH16_laminarinase_like
proteins (cd02182), and GH16_GPI_glucanosyltransferases
(cd02183).
InA. fumigatus , seven members Af ENG2 to Af ENG8 are
present in the genome ( Ta b l e 1 ,Figure 3A ). While AfEng2p to
AfEng5p belong to the subfamily GH16_MLG1_glucanases, and
Frontiers in Microbiology | Fungi and Their Interactions April 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 81 |4
Mouyna et al. β-1,3-glucan modifying enzyme
AfEng6p and AfEng7p to the subfamily GH16_laminarinase_like
proteins, AfEng8p was not assigned to a GH16 subfamily. The
cluster of GH16_MLG1_glucanases from AfEng2p to AfEng5p
contains four proteins which all share the same catalytic region
but aside from that feature different protein domains. AfEng2p
and AfEng3p both exhibit an N-terminal signal peptide but only
AfEng2p, which is considerably larger than its three homologs,
holds a GPI signal sequence. AfEng4p and AfEng5p on the otherhand are not predicted to contain a signal peptide but both feature
a transmembrane helix, suggesting a localization at the plasma
membrane with the active domain pointing toward the cell wall.
So while these proteins vary in terms of protein domains all four
of them might still be localized close to the cell wall, either by
being secreted or by being bound to the plasma membrane by a
GPI anchor or a transmembrane domain.
It has been shown that Af ENG2 encode for a endo β-1,3-
glucanase protein ( Hartl et al., 2011 ) .T h e s ee n z y m ea c t so n
β-1,3-glucans and lichenan but no degradation were observed
with β(1–6)substrate. Eng2p preferentially acts on soluble poly-
mers like laminarin and shorter β-1,3- linked oligosaccharides
and have a slight transferase activity with substrates of low
degree of polymerization (DP4 and DP6). The eng2 mutant is
similar to the parental strain su ggesting that AfEng2p alone doesnot play a morphogenetic role ( Hartl et al., 2011 ). The two
GH16_laminarinase_like proteins AfEng6p and AfEng7p exhibit
the same protein length and almost identical molecular weights.
Both feature a signal peptide followed by the catalytic domain.
AfEng7p additionally features a C-terminal GPI signal sequence.
While the bacterial members of this sub-family often contain a
CBM such as CBM6 ( Hong et al., 2002 ) or CBM13 (ricin-type
β-trefoil) ( Asano et al., 2002; Ferrer, 2006; Shi et al., 2010 ), no
such CBMs were identiﬁed in AfEng 6pa n dA f E n g 7p.
Although AfEng8p could not be assigned to the licheni-
nase subfamily with high signiﬁcance, part of the GH16 con-
served domain of AfEng8p showed some strong homology to
GH16_lichenases ( Planas, 2000 ), which have been shown to be
essential for the degradation of extracellular lichenan in Bacillus
subtilis (Wolf et al., 1995 ). The fact that AfEng8p also features a
signal peptide suggests a similar role in A. fumigatus .
In the GH16 family, three clades were identiﬁed
(Figure 3B ): the predicted GH16_MLG1_glucanases (top),
GH16_laminarinase_like proteins (middle), and the probable
lichenases (bottom). S. pombe is the only yeast that possesses
a GH16 glucanase (NP_595680). In the ﬁlamentous fungi the
number of GH16 glucanases ranges from one in M. grisea
(AAX07660) to eight in A. fumigatus . When looking at fungi

Mouyna et al. β-1,3-glucan modifying enzyme
f r o mt h es a m eg e n u s( A. fumigatus ,A. nidulans ,a n d A.niger ), the
total number as well as the number of enzymes present in each
clade varies. Because of their endoglucanase activity, multiple
deletion of the enggene is ongoing using the beta six rec cassette
allowing repetitive round of gene deletion after excision of the
resistance marker ( Hartmann et al., 2010 ).
Only endo- β-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39) belong to the GH81
family . A single member of this family has been found in the
A. fumigatus genome. It is a glycosylated 74 kDa endo- β-1,3-
glucanases protein that was isolated from A. fumigatus autolysate
(supernatant of the broken mycelium grown 3 days at 37◦C)
(Fontaine et al., 1997b ). This enzyme represents 10–15% of
the total β-1,3-glucanase activity found in the A. fumigatus cell
wall autolysate (supernatant of the cell wall extract incubated
3d a y sa t3 7◦C). The enzyme recognized at least ﬁve glucose
units linked by a β-1,3-bond. The gene encoding this activity
has been cloned and named ENGL1 (AFUA_1G04260) ( Mouyna
et al., 2002 ). AfEngl1p has an N-terminal signal peptide and a
large GH81 domain responsible for the endo-1,3-glucanase activ-
ity ( Figure 3C ). In contrast to A. fumigatus , two orthologs are
present in the S. serevisiaie ,S. pombe ,a n d C. albicans genome. The
phylogenetic tree of this GH81 family is presented in Figure 3D .
Like for AfEngl1p, it has been shown that SpEng1p, SpEng2p
(Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2008a )a sw e l la sS c E n g 1 p( Baladron
et al., 2002 ) exclusively hydrolyze linear β-1,3-glucan chains and
display the same enzymatic activity as AfEngl1p. Moreover the
four conserved aspartic and glutamic acid residues necessary for
enzymatic activity has been determined by site-directed mutage-
nesis in ScEng2p corresponding to D518, D588, E609, and E613(Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2008a ).
InS. pombe ,Martin-Cuadrado et al. (2003) showed that
SpEng1p encodes protein with detectable endo β-1,3-glucanase
activity whose deletion interfere in cell separation, because cells
fails to degrade the primary septum that separates the two sis-
ters cells. SpEng1p localizes to the septum region at the time
of cell separation. SpEng2p also exhibits endo- β-1,3- glucanase
activity but mutant /Delta1eng2 do not have a cell separation defect.
/Delta1eng2 ofS. pombe on the other hand is involved in ascus wall
degradation after sporulation ( Encinar del Dedo et al., 2009 ).
Esteban et al. (2005) showed in C. albicans that CaEng1p is also
involved in cell separation. Similar results has been obtained in
S. cerevisiae (Baladron et al., 2002 )w h e r e eng1 deletion mutants
show defects in cell separation. In contrast, the lack of phenotype
for the /Delta1engl1 mutant suggests that this endo- β-1,3-glucanase
activity does not play a morphogenetic role in A. fumigatus .
It has been shown that SpEng1p features a C-terminal CBM
consisting of three repeats of about 50 amino acids each ( Martin-
Cuadrado et al., 2008b ). The deletion of this CBM termed
SpEng1CBM caused a reduction of catalytic activity against insol-
uble substrates and a defect in targeting of Eng1p to the septum.No such CBM module has been found in other proteins of the
GH81 family in A. fumigatus
,S. cerevisiae ,o rC. albicans .
OTHERS EXO- β-GLUCANASES
In the CAZy database, family GH3 contains exo-hydrolases
able to degrade different substrates. They are classiﬁed
asβ-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21); xylan 1,4- β-xylosidase(EC 3.2.1.37); β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52); glu-
can 1,3- β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.58); glucan 1,4- β-glucosidase
(EC 3.2.1.74); exo-1,3-1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.-); α-L-
arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55). Ten members of GH3 are
present in the genome of A. fumigatus (Ta b l e 1 ): AFUA_1G05770,

AFUA_6G08700 and AFUA_6G03570. The characteristics of theproteins encoded by these genes are summarized in Figure 4A
and Ta b l e 1 . Half of the proteins are secreted. All the proteins of
A. fumigatus share conserved amino acids residues correspond-
ing to the GH3 domain of the protein. Eight proteins have a
Fibronectin like domain3 at the N-terminus. Fibronectin (FN) is
a multidomain protein with the ability to bind simultaneously
to cell surface receptors, collagen, proteoglycans, and other FN
molecules ( Schwarzbauer and De Simone, 2011 ). The phylo-
genetic tree is described in Figure 4B .T w om a i ng r o u p sa r e
observed. For most of the ﬁlamentous fungus, we observed a
high redundancy of gene (from 5 to 11) in contrast to C. albicans
(2) and S. pombe (only one). No orthologs have been found in
theS. cerevisiae genome. To date, the only enzymatic activity
characterized for this family in yeast or ﬁlamentous fungus
correspond to ExoGII encoded by AFUA_1G05770 of A. fumi-
gatus (Fontaine et al., 1997a ). ExoGII has been isolated from
the cell wall autolysate and is a 230 kDa protein able to degrade
β-1,3-glucan as well as β-1,6-glucan and p-nitrophenyl-glucose
(pNP-Glc). Such hydrolytic activity is in agreement with the
classiﬁcation of this enzyme in the GH3 family.
WHAT MORPHOGENETIC ROLE PLAYS THE
β(1,3)-GLUCANOSYLTRANSFERASE?
For many years, glucanosyltransferases were classiﬁed as glycosyl-
hydrolases because their transglycosidase function was unknown.
These glucanosyltransferases have indeed a glucanase activity
because the ﬁrst step in their sequential activity is to cleave lin-
earβ-1,3-glucans before the structural modiﬁcation of the glucan
(branching or elongation) in the second step. Because of their
action on already established β-1,3-glucans, these enzymes could
play a role in the structural modiﬁcation of the cell wall and favor
the emergence of a germ tube or an accessory hypha. Such roles
have been suggested but never demonstrated.
BRANCHING ENZYME
A glucanosyltransferase activity encoded by the BGT1 gene
has been identiﬁed biochemically in the A. fumigatus cell wall
autolysate, Bgt1p belongs to the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme
(CAZy) database Glycosyl hydrolase GH17 ( http://www .cazy.
org/)(Ta b l e 1 ). Bgt1p cleaves a laminaribiose from the reduc-
ing end of linear β-(1,3)-glucans and transfers the remaining
glucan to the end of another β-1,3-glucan acceptor with a β-(1,6)-
linkage ( Mouyna et al., 1998 ). Such activity had been described
originally in S. cerevisiae (Klebl and Tanner, 1989 ). We recently
characterized Bgt2p in A. fumigatus . This protein presents homol-
ogy with Bgt1p ( Gastebois et al., 2010a ). Using a recombinant
protein produced in P. pastor is , we showed that the enzymatic
activity of Bgt2p is a new branching activity, able to cleave two
residues of a β-1,3-glucan chain and transfer them to the inside

of another chain of β-1,3-glucan with β-1,6-linkage. However, the
single and double bgt1/bgt2 mutants do not display a phenotype
distinct from the parental strain ( Mouyna et al., 1998; Gastebois
et al., 2010a ). Moreover, the amount of the β-1,3-glucan branch-
ing point has not changed in these mutants in comparison
to the parental strain. Three other orthologs (AFUA_6G12380,
AFUA_8G05610 and AFUA_5G08780) belonging to the GH17
family are currently investigated for their role as branching
enzymes in the A. fumigatus cell wall.
ELONGATION ENZYME
Elongation of β-1,3-glucan is performed through the action of a
β-1,3-glucanosyltransferase, which were originally discovered in
A. fumigatus . This enzyme Gel1p splits a β-1,3-glucan molecule
internally and transfers the newly generated reducing end to the
non-reducing end of another β-1,3-glucan molecule, resulting in
the elongation of the glucan chain ( Hartland et al., 1996 ). Gel1p
belongs to a family of seven members speciﬁcally recognized
as the unique GH72 family in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme
(CAZy) database ( http://www .cazy.org/)(Mouyna et al., 2000a )
(Ta b l e 1 ). This enzyme activity has been conﬁrmed among par-
alogs of Gelp in A. fumigatus (Mouyna et al., 2000b; Gastebois
et al., 2010b ) and orthologs in other species like the GAS family
inS. cerevisiae (Vai et al., 1991; Ragni et al., 2007 ), the GAS fam-
ily in S.pombe (De Medina-Redondo et al., 2008, 2010 )a n d PHRfamily in C. albicans (Saporito-Irwin et al., 1995; Muhlschlegel
and Fonzi, 1997 ).
This GH72 family is subdivided in two families corresponding

cosylated and attached to the plasma membrane through a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The recent crystalliza-
tion of Gas2p, a Gelp homolog in S. cerevisiae , allows a better
understanding of the enzyme’s activity ( Hurtado-Guerrero et al.,
2009 ). Gas2p is composed of two interacting domains, a β(α)8
catalytic domain and a cystein-rich domain of the CBM43 fam-
ily. The catalytic domain contains three disulﬁde bridges that are
involved in the formation of the acceptor-saccharide binding site.

Glu275, and three tyrosine residues, Tyr107, Tyr244 and Tyr307,
all conserved in the GH72 family. Moreover, although that seven
homologs are present in the A. fumigatus genome, only GEL1 ,
GEL2, and GEL4 are expressed at each stage of growth in the
conditions tested ( Gastebois et al., 2010b ). Deletion of each gene
has a different effect on the phenotype. The gel1 mutant behaves
like the wild type, in contrast to the gel2 mutant which showed
reduced growth with several phenotypical changes and cell wall
modiﬁcation ( Mouyna et al., 2005 ). In addition, it was shown that
GEL4 is an essential gene ( Gastebois et al., 2010b ). The morpho-
genetic role of these transglycosidases does not seem, however,

CROSS-LINKING ENZYME?
The CRH family proteins which are classiﬁed in GH16 were
originally studied in S. cerevisiae and they have been sug-
gested biochemically to be involved in the linkage between
β-1,6-glucan and chitin ( Cabib et al., 2007, 2008 ). Although
there is no β-1,6-glucan in A. fumigatus cell wall, 5 CRH
orthologous genes have been identiﬁed in the A. fumigatus
genome, AFUA_6G03230, AFUA_2G03120, AFUA_3G09250,
AFUA_6G08510 AFUA_1G16190, and belonging to the
GH16_GPI_glucanosyltransferase subfamily ( Ta b l e 1 ). Their bio-
chemical function remains unknown in this fungus. In addition,
single deletion of these genes was not associated to any growth
phenotype modiﬁcation (Chabane S, Reichard U, unpublished).
Their role in morphogenesis will be only understood when the
quintuple crhmutant will be obtained.
CONCLUSIONS
Our understanding of the biochemical events responsible for
conidial germination or hyphal branching remains incomplete.
This review summarized the β-1,3-glucan modifying enzymes
which have been described and the putative β-glucanases iden-
tiﬁed in A. fumigatus genome. Although the role of glycosyl-
hydrolases during morphogene tic events has been suggested in
ﬁlamentous fungus for many years, there is still no real proof oftheir importance during cell wall softening. The corresponding
β-glucanases mutants obtained did not show any morphological
differences compared to the wild type. In addition, if modiﬁca-
tions of the glucanase activity have been seen in these mutants,
the quantiﬁcation of the activity is always performed in toto
and never takes into account the localization in situ and their
degrading capacity at a very speciﬁc cellular site. Such impor-
tance of the localization of the glycosylhydrolases has been alreadydemonstrated in S. pombe (Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2008b ).
The redundancy of the putative exo β-or endo-glucanase in the
genome (at least 29) make their analysis difﬁcult because of
putative compensatory mechanisms. The expression level of each
of these putative β-glucanase during germination by RNA seq
analysis is undergoing. Other hydrolases like chitinases that can
have also similar function as glucanases will be jointly investi-
gated. It should could give us some clue in the future to focus
and study the genes upregulated during these morphogenesis
events.
