Abstract
Thermal as well as microwave mediated free radical degradation of Guar gum in to lower molecular weight fragments was
studied. Swollen suspensions of guar ﬂour, containing either potassium persulphate or hydrogen peroxide, in aqueous isopropyl
alcohol were heated to eﬀect depolymerisation. From the intrinsic viscosity of the resulting products, molecular weight was
calculated using the Mark-Houwink equation. It was shown that both hydrogen peroxide and potassium persulphate degrade guargum in a concentration dependent manner and persulphate appeared to reduce molecular weight more eﬀectively than hydrogenperoxide. Microwave heating also promoted the degradation of guar gum and was much faster than conventional thermal reactions.
Thus prepared lower molecular weight guars are also shown to have better ﬁlm forming properties.

1. Introduction
Guar gum is a polygalactomannan obtained from the
seeds of a leguminaceae plant, Cyamopsis tetragonalobus ,
grown mainly in north western India and Pakistan. It is
a water soluble polysaccharide and because of its lowcost and excellent viscosifying properties, it and itsderivatives are extensively used in industrial applicationsincluding food [1], oil recovery [2], personal care [3], etc.
Structurally it has a back bone of b-1,4-linked mannose
units with a-1,6-linked galactose units attached as side
chains to almost every alternate mannose unit ( Fig. 1 ).
One of the main uses of guar gum is in food industry
where its bulking, stabilizing and water binding prop-erties are exploited [4]. It is also used in dietary
supplements as an indigestible sugar in obesity treat-ment. Another very important industrial use of guargum is as a hydraulic fracturing ﬂuid in oil and gasrecovery [5,6]. In these and other applications guar gumneeds to be degraded in a controlled manner in to lower
molecular weight fractions.
Depolymerisation of polysaccharides has been widely
studied [7]. Though acid [8]and enzymatic hydrolysis
[9,10] are most common, other methods such as g-
irradiation, extrusion [11,12] , ultrasonication [13]and
free radical degradation [14,15] are also reported. Acid
and enzymatic degradation of guar gum itself was in-vestigated [16]. In practice it is often diﬃcult to make large
quantities of depolymerised macromolecules with con-trolled degradation. In this study we report thermal andmicrowave mediated free radical degradation of guar
gum.
2. Experimental
Guar gum used was of commercial grade (S.D.
Finechem, Mumbai, India). Potassium persulphate(KPS), Hydrogen peroxide, methanol and isopropanol(all S.D. Finechem, Mumbai, India) were used asreceived. Peroxy content of hydrogen peroxide wasdetermined to be 55%.

2.1. Thermal degradation of guar gum
In a typical experiment 20 g of puriﬁed guar gum was
dispersed in 200 ml of isopropanol in a 500 ml roundbottomed ﬂask. While stirring the suspension witha magnetic bead, 40 ml of distilled water containingrequired amount of either potassium persulphate orhydrogen peroxide was added slowly. This freely stirringsuspension was heated to 100 (C and kept at that
temperature for diﬀerent times. The reaction mixture
was then allowed to cool to room temperature and
ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate was washed successively with 30%aq. Methanol, methanol and dried in an air-circulatingoven at 60 (C until constant weight.
2.2. Microwave degradation
A total of 100 g of guar gum was added to 200 ml
distilled water containing 1 g of potassium persulphateinitiator and kneaded well. It was then ground in akitchen mixer cum grinder in to a ﬂuﬀy, soft sponge like
material. Roughly 10 g of this material was then taken in
a cylindrical vial made of Teﬂon and subjected tomicrowave radiation in Ethos-1600 machine at 100 (C.
Power settings and time were the variables experimentedto control the degradation. The products were washedsuccessively with 30% methanol and methanol. Dried inan air-circulating oven at 60 (C until constant weight.
2.3. Molecular weight determination
Molecular weights of various depolymerised guar
gum compounds were determined from their intrinsicviscosity values and its relation to molecular weight via
Mark Houwink equation as reported earlier [17]. Brieﬂy,
using a Ubbelohde capillary viscometer the relativeviscosity ( h
r) was measured ( hryT/T0, where Tis the
solution ﬂow time and T0is solvent ﬂow time). From
this the speciﬁc viscosity was calculated ( hspZhr/C2551).
Intrinsic viscosity ( h) is normally determined by
measuring reduced viscosity hred(Zhsp/C) at various
concentrations in dilute solution and extrapolating
to concentration CZ0. The concentration depen-
dence is often expressed in terms of the followingrelationship.

where Kis known as Huggins constant. For ﬂexible
polymer molecules in good solvents Kis often near to
0.35, although somewhat higher values occur in poorsolvents. In the present work, a value of 0.35 wasadopted in the above equation to calculate intrinsicviscosity by measuring speciﬁc viscosity in dilutesolutions

2.4. Tensile strength
Tensile strength and elongation at break of native and
depolymerised guar gum, using 0.5, 1, 2, 3% KPS, were
studied from dried rectangular ﬁlms (0.08 mm !1c m!
5 cm) using Universal Testing Machine (Shimadzu,Japan, AGS-10 KNG).
3. Results and discussion
Guar gum is a high molecular weight seed gum. It
forms colloidal solutions, even in cold water, andimparts very high viscosities. Because of this and itswater binding capacity, it is used in such wide rangingapplications such as food, textile, medicine and oil
exploration. In certain applications where bulking is
needed it is necessary to depolymerise guar gum. Oneemerging area of application for polysaccharides is theiruse as solvent soluble polyols in coatings applications.For this purpose we needed a simple method to degradeguar gum in to smaller fragments so that they can befurther modiﬁed to achieve solvent solubility. Herein wepresent results of our work on free radical mediated
degradation of guar gum.O

3.1. Thermal degradation of guar gum
Guar gum was subjected to free radical degradation
using potassium persulfate and hydrogen peroxide. Theeﬀect of these reagents, their stoichiometry, time ofreaction on speciﬁc and intrinsic viscosity of guar gum ispresented in Table 1 . As can be seen, both the reagents
smoothly degraded guar gum in a concentration de-pendent manner. Potassium persulphate appeared todegrade guar better than hydrogen peroxide as evi-
denced by fall in h
sp. The extent of degradation
depended more on the concentration of the radical
generator rather than time. Viscosity average molecular
weight of diﬀerent guar macromers prepared wascalculated using Mark Houwink equation and resultsare plotted in Fig. 2 . As is evident it was possible to
prepare a wide M
vrange of guar gum using potassium
persulphate and hydrogen peroxide.
3.2. Microwave degradation
Microwave heating is the ﬁrst new heating technique
since the discovery of ﬁre [19]. This heating is based on
the ability of some materials to convert electromagneticenergy in to heat and it has revolutionised cooking andchemistry [20,21] . The main advantages of using micro-
waves for heating in chemistry are better yields, shorterreaction times, reduction of by-products and thermaldecomposition. In polymer chemistry several papersdescribing polycondensation [22], resin curing [23,24] ,
graft copolymerisation [25]have appeared. We investi-
gated the microwave heating for the free radical degra-dation of guar and the results are presented in Table 2 .
As can be seen, microwave heating also degraded
guar gum and it did so at a very rapid pace. Thus it wasTable 1

shown that guar gum can be degraded with free radical
generators like potassium persulphate and hydrogenperoxide in a concentration dependent manner by boththermal as well as microwave heating.
3.3. Tensile strength
Guar, because of it’s very high molecular weight,
forms colloidal solutions. Hence ﬁlms obtained from itssolutions are brittle [26]. For certain applications like
coatings it is desirable to have true solutions and better
ﬁlm forming properties. Tensile strength and elongationat break (%) EB of the ﬁlms prepared from aqueous
solutions of pure guar and depolymerised guar are showninTable 3 . It can be seen that degradation improved the
tensile strength as well as elongation at break values. Thusdepolymerised guar gum, with high water solubility, lowviscosity and better ﬁlm forming properties, should beuseful in surface coating formulations.
3.4. IR spectral analysis
To compare the chemical structural identities of guar
and degraded guar, we have recorded Infrared spectra.

As can be seen from Fig. 3 , the degraded guar has
a spectrum superimposable over that of native guar.This suggests that there are no major functional grouptransformations during this reaction and only randomfree radical chain scission might have taken place duringthese transformations.
3.5. Thermogravimetric analysis
Thermogravimetric analyses, in air, of native and
thermally degraded guar gum, using 1 and 2%
potassium persulphate, are depicted in Fig. 4 . The %
conversion vs. temperature curves of all these polymersare almost identical. This also suggests that there is nomajor change in chemical structure of these polymersand during free radical depolymerisation no crosslinkinghas taken place.
4. Conclusions
It was shown that guar gum can be degraded in to
lower molecular weight fragments using free radicalgenerators like potassium persulphate and hydrogenperoxide. Though both thermal energy and microwavescould eﬀect depolymerisation, the latter did so at a morerapid rate than the former.
