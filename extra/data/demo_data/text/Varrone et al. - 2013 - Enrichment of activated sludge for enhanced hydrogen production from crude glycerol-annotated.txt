Enriched activated sludge that can effectively convert crude glycerol into bio-hydrogen wasselected by an eco-biotechnological approach, in very strict conditions, using biodiesel-derived glycerol as the only carbon source. The thus obtained functional consortium was
characterized by the genera Klebsiella, Escherichia /Shigella and Cupriavidus. During enrich-
ment, the dominant metabolic end-product shifted from a 1,3 propanediol to ethanol, witha concomitant increase of the hydrogen yield from 0.18 /C60.003 to 0.66 /C60.06 mol/mol and
an almost ﬁve-fold increase of the hydrogen production. Glycerol degradation efﬁciencyshowed an increase of around 50%. In optimized and upscaled conditions it was possible to
obtain a hydrogen production rate of 2960 mL H
2/L/day /C6185 at a near stoichiometric yield
(of 0.90 mol/mol /C60.01), with a carbon recovery of almost 90%, both in sterile and non-
sterile conditions. Glycerol was almost totally degraded (degradation efﬁciency of
97.42% /C60.98), independently of the glycerol type used.

1. Introduction
Renewable resources, such as hydrogen, biodiesel or bio-
ethanol are gaining importance as an alternative pollution-free fuel for the future [1].F o re x a m p l e ,t h ec o n v e r s i o no f
lignocellulosic biomass to hydrogen or ethanol, or the use
of oil accumulating algae in the production of biodiesel is
being intensively investigated [2e5]. Industrial and living
wastes, such as paper mill- and municipal solid waste, toproduce hydrogen, have also been studied [6].T h e s eapproaches are very promising and might provide abundantnonfood feedstocks for the production of bioenergy andbiofuels, with environmental beneﬁts and large net energygains [5]. So far, the production of chemicals and fuels via
microbial fermentation has been largely based on the use ofsugars (i.e. glucose, lactose, xylose, etc.) as carbon source.
However, according to some authors this trend is likely to
change in the near future, due to the large surplus of glyc-erol generated as byproduct in the production of biodieselfuel [7,8].

The considerable growth of the biodiesel industry in the
last decade has created a glycerol glut that resulted in
a dramatic decrease in crude glycerol prices [5]. This decrease
in prices poses a problem for the glycerol-producing and-reﬁning industries, and the economic viability of the bio-diesel industry itself has been greatly affected [7e9].
Therefore, the development of processes to convert low-
priced glycerol into higher value products is expected to addvalue to the production of biodiesel and help the developmentof bioreﬁneries [1]. However, crude glycerol from biodiesel
production is usually contaminated with methanol, heavymetals, soap, oil and ashes from the process [10]. The chem-
ical puriﬁcation of these contaminants is becoming too costly(especially for small/medium-sized industries) and notfeasible any more [11]. Therefore, the use of anaerobic
fermentation, to directly convert abundant biodiesel-derivedglycerol (crude glycerol) into higher value products mightrepresent a promising route to achieve economic viability inthe biofuels industry [12].
Clearly, the success of these kinds of technologies greatly
depends on the use of suitable microorganisms [13]. Until now
there have been several studies of microbial processes toconvert glycerol, but still too little reports with crude glycerol,
which would really reduce the production costs [14]. Usually
the approach followed so far was to select and/or isolate
suitable bacteria on a synthetic medium, with pure glycerol,and subsequently test the ability to degrade also crude glyc-erol, thus generally leading to a decreased yield and conver-sion efﬁciency (probably due to the contaminants containedin the crude glycerol). Moreover, most studies focused on theuse of microbial pure strains as inoculum. The use of mixedmicrobial cultures for the conversion of a complex substrate(such as crude glycerol, containing several contaminants),would probably favor a higher efﬁciency, thanks to possible
beneﬁcial synergies. However, so far studies dealing with
mixed cultures for hydrogen production (through darkfermentation) have been rather scarce [15].
In this study we applied an eco-biotechnological approach to
select glycerol-fermenting bacteria, able to efﬁciently convertthe substrate into hydrogen. Eco-biotechnology aims atworking with processes employing mixed cultures andecological selection principles [16]. More precisely, the
approach relies on selection, cooperation and competition
mechanisms, rather than on genetic or metabolic engineering,with a clear advantage in terms of costs and environmentalsafety. In our approach, the starting point is to explore the
already existing biodiversity, obtaining the best candidates and
ﬁnally identifying optimal niche/conditions which can enhancethe performance of a particular metabolism/required process.
To our knowledge, the selection and acclimation of
a highly speciﬁc mixed culture directly on crude glycerol as
the only carbon source, without the use of any substratesupplementation, has not been investigated so far. Therefore,the main aim of this study was (1) to evaluate the possibility toselect a suitable microbial mixed culture directly on the targetsubstrate, by using a minimal medium without any nutrientsupplements, in order to reduce operational costs, (2) to
characterize the thus obtained microbial culture and (3)
evaluate its effectiveness to perform the desired fermentationprocess on different glycerol types.2. Material and methods
2.1. Culture medium
Minimal medium (MM) was used to dilute crude glycerol , which
was supplied by ItalBiOil srl., a biodiesel factory from southItaly, which contained up to 90% of glycerol, while the impu-rities were mainly composed of salts ( w7%), ashes ( w2%),
methanol ( w1%) and moisture (less than 0.4%). Comparison
tests were also performed (see Section 2.2.3 ), using pure glyc-
erol (reagent grade) and a different kind of crude glycerol ,
supplied by a biodiesel industry located in north Italy (DIINOVAOL), which contained around 84% glycerol, 0.35%methanol, 0.25% of TFM and less than 10% water, but no salts.
Unless differently stated, the minimal medium contained
per liter of distilled water: 20 g of glycerol, 3.4 g ofK
2HPO 4$3H2O, 1.3 g of KH 2PO4,2go f( N H 4)2SO4, 0.2 g of
MgSO 4$7H2O, 20 mg of CaCl 2$2H2O and 5 mg FeSO 4$7H20. The
use of a more complex medium was deliberately avoided,except for some speciﬁc experiments performed as compar-ison tests during the optimization step. Pre-boiled medium
was added into the serum bottles and sealed with butyl rubber
stoppers, prior to sterilization (15 min, at 121
/C14C), unless
otherwise stated. After cooling down, pre-activated culturewas inoculated (see the following paragraph) into the serumbottles. Subsequently the medium was ﬂushed with argon for3 min, using a hypodermic sterile syringe with a 0.22 mm ﬁlter,
before being incubated at 37
/C14C with continuous stirring
(120 rpm). Initial pH was 6.8 unless differently stated.
2.2. Experiments
2.2.1. Enrichment
During enrichment of activated sludge, the fermentation was
performed in 60 mL serum bottles in batch tests with 30 mLworking volume, under controlled temperature, initial pH andanaerobic condition. Sludge samples were collected fromHarbin wastewater treatment plant, Heilongjiang province,China. We considered the sludge as a potentially suitable seedinoculum for glycerol-fermenting bacteria since, underanaerobic conditions, the lipids contained in a municipal
treatment plant can be converted into glycerol [17]. In this
case we would expect that some of the microbial organisms
contained in the sludge would be able to exploit this resourceand that they might be selected. Enrichment was performedaccording to Barbirato et al. [18], with the aim to select a pool
of microorganisms suitable for crude glycerol digestion. The
idea was to use very strict conditions, with crude glycerol asthe only carbon source, without adding trace element- orvitamin solution, tryptone or yeast extract, in order to createvery selective conditions and to reduce operation costs [19].
Besides, it should also be underlined that, according to some
authors, yeast extract could affect hydrogen production
[3,20,21] , therefore its use should be evaluated case by cases,
in order to avoid misleading yields (i.e. higher than the theo-
retical one). Moreover, to enhance hydrogen production weshould try to reduce the 1,3 propanediol (1,3 PD) production,notably associated to low hydrogen production [22]. Since the
formation of 1,3 PD from glycerol is vitamin B12-dipendentinternational journal of hydrogen energy 38 (2013) 1319 e1331 1320
[23], the use of a very simply synthetic medium, without
additional nutrients and vitamins would probably favor the
oxidative pathway for enhanced hydrogen production.
Using the activated sludge as starting inoculum, repeated
transfers (5% v/v) of the best hydrogen-producing batches infresh liquid medium at short intervals (21 h) allowed theaccumulation of desired microbial strains, since bacteria notable to ferment glycerol would be outcompeted by the fastergrowing glycerol-consuming bacteria. The effect of trasferring5% (v/v) liquid inocula (also containing contaminants andfermentation products) rather than bacterial pellet (withoutthe liquid) was also evaluated. In the latter case, liquid
samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 rpm. Super-
natant was washed away and pellets resuspended into freshmedium.
The enrichment phase was performed for several months,
in order to verify how many transfers were necessary to
obtain a stable and reproducible fermentation. The procedurewas thus repeated in order to conﬁrm the possibility to ach-ieve the same results again, and we considered the enrich-ment phase concluded, once the same stable condition wasreached. The thus obtained enriched activity sludge was usedas inoculum in all the further tests. It was stored at /C018
/C14C and
refreshed monthly. For pre-activation, minimal medium was
supplemented with 1 g/L of peptone.
2.2.2. Optimization experiments
After enrichment, 125 mL serum bottles were used in order toevaluate the effect of important operation parameters andconditions, such as inoculum%, headspace/medium ratio (H/M ratio, v/v), addition of yeast extract, as well as vitamin andmineral solution. Vitamin solution was prepared by adding20.0 mg of biotin, 50.0 mg p-Aminobenzoic acid, 20.0 mg folicacid, 50.0 mg pantothenic acid calcium salt, 50.0 mg nicotinic
acid, 1.0 mg vitamin B12, 5.0 mg thiamine $HCl, 100.0 mg
pyridoxine hydrochloride, 50.0 mg thioctic acid and 5.0 mg
riboﬂavin to 500 mL of distilled water. 0.25 mL of this solutionwere then added to the serum bottles with 50 mL workingvolume. Wolfe’s Modiﬁed Mineral Elixir was preparedaccording to [24]. For 50 mL of medium, 0.25 mL of the mineral
elixir was used. No MgSO
4$7H2O, FeSO 4$7H2O and CaCl 2were
added to the minimal medium when using the mineral elixir.
2.2.3. Upscale tests
Experiments were conducted using a BioFlo/CelliGen 115Benchtop Fermentor & Bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientiﬁc,
Edison, NJ, USA) of 3 L, with 1 L working volume kept at 37
/C14C
with continuous agitation (120 rpm). Based on previous
results, initial pH was set at 8, using KOH 6 M solution, andwas not controlled during fermentation. Different glyceroltypes were tested (Itabiol, Novaol, pure glycerol and non-sterile Novaol) and diluted with the minimal medium, in orderto reach an initial concentration of about 15 g/L. Anaerobicconditions were obtained by initially sparging the mediumwith pure nitrogen for 10 min, at a ﬂow rate of 1 L/min. Thevessel of the fermentor was equipped with a condenser(working with ﬂowing water supply) in order to minimize
medium evaporation. The bioreactor was inoculated with
10% v/v pre-activated bacterial seed culture, grown in 125 mLserum bottles with 50 mL culture medium for 21 h, at the sametemperature. Unless for non-sterile Novaol experiments, the
bioreactor was sterilized before inoculation with seed culture.
2.3. Analytical methods
In all experiments, gas products have been sampled and
analyzed by GC with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD),while glycerol and liquid fermentation products have beenanalyzed by HPLC with UV detector and Refractive Index, aspreviously described [15]. Biogas production was determined
by water displacement (followed by GC analysis), while mass
balance equation was used to estimate hydrogen production
[25]. A modiﬁed Gompertz equation was used to model
cumulative hydrogen production [26] and to calculate
production rate [27]. Bacterial growth during enrichment was
estimated spectrophotometrically at 680 nm. Multivariatedata analysis was performed using Unscrambler X 10.1 softare(by Camo), while Excel’s patch “Solver” was used for themodiﬁed Gompertz equation.
2.4. Molecular characterization of the enriched activated
sludge
2.4.1. DNA extraction and PCR ampliﬁcation
Hundred mL of a fresh inoculum culture were used for DNA
extraction, using GeneMATRIX /C228Bacterial & Yeast Genomic
DNA Puriﬁcation Kit (EURx, Gdansk, Poland), according to themanufacturer’s instructions. Universal bacterial primers 27F(AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and 1389R (ACGGGCGGTGTGTACAAG) were used to amplify near full-length 16S rDNA.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using
Perpetual Taq PCR Master Mix (EURx) containing 1.5 mM
MgCl
2, 0.2 mM (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.1 mM
(each) primer, 1.25 U Perpetual Taq DNA Polymerase and 15 ngtemplate DNA in 50 ml reaction volume. The ampliﬁcation was
performed using the 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Bio-systems, Foster City, CA, USA) with a touchdown program,conducted as follows: 94
/C14C for 2 min followed by 28 cycles of
95/C14C for 40 s, 65/C14C for 40 s (the annealing temperature
decreased to 55/C14C by 0.5/C14C every cycle for the ﬁrst 20 cycles
and the remaining cycles at 55/C14C), 72/C14C for 90 s, and then the
ﬁnal extension at 72/C14C for 10 min. The ampliﬁcation products
of four single PCR reactions were pooled for reducing the biasintroduced with PCR.
2.4.2. 16S rDNA library construction and sequencing
Two ml of the mixed PCR products were used for cloning into
vector PCR/C2102.1-TOPO of the TOPO TA cloning/C210 kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instruc-tions. The clones were screened using Luria-Bertani (LB)medium agar plates containing 50 mg/ml kanamycin and
40 mg/ml X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- b-
D-galactopyr-
anoside). 102 white colonies were randomly picked up andregrown overnight in LB medium containing kanamycin for
subsequent analysis. Plasmid DNA was extracted by means of
GeneMATRIX Plasmid Miniprep DNA Puriﬁcation kit (EURx).The plasmids were screened for 16S rDNA insert by perform-ing PCR with the vector-located primers M13F (GTAAAACGACGGCCAG) and M13R (CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC). The PCRreaction mixture was prepared like previously mentioned.international journal of hydrogen energy 38 (2013) 1319 e1331 1321
Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95/C14C for 10 min,
followed by 25 cycles of 95/C14C for 40 s, 46/C14C for 40 s and 72/C14C
for 90 s. A ﬁnal extension step of 10 min at 72/C14C was applied.
The plasmid DNA of the selected clones was used to
sequence 16S rDNA insert, using speciﬁc primers 27F and
1389R. DNA sequencing was performed on the ABI 3730 DNAanalyzer by Genechron (C.R. ENEA Casaccia, Rome, Italy).
2.4.3. Phylogenetic analysis of clones
Raw sequences from both strands were aligned using ClustalX version 2.0 and alignments were edited and manually cor-rected by ChromasPro version 1.5 (Technelysium Pty Ltd). Allsequences were analyzed with the Mallard program (version
1.02) to detect the presence of possible chimeric artifacts. The
sequences were checked and classiﬁed by the basic localalignment search tool (BLAST; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST ) and the RDP-classiﬁer ( http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/
classiﬁer/classiﬁer.jsp ) of the Ribosomal Database project
(http://rdp.cme.msu.edu ). Phylogenetic analysis was con-
ducted using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysispackage, version 5 [28]. The closest 16S rDNA sequences ofreference microorganisms were retrieved from the GenBankand were aligned to DNA sequences from library, using the
Clustal W function. Phylogenetic tree was inferred, using the
neighbor-joining method [29]. Evolutionary distance matrices
were generated according to Kimura 2-parameter model [30].
Bootstrap re-sampling analysis with 1000 replicates was per-
formed to check the robustness of the tree. Tree topology wasconﬁrmed by comparing three phylogenetic reconstructionmethods: neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood andmaximum parsimony.
The newly identiﬁed 16S rDNA sequences were deposited
in the GenBank nucleotide sequence database, under acces-sion number JX310739-JX310754 and JX416353-JX416361.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Enrichment
Preliminary tests were performed to verify the possibility togrow activated sludge on crude glycerol as the only carbon
Fig. 1 eHydrogen content in the biogas (expressed as H 2%) detected during the ﬁrst enrichment phase. A clear inhibition
was observed already after the third transfer, and only the use of bacterial pellets (starting from T8) allowed to preventfurther inhibition and to carry on the enrichment process. Further transfers rapidly led to a stable hydrogen content in thebiogas (around 35%). With the exception of T6 all the transfers occurred after 21 h fermentation.

source and to produce hydrogen. Subsequently, a ﬁrst
enrichment was performed for several months, in order to
identify the maximum hydrogen production potential, and
the possibility to obtain a stable microbial community andprocess. In our study this was obtained once the biogascomposition reached a hydrogen content of around 35%, in21 h fermentation. After that, further transfers didn’tenhance the hydrogen production substantially ( Fig. 1 ). It is
worth noting that after an initial increase in hydrogenproduction, there was a clear inhibition of the fermentationprocess, probably due to accumulation of inhibitoryfermentation products ( Fig. 1 ). After six transfers (T6) there
was no hydrogen production at all within the 21 h, and even
after 42 h fermentation the detected hydrogen content in the
biogas only reached around 12%. A further transfer into freshmedium didn’t re-establish the previous conditions (T7).Therefore 5% v/v liquid inoculum was centrifuged (in order towash away the liquid phase, containing high concentrationsof soluble metabolites) and only the pellet was transferred in
T8. Following to this procedure, a consequent rapid increase
of H
2% was observed. Due to these ﬁndings, from that
moment on all the transfers were performed with pelletsonly.
The enrichment process was thus repeated in order to
evaluate the reproducibility and the minimum number oftransfers necessary to obtain a stable fermentation. In thisstep, main fermentation products and parameters weremonitored, in order to better characterize the process.
Data shown in Table 1 suggested that the enrichment
process was not linear, but displayed a rather irregular
pattern, with an initial rapid increase, followed by a decrease
of the main parameters involved. At the end of the process,however, there was a clear enhancement in the ability ofconverting glycerol into hydrogen.

Fig. 3 ePrincipal Component Analysis, showing the most important fermentation products and parameters monitored
during the enrichment. The score plot (left) shows the distribution of the 10 transfer experiments (scores). The loadings(right) show the main parameters inﬂuencing the distribution of the scores. Those laodings gathering together arepositively correlated to each other, while those which are opposite are negatively correlated. The Principal Components(PC1 and PC2) explain 79% of the total variability. The score plot seems to display three different steps/directions during the
enrichment: from transfer 1 to 3, then transfer 4 and 5, and ﬁnally from 6 to 10.international journal of hydrogen energy 38 (2013) 1319 e1331 1323
Interestingly, the concentration of 1,3 PD (1,3 propanediol)
followed an opposite trend compared to the ethanol concen-
tration ( Fig. 2 ), probably because the 1,3 propanediol pathway
is alternative to the ethanol/oxidative pathway. After step 10the fermentation process achieved around 35% of hydrogen(in 21 h) and the microbial mixed pool was transferred inlarger serum bottles (for optimization), in order to reduceinhibitory effects of increasing hydrogen partial pressure.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) conﬁrmed this irreg-
ular pattern ( Fig. 3 ), as can be observed in the score plot. PC1,
explaining 55% of the total variability, clearly showed thathydrogen (production and yield), glycerol consumption and
ethanol concentration were positively correlated and showedhigher values in step 3 and 10 of the enrichment (on the leftside of the score plot), while 1,3 PD and acetic acid were
negatively correlated with those parameters (loading plot),thus conﬁrming the trend already observed in Fig. 2 . This
means that, moving along the PC1 from right to left, we canobserve an increase of hydrogen production and yield(together with an increase of the glycerol conversion andethanol production) and a correspondent decrease of the 1,3PD and acetate production. The ﬁnding that 1,3 PD is associ-ated to lower hydrogen (and ethanol) production is in accor-dance with a previous study by Zeng and colleagues [22].
The fact that ethanol is correlated with hydrogen produc-
tion (and negatively correlated to acetate) probably dependson the effect of the hydrogen partial pressure in the reactor,which is known to greatly inﬂuence ethanol conversion rate.In fact, ethanol can accumulate only with high hydrogenpartial pressure. More precisely, when hydrogen partialpressure is below 10
4Pa, ethanol will be converted to acetic
acid [31]. In our study, hydrogen partial pressure during
enrichment usually reached values between 5 and 10$ 104Pa,
thus favoring ethanol accumulation.
3.2. Optimization experiments
Optimization of important fermentation parameters and
conditions, such as headspace/medium ratio (H/M ratio, v/v),inoculum (v/v), as well as the use (or not) of speciﬁc supple-ments and nutrients, further enhanced the hydrogen (andethanol) production, together with the glycerol conversionefﬁciency. As can be observed in Table 2 , the best results were
achieved with the use an H/M ratio of 1.5 (50 mL working
volume in 125 mL) and 10% v/v inoculum, without the need ofany substrate supplementation, thus reaching a hydrogenyield of around 0.82 mol/mol and a hydrogen content in thebiogas of 41%. Glycerol was almost completely degraded in allthe heasdspace/working volume experiments, but for H/Mvalues of 0.4 and 0.8 it took more than twice the time (data notshown). Addition of vitamin solution or yeast extract to theenriched activated sludge didn’t affect hydrogen yield signif-icantly, while the use of mineral solution showed an inhibi-tory effect on hydrogen production, regardless if used togetherTable 2 eOptimization experiments. The best condition
of H/M ratio (1.5) was used for the following experiments,
while the best condition obtained in the inoculum
experiments (10%) was then used in substrate
supplementation tests.

with other supplements or not. Therefore we can afﬁrm that
the enrichment process allowed to successfully selected forafunctional consortium (sensu Adav et al., [32]), which is able to
effectively convert crude glycerol (as the only carbon source)
into hydrogen, without any supplementation.
3.3. Scale-up tests
Scale-up tests using a 3 L bioreactor operated in optimizedconditions, with different glycerol types, did not showsigniﬁcant differences of the main fermentation parameters.The modiﬁed Gompertz equation was used to ﬁt cumulative
hydrogen production and calculate production rate. As can be
seen in Fig. 4 , the use of Novaol or Itabiol crude glycerol, as
well as non-sterile Novaol or pure glycerol, showed similarresults in terms of cumulative hydrogen production. In allcases the substrate was (almost) totally degraded, witha glycerol degradation efﬁciency, expressed as the percent ofthe initial concentration, of 97.42% /C60.98. At the end of the
fermentation the hydrogen content in the biogas reached onaverage 54.05% /C60.99.
The main parameters characterizing the modiﬁed Gompertz
equation are shown in Table 3 . Average (cumulative) hydrogenproduction potential ( P
max) reached 3652 mL H 2/C6199, with
a production rate (H 2Rate) of 2960 mL H 2/L/day /C6185 and a yield
of 0.90 mol/mol /C60.01. The high value of R2(>0.98) suggests that
the modiﬁed Gompertz equation was able to describe theevolution of hydrogen production satisfactorily.
The quantiﬁcation of fermentation products was also used
to perform fermentation balance analysis (as reported byMurarka et al., [33]), and is presented in Table 4 . The carbon
recovery of fermentation products represented almost 90%(88.12% /C61.93) of the consumed glycerol, thus indicating
a good closure of the carbon balance. In accordance withMurarka et al. [33], 1,2 propanediol was undetectable via HPLC,
possibly due to low concentration.
All the most important parameters describing the
fermentation process (such as hydrogen production and yield,substrate degradation efﬁciency and carbon recovery)conﬁrmed the ability of the selected enriched activated sludgeto effectively convert different glycerol types into hydrogen,both in sterile and non-sterile conditions, without the neces-sity to previously select the bacteria on a synthetic substratewith pure glycerol.
The main studies conducted so far and dealing with mixed
cultures grown on glycerol for hydrogen production (using
dark fermentation) are summarized in Table 5 for comparison.
3.4. Microbial community analysis
Bacterial diversity of the selected microbial mixed culture
(GCL) was investigated by cloning PCR-ampliﬁed (nearlycomplete) 16S rRNA genes. 90 clones, out of 102 totally iso-lated, produced useful sequences, showing high level ofsimilarity (sequence identity /C2199%) with 16S rDNA sequences
present in the NCBI database ( Table 6 ).
No chimeric sequences were found among the clones
analyzed. All sequences were phylogenetically allocated downto the order, family and genus level by the RDP ClassiﬁcationAlgorithm, with bootstrap values ranging from 95 to 100%(Table 7 ). GCL clones related to the dominant group ofTable 3 eModiﬁed Gompertz equation to describe the
cumulative hydrogen production in the batch tests.

Gammaproteobacteria (90% of the total number of clones) were
afﬁliated to sequences of Enterobacteriaceae family and were
identiﬁed at genus level as Klebsiella (57.78%), and Escherichia/
Shigella (32.22%) ( Table 7 ). The latter genus grouped together inEscherichia /Shigella , according to their genetic relationship,
since strains of Shigella have arisen through multiple inde-
pendent origins from within Escherichia coli, that is Shigella
strains are actually clones of E. coli [39].Table 5 eOverview of the main results of recent studies dealing with glycerol fermentation to hydrogen, using mixed

The genus Klebsiella contained more species ( Table 6 ) and
up to thirty-one sequences were afﬁliated to uncultured
relatives (59.61% of the total Klebsiella ). Among Klebsiella spp.,
eight clone sequences (15.38%) were identiﬁed as Klebsiella
pneumoniae and ten (19.23%) as K. ANctcri2 respectively. The
remaining sequences (1.73%/each) were afﬁliated to thespecies K. GBK1 ,K. A18-1 and K. VITPGP5AA . Even though each
of these sequences was represented by a unique GCL clone,they were still evaluated in the community composition,because the inferred assignment was robust (similarity: 99%and 100%) ( Table 6 ).
Clones belonging to the group Escherichia/Shigella were
afﬁliated to the species E. coli (79.31%) and Shigella sonnei
(18.76%).
The betaproteobacteria-related clones (10% of the total
number of clones) grouped into the unique Cupriavidus genus
(formerly Ralstonia ) within the Burkholderiaceae family. All
sequences were afﬁliated to Cupriavidus metallidurans .
The phylogenetic tree established with a bootstrap
neighbor-joining (NJ) method is shown in Fig. 5 . The GCL
clones fell into three clusters ( Klebsiella ,Escherichia/Shigella
and Cupriavidus ), each corresponding to the identiﬁed genera
in the microbial community. The phylogenetic relationship
between the dominant group ( gammaproteobacteria ) of GCL
clones closely related at genus level ( Klebsiella and Escherichia/
Shigella ) and the smaller and more distant group ( betaproteo-
bacteria ), produced an NJ tree characterized by very short
peripheral branches, while the longer external branches
indicated the higher phylogenetic distances between theobserved clusters.
Among all the identiﬁed microorganisms of the GCL
community, Klebsiella spp. and E. coli sp. are probably playing
the key role for hydrogen production. Previous studies showed
that different strains of K. pneumoniae [40,41] , and Klebsiella
oxytoca [42], are able to metabolize both, crude and pure
glycerol under anaerobic conditions, mainly producing 1,3
propanediol, ethanol and organic acids. Klebsiella sp. HE1 [43]
was able to produce hydrogen from pure glycerol, while K.
pneumoniae DSM 2006 and Blb01 were both used in optimiza-
tion studies for hydrogen production from biodiesel waste[44,45] . More studies are available for E. coli , attesting the
ability of different strains to anaerobically ferment glycerol,producing hydrogen and co-products [1,12,33,46] . In all these
studies, pure cultures of genetically and metabolically engi-neered
microbial strains were used for improving hydrogen or
ethanol production.
Within the GCL community, a different and maybe less
clear role has been played by S. sonnei and C. metallidurans .S.
sonnei is a well known human pathogen and its presence in
the community was not surprising, bearing in mind the originof the inoculum. This bacterium is able to ferment sugars
without gas production and Shigella ﬂexneri strain G3, closely
related to S. sonnei , was recently isolated and characterized as
cellulolytic bacterium in anaerobic condition [47].S. sonnei
represented only a minor fraction (6.67%) of the microbial
community and we may suppose that it was able to survive oncrude glycerol, without performing any useful role, in terms ofhydrogen production, in the microbial community.
C. metallidurans (formerly Ralstonia metallidurans ) was
previously found on industrial sites characterized by thepresence of industrial wastes, soils or sludges rich in toxicheavy metals, often mixed with organic recalcitrant
compounds and hydrocarbons [48]. Strain NBRC-101272, also
retrieved in the GCL community, was ﬁrst isolated from
drainage water of a chemical laboratory [49]. Therefore, C.
metallidurans strains are adapted to grow on metal contami-
nated environments and perform a strong resistance to
environmental stressors. Moreover, this interesting bacteriumis able to grow as a facultative hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium(acting as a sink for hydrogen), but it is also a methylotrophicbacterium, thus able to use C1 compounds such as methanolor methylamine (but not methane) as a carbon source for itsgrowth [50]. There are no reports associating this bacterium to
hydrogen production from glycerol. Therefore, its role in our
microbial community may be related to detoxiﬁcation func-tions. In fact, the methylotrophic ability of C. metallidurans
might be useful for methanol degradation. On the other hand,being a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium [48],i tm a y
consume hydrogen and fermentation products, assuming therole of antagonist inside the community.
In the present study, the use of 16S rDNA cloning technique
allowed to gain a deep insight in the community compositionand heterogeneity, including the fraction of ‘ uncultured ’
microbial populations.
The good performance in hydrogen production from crude
glycerol, obtained with this consortium, may be related to thecooperative metabolic activities between microorganisms,that produced an increased ﬂux of easily biodegradablesubstrates involved in hydrogen-generating pathways.
The structure of microbial community also pointed out an
intra- as well an inter-species diversity among GCL clones(Fig. 5 ). The coexistence of such polymorphic populations
(inter-species diversity) may be maintained by a so called
cross-feeding mechanism, in which a strain, specializing ona primary resource, coexists with other cross-feeding strains,that specialize on a waste product resulting from consump-
tion of the primary resource [51].
Clearly, mutualism such as syntrophic metabolic cooper-
ation may also be active in the degradation of crude glycerol
and its impurities. The main difference with the cross-feeding
Fig. 5 ePhylogenetic tree of species detected in GCL library, showing relationship of 16S rDNA sequences of isolated clones
(GCL-) to the most closely related sequences from the Genbank (numbers in brackets represent accession number of
sequences). The tree was developed using the neighbor-joining method with bootstrap consensus inferred from 1000
replicates. It is rooted using Methanosarcina mazei as an outgroup. Major phylogenetic groupings are indicated and
bracketed on the right. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the identical units as those of the evolutionarydistances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Kimura 2-parameter method was used to compute the evolutionary distancesand is in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The scale bar represents 0.05 substitutions per nucleotideposition.international journal of hydrogen energy 38 (2013) 1319 e1331 1328
mechanism is that syntrophic metabolic cooperation is
a strict relationship between two metabolically unrelated
species of bacteria (inter-species diversity), which depend oneach other for energetic reason and perform togethera fermentation process that neither can perform alone [52].
Sarma et al., [53]pointed out that the use of suitable co-culture
for impurities degradation (i.e. methanol and soap), that areknown to have inhibitory effect on microbial growth, may playa signiﬁcant role in improving hydrogen yield. Some species ofKlebsiella and Escherichia are known to have soap degradation
potential [54]. Moreover, C. metallidurans is probably contrib-
uting to a syntrophic metabolic cooperation, helping detoxi-
fying crude glycerol through methanol degradation, while
growing on the fermentation products (hydrogen and volatilefatty acids) of Klebsiella and Escherichia spp. Seemingly, intra-
and inter-species metabolic cooperation (syntrophism and/orcross-feeding) was activated in our consortium as a conse-quence of the selective pressure applied during the enrich-ment of activated sludge, namely the use of crude glycerol asthe only carbon source, without any supplementation of yeastextract, tryptone, nor vitamin- and mineral solution.
Clearly, successful biological hydrogen production
depends on the overall performance (results of interactions) of
the bacterial community (i.e. mixed cultures) in the reactor.
Therefore, selected mixed cultures may provide usefulcombinations of metabolic pathways for the processing ofcomplex waste material, thereby supporting a more efﬁcientdecomposition of biomass, compared with pure bacterialspecies [3,55] . Thus, the use of the enriched activated sludge,
thanks to the establishment of positive mechanisms ofmetabolic cooperation (syntrophism and/or cross-feeding),probably favored the high conversion efﬁciency of thedifferent glycerol types investigated.
4. Conclusions
In this study we applied enrichment of activated sludge toselect glycerol-fermenting bacteria, able to efﬁciently convertthe substrate into hydrogen. The microorganisms weredirectly selected and acclimatized on crude glycerol, withoutthe use of substrate supplementation, in order to reduce
operational costs. The enrichment displayed a non linear
pattern, which however led to a signiﬁcant improvement ofglycerol conversion into hydrogen, also related to the increasein ethanol concentration and concomitant decrease of 1,3 PD,as shown by the PCA. The thus obtained enriched activatedsludge was then used for further optimization of fermentationparameters, leading to a high hydrogen production rate(2960 mL H
2/L/d/C6185.5) and near stoichiometric yield
(0.90 mol/mol /C60.01), together with a (almost) complete
substrate degradation (97.42% /C60.98). At the end of the
fermentation the hydrogen content in the biogas reached onaverage 54.05% /C60.99.
16S rDNA cloning technique allowed to gain a deeper
insight in the community composition and heterogeneity. TheGCL community was characterized by a well-deﬁned structureand was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae (90%), with the
genera Klebsiella and Escherichia /Shigella , followed by Bur-
kholderiaceae (10%) with genus Cupriavidus . The importance ofmetabolic cooperation mechanisms such as syntrophism and/
or cross-feeding has been discussed.
The role of main hydrogen producers in the GCL commu-
nity may be attributed to Klebsiella sp. and E. coli sp., while the
exact contribution of C. metallidurans and S. sonnei still need to
be clearly understood and will be further investigated.
In conclusion we can state that the eco-biotechnological
approach turned out to be a valuable tool for selecting a suit-
able microbial pool, able to effectively convert different glyc-erol types into hydrogen. Moreover, the possibility to obtaina highly efﬁcient conversion of biodiesel-derived crude glyc-erol in non-sterile conditions (with the same efﬁciency of pure
glycerol, in sterile conditions) can also contribute to signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the operation costs of the process, especially ona larger/industrial scale.
