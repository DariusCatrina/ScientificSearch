Bacterial Chitinase System as a Model
of Chitin Biodegradation
Takafumi Itoh and Hisashi Kimoto
Abstract Chitin, a structural polysaccharide of b-1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
residues, is the second most abundant natural biopolymer after cellulose. The meta-bolism of chitin affects the global carbon and nitrogen cycles, which are maintained
by marine and soil-dwelling bacteria. The degradation products of chitin metabolism
serve as important nutrient sources for the chitinolytic bacteria. Chitinolytic bacteriahave elaborate enzymatic systems for the degradation of the recalcitrant chitinbiopolymer. This chapter introduces chitin degradation and utilization systems ofthe chitinolytic bacteria. These bacteria secrete many chitin-degrading enzymes,including processive chitinases, endo-acting non-processive chitinases, lytic polysac-charide monooxygenases, and N-acetyl-hexosaminidases. Bacterial chitinases play a
fundamental role in the degradation of chitin. Enzymatic properties, catalytic mecha-
nisms, and three-dimensional structures of chitinases have been extensively studied by
many scientists. These enzymes can be exploited to produce a range of chitin-derivedproducts, e.g., biocontrol agents against many plant pathogenic fungi and insects. Weintroduce bacterial chitinases in terms of their reaction modes and structural features.

7.1 Introduction
Chitin, a linear homopolymer of b-1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc)
residues, is widespread in nature and serves as a structural component in the cellwalls of fungi, and the exoskeletons of insects, arthropods, sponges, and squid pens

(Gooday 1990a ,b). Chitin is classi ﬁed by its crystalline forms, such as a-,b-, and
c-chitin, differing in the orientation of the micro ﬁbrils. To form complex structures
in the cell walls, the crystalline chitin often associates with some proteins, or withother polysaccharides, such as glucans and mannans (Attwood and Zola 1967 ;
Austin et al. 1981 Schaefer et al. 1987 ; Merzendorfer and Zimoch 2003 ).
In accordance with the abundance and ubiquity of chitin, chitin-degrading enzymes(or chitin-related proteins) have ubiquitous distribution across bacteria, fungi(Gooday 1990a ), archaea (Andronopoulou and Vorgias 2004 ), algae (Shirota et al.
2008 ; Kitaoku et al. 2017 ), plants (Grover 2012 ), and animals (Gooday 1990a ).
Although annual chitin production in natural ecosystems is estimated to be10
10–1012tons, most of the chitin is recycled by bacteria and fungi as their carbon
and nitrogen sources (Tharanathan and Kittur 2003 ).
Bacterial responses to chitin include chemotaxis and chemotropism, when the
bacteria either migrate toward the chitin source or grow toward it; adhesion to chitin;secretion of extracellular chitin-degrading enzymes; and uptake of chitin oligosac-charides (Keyhani and Roseman 1999 ; Li and Roseman 2004 ; Meibom et al. 2005 ).
Bacterial chitinolysis, the main step in chitin utilization, typically consists of threeenzymatic steps, namely breaking down of crystalline chitin, hydrolyzing chitinchains into dimers, and dividing the dimers into monomers. In the extracellularenvironments, the ﬁrst two steps are usually catalyzed by three types of enzymes,
lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO), endo-acting non-processive chiti-
nases, and processive chitinases. LPMOs, classi ﬁed as auxiliary activity
(AA) families 10 and 11 in the CAZy database (Lombard et al. 2014 ), cleave
glycosidic bonds on the surface of crystalline chitin by an oxidative reaction andintroduce oxidized ends to promote further degradation by other secreted chitinases.Chitinases are typically grouped into glycoside hydrolase families 18 and 19 (GH18and GH19). GH19 chitinases are found mostly in plants, nematodes, and somemembers of Streptomycetaceae (Ohno et al. 1996 ; Shimosaka et al. 2001 ;
Lacombe-Harvey et al. 2018 ). The amino acid sequences of the two GH families
share little or no similarities and their catalytic mechanisms are entirely different. Ithas been hypothesized that GH18 and GH19 chitinases have evolved separately(Fukamizo 2000 ). These chitinases are often regulated and induced by N-acet-
ylglucosamine (GlcNAc monomer), a product of chitin hydrolysis (Bassler et al.1991 ), or chitin oligomers (GlcNAc)
n, where n = 2 to 6 (Uchiyama et al. 2003 ).
GlcNAc has also been reported to act as a suppressor of chitinase expression in somestrains of Streptomyces (Miyashita et al. 2000 ) and Paenibacillus (Itoh et al. 2013 ).
After the extracellular hydrolysis of chitin polysaccharides into monomers and
oligomers, the products are imported into the periplasm or cytoplasm of the bacteriaby ef ﬁcient uptake systems. In some bacterial strains, phosphoenolpyruvate-
dependent phosphotransferase systems (PTS) and ATP-binding cassette(ABC) transporters are responsible for the respective uptakes of GlcNAc monomersand oligomers (Berg et al. 2007 ; Colson et al.2008 ;Świątek et al. 2012a ). In the
cytoplasm or the periplasmic space, b-N-acetyl-hexosaminidases, usually classi ﬁed
as GH3 or GH20, cleave the imported chitin oligomers into GlcNAc (Ito et al. 2013 ;
Macdonald et al. 2015 ).132 T. Itoh and H. Kimoto
Chitinolytic bacteria, such as Serratia marcescens (Vaaje-Kolstad et al. 2013 ),
Bacillus circulans WL-12 (Watanabe et al. 1990 ),Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)
(Saito et al. 2007 ),Vibrio cholerae (Li and Roseman 2004 ), and Paenibacillus sp.
(Itoh et al. 2013 ; Kusaoke et al. 2017 ), produce many chitinases for ef ﬁcient
degradation of chitin. Nucleotide sequences of these chitinases are often almost
completely conserved. This genetic conservation could be explained by the multiple
gene duplication in a single cell. However, there are some bacteria that possess gene
clusters of chitinases with unique sequences, thought to be acquired from other
organisms via lateral gene transfer (Hunt et al. 2008 ).
7.2 Chitin Biodegradation System of Serratia marcescens
Serratia marcescens is one of the most ef ﬁcient bacteria for the degradation of
chitin (Monreal and Reese 1969 ) and has been extensively studied as the model for
bacterial chitinolysis. Serratia is a genus of rod-shaped Gram-negative bacteria
in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Production of chitin-degrading enzymes in
S. marcescens can be induced by the presence of chitin in the culture medium
(Monreal and Reese 1969 ).S. marcescens strain QMB1466 produces ﬁve different
chitinolytic enzymes (Fuchs et al. 1986 ). These enzymes are named as ChiA, ChiB,
ChiC1, ChiC2, and CBP21; ChiA and ChiB, two processive chitinases, produce
disaccharides from chitin chain by sliding along the chain in opposite directions,
i.e., ChiA from the reducing end and ChiB from the nonreducing end (Horn et al.
2006 ); ChiC1 and ChiC2, endo-acting non-processive chitinases, hydrolyze the
chitin polymers randomly; and CBP21 is an LPMO that introduces chain breaks by
oxidative cleavages (Vaaje-Kolstad et al. 2013 ) (Fig. 7.1). ChiC2 results from a
posttranslational cleavage of ChiC1; the hydrolytic activity of ChiC2 is lower than
that of ChiC1 on crystalline chitin (Suzuki et al. 1999 ). The biological function of
Fig. 7.1 Chitinolytic enzymes of Serratia marcescens . The catalytic domains of S. marcescens
chitinases (ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC) belong to GH18. ChiA and ChiB are processive chitinases that
bind closely to the ends of the detached chitin chain and release (GlcNAc) 2. ChiC works as an
endo-acting non-processive chitinase. CBP21 is an AA10 LPMO and breaks chitin chain by
oxidative cleavages7 Bacterial Chitinase System as a Model of Chitin Biodegradation 133
the posttranslational cleavage of ChiC1 remains unclear. These chitin-degrading
enzymes work synergistically on chitin degradation (Suzuki et al. 2002 ). In
the cytoplasm or the periplasmic space, N-acetyl-hexosaminidase (chitobiase)
hydrolyzes oligosaccharides to GlcNAc. According to the CAZy database, in
S. marcescens , all chitinases (ChiA, B, C1, and C2) belong to GH18, chitobiases
belong to GH20, and CBP21 belongs to AA10.
7.3 Chitin Biodegradation System of Bacillus circulans
WL-12
Bacillus circulans WL-12, a Gram-positive and rod-shaped cell, has been identi ﬁed
as a chitinolytic bacterium that degrades chitin in the cell walls of yeasts and fungi
and is known to secrete multiple polysaccharide-degrading enzymes into the culturemedia (Rombouts and Phaff 1976 ; Watanabe et al. 1990 ). When grown in the
presence of chitin, over 10 chitinases have been detected in the supernatant of thebacterial culture (Watanabe et al. 1990 ; Alam et al. 1996 ). These chitinases are
derived from three genes, chiA,chiC, and chiD. Their gene products, ChiA, ChiC,
and ChiD, are multi-modular chitinases and their posttranslational cleavages pro-duce multiple chitinases in the culture supernatant. ChiA1, one of the cleavage
products, the highest colloidal chitinase activity among others; it yields predomi-
nantly a dimer (GlcNAc)
2by binding to insoluble chitin. The structure of ChiA1
contains an N-terminal GH18 catalytic domain, two ﬁbronectin type III (FnIII)
domains, and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module belonging to CBM12. Thecatalytic domain of ChiA1 has a deep substrate-binding cleft. On the cleft surface,aromatic residues are linearly located and are important for crystalline chitinhydrolysis (Watanabe et al. 2003 ).
7.4 Chitin Biodegradation System of Streptomyces species
Bacteria in the genus Streptomyces belong to a group of high GC content,
Gram-positive bacteria (Actinomycetes) that have an extensive chitinolytic systemsupported by multiple chitinases (Berger and Reynolds 1958 ; Saito et al. 1999 ;
Schrempf 2001 ; Kawase et al. 2006 ; Saito et al. 2007 ). In the S. coelicolor A3(2)
genome, 13 chitinases have been found to date; 11 of these have been classi ﬁed in
the GH18 family of chitinases: subfamily A (Chi18aC, Chi18aD, Chi18aE, andChi18aJ), subfamily B (Chi18bA, Chi18bB, and Chi18bI), and subfamilyC (Chi18cH, Chi18cK, Chi18cL, and Chi18 cM), and two in the GH19 family ofchitinases (Chi19F and Chi19G) (Kawase et al. 2006 ). Besides chitinases,
S. coelicolor A3(2) secretes chitosan-related enzymes, such as GH46 chitobiase
(Ghinet et al. 2010 ), GH20 chitobiase (Saito et al. 2013 ), and CE4 chitin
deacetylase ( Świątek et al. 2012b ). The metabolism of chitin oligosaccharides in134 T. Itoh and H. Kimoto
S. coelicolor A3(2) is well understood ( Świątek et al. 2012a ,b) (Fig. 7.2). The
degradation monomer product, GlcNAc, is imported and phosphorylated to
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P) by the PTS through the cell
membrane. In the PTS reactions, a phosphoryl group is transferred from phos-
phoenolpyruvate to phosphotransferase enzyme I (EI) and then the group is
transferred from EI to histidine protein (HPr). The phosphoryl group of HPr is
further transferred to the enzyme complex of enzyme IIA (EIIA), enzyme IIB
(EIIB), and enzyme IIC (EIIC). GlcNAc, transported by enzyme IIC (EIIC), is
phosphorylated to GlcNAc-6P by EIIA. Some ABC transporters, like
NgcEFG-MsiK and DasABC-MsiK, can also transport (GlcNAc) 2dimers.
Transported (GlcNAc) 2dimer is divided into GlcNAc monomers by b-N-
acetyl-D-glucosaminidase (DasD) in the cytoplasm. An N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
kinase (NagK) phosphorylates GlcNAc to GlcNAc-6P, which is then deacetylated
to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P) by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6-phosphate
deacetylase (NagA). Thereafter, glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB)
deaminates GlcN-6P to fructose-6-phosphate (Frc-6P) that would enter the gly-
colytic pathway.
Fig. 7.2 Chitin uptake by Streptomyces species. Chitin is hydrolyzed into GlcNAc and
(GlcNAc) 2by GH18 and GH19 chitinases in the extracellular space. The degradation product,
GlcNAc, is transported through PTS across the cell membrane and is phosphorylated to
GlcNAc-6P by the PTS. An ABC transporter, NgcEFG-MsiK can import GlcNAc and (GlcNAc) 2.
Another ABC transporter, DasABC-MsiK, can also import (GlcNAc) 2. Imported (GlcNAc) 2is
hydrolyzed into GlcNAc by chitobiase (DasD). GlcNAc is phosphorylated to GlcNAc-6P by
GlcNAc kinase (NagK). GlcNAc-6P deacetylase (NagA) converts GlcNAc-6P to GlcN-6P, which
is then deaminated to Frc-6P by GlcN-6P deaminase (NagB). Frc-6P would enter the glycolytic
pathway7 Bacterial Chitinase System as a Model of Chitin Biodegradation 135
7.5 Chitin Biodegradation System of Marine Bacteria
Vibrio species
Despite being a ubiquitous biopolymer, chitin is not known to accumulate in ocean
sediments; marine chitinolytic bacteria, mainly from the family Vibrionaceae,
contribute to the rapid recycling of chitin (Hirono et al. 1998 ). Chitinolytic and
signal transduction systems of Vibrio species have been widely studied. The system
constitutes ﬁve processes: ﬁnding chitin (chemotaxis); adhering to chitin via the
bacterial cell surface; degrading chitin to oligosaccharides; transporting the
degraded oligosaccharides to the cytoplasm by a sugar-speci ﬁc porin (chitoporin)
on the outer membrane and by a sugar-speci ﬁc ABC transporter on the inner
membrane; and converting the degradation products to Frc-6P in the cytosol for the
glycolytic pathway (Keyhani and Roseman 1999 ; Li and Roseman 2004 ; Meibom
et al. 2004 ; Hunt et al. 2008 ). Inducing chitinolytic enzymes of Vibrio species is
intricately regulated by histidine kinases and two-component systems. In the resting
state, a binding protein for chitin oligosaccharides (CBP) binds to the periplasmic
domain of the membrane protein ChiS. When secreted chitinases degrade chitin to
oligosaccharides in the extracellular space, the oligosaccharides are transported by
the chitoporin and are bound by the CBP. In the binding state, the CBP/ChiS
complex dissociates and transports the signal to express the chitinolytic genes
(Fig. 7.3). The domain of ChiS in the cytoplasmic space is composed of three
subdomains: the ATP-dependent His kinase/phosphatase (HK) domain; the Asp
response regulator (RR) domain; and the histidine phosphotransfer (HP) domain.
Fig. 7.3 Induction of chitinolytic enzymes of Vibrio species. The induction is regulated by a
histidine kinase and a two-component system (ChiS). In the resting state, chitin-binding protein
(CBP) binds to the periplasmic domain of the membrane protein ChiS. When the oligosaccharides
bind to CBP, the CBP/ChiS complex dissociates and transports the signal for the expression of
chitin-degrading enzymes136 T. Itoh and H. Kimoto
The phosphoryl group is transferred sequentially from ATP to HK, to RR, to HP,
andﬁnally to Asp on a response regulator that interacts with the genome to induce
the expression of chitinolytic enzymes (Li and Roseman 2004 ).
7.6 Chitin Biodegradation Systems of Paenibacillus
sp. str. IK-5 and FPU-7
Similar to the Streptomyces species, Paenibacillus sp. str. IK-5 produces a chi-
tosanase (ChiE) and a GH19 chitinase (ChiD) in addition to two GH18 chitinases
(ChiA and ChiB) and an AA10 LPMO (ChiC) (Kusaoke et al. 2017 ; Fig. 7.4). The
two chitinases (ChiA and ChiB) contain one GH18 catalytic domain and two
CBM5 chitin-binding modules. The AA10 LPMO (ChiC) also has a CBM5 module
in addition to the catalytic domain. The chitinase ChiD has a GH19 catalytic
domain. Chitosanase (ChiE) contains a GH8 catalytic domain at the N-terminus and
two discoidin domains (CBM32) at the C-terminus. The CBM32 domains of ChiE
can bind speci ﬁcally and tightly to chitosan. These ﬁve enzymes (ChiA, ChiB,
ChiC, ChiD, and ChiE) form a huge protein complex called a “chitinasome ”. When
the culture medium contains only chitin, the complex consists of four enzymes
(ChiA, ChiB, ChiC, and ChiD); when the culture medium contains both chitin and
chitosan, the complex comprises all ﬁve enzymes. Paenibacillus sp. str. IK-5 cells
also produce multi-modular chitobiase composed of the GH20 catalytic domain and
S-layer homology domains (SLH) on their surface.
Fig. 7.4 Schematic representations of the P. str. IK-5 chitin and chitosan degrading enzymes. The
enzymes (ChiA, ChiB, ChiC, ChiD, and ChiE) are produced by P. str. IK-5 and have signal
peptides for secretion at the N-terminus. ChiA and ChiB are GH18 chitinases with catalytic
domains at the N-terminus and two CBM 5 domains at the C-terminus. ChiC has an AA10
catalytic domain as LPMO and a CBM5 at the C-terminus. The catalytic domain of ChiD belongs
to GH19. Chitosanase ChiE contains a GH8 catalytic domain at the N-terminus and two CBM32 at
the C-terminus. These chitin and chitosan-related enzymes (ChiA, ChiB, ChiC, ChiD, and ChiE)
are found as a huge protein complex (chitinasome). When the culture medium contains chitin and
chitosan, ChiE is assembled into four enzyme complexes (ChiA, ChiB, ChiC, and ChiD)7 Bacterial Chitinase System as a Model of Chitin Biodegradation 137
Paenibacillus sp. str. FPU-7 ( P. str. FPU-7), a bacterium with high chitinolytic
activity, was recently isolated from soil using a medium containing solid chitinﬂakes (Itoh et al. 2013 ). Subject to carbon catabolite repression by GlcNAc, the
bacterium constitutively secretes several chitinases into the culture medium. Genes
for at least six chitinases (ChiA, ChiB, ChiC, ChiD, ChiE, and ChiF) are found in
the genome, each containing a GH18 catalytic domain and one or more auxiliarydomains, such as CBM5, CBM12, and FnIII. On a synthetic substrate, pNP-(GlcNAc)
2, ChiE shows high activity; ChiA, ChiD, and ChiF are less active; ChiB
and ChiC are moderately active. All the chitinases, except ChiD, are highly activeon insoluble colloidal chitin. Ef ﬁcient degradation of chitin ﬂakes by P. str. FPU-7
requires not only the chitinase secretions in the culture medium, but also the livingcells, suggesting an involvement of cell-bound chitinase(s). Apart from the six
chitinases extensively studied in its genome, chitinase ChiW is expressed on the
cell surface of P.str. FPU-7 in the presence of (GlcNAc)
2. ChiW produces
(GlcNAc) 2as the ﬁnal reaction product on the cell surface. The product (GlcNAc) 2
would then be transported into the cytosol by some transporters and induce the
chitin-related gene expression such as ChiW.
7.7 Overview of Bacterial GH18 Chitinases
Chitinolytic bacteria secrete multiple chitinases as described above. Some bacterialchitinases can be active over a range of temperatures and pH (Meena et al. 2014 ;
Rathore and Gupta 2015 ) and, thus, these enzymes are used in many industrial
processes. Some of these enzymes also have antifungal and antibacterial propertiesand are used as biocontrol agents against many plant pathogenic fungi and insects,since chitin is a major constituent of fungal cell walls and insect cuticles
(Bhattacharya et al. 2007 ; Rathore and Gupta 2015 ).
These bacterial chitinases are typically classi ﬁed in the GH18 and GH19 families;
as described above, bacterial chitinolysis is mainly carried out by GH18 chitinases.Based on their amino acid sequences, bacterial GH18 chitinases can be separated intothree subfamilies, A, B, and C (Li and Greene 2010 ). Subfamily A chitinases have a
small subdomain, chitin insertion domain (CID), in the TIM-barrel. CID is absent inthe chitinases belonging to subfamilies B and C. Bacterial GH18 chitinases areusually multi-modular. For example, in S.marcescens , in addition to the catalytic
domains, ChiA (SmChiA) contains an N-terminal FnIII domain; SmChiB contains a
CBM5 at the C-terminus; SmChiC contains a FnIII domain and CBM12 at theC-terminus (Vaaje-Kolstad et al. 2013 ). Similarly, B.circulans WL-12 ChiA1
(BcChiA1) contains two FnIII and CBM12 domains at the C-terminus (Watanabeet al. 2003 ). Considering the enzymatic reaction modes, GH18 chitinases are clas-
siﬁed into two types: processive chitinases and endo-acting non-processive chiti-
nases. These chitin-degrading enzymes synergistically operate on the polymers. First,non-processive chitinases and LPMO break the glycosidic bond of surface-bound138 T. Itoh and H. Kimoto
crystalline chitin. Then, the newly produced terminuses of the detached chains from
the solid surface become the sites for the attachment of processive chitinases.
Many crystal structures of bacterial GH18 chitinases are available on the Protein
Data Bank. The typical catalytic domain of GH18 chitinase folds a TIM-barrel
consisting of a substrate-binding cleft (Perrakis et al. 1994 ). GH18 chitinases
hydrolyze chitin through a substrate-assisted mechanism that retains the stereo-
chemistry of the anomeric carbon of the newly synthesized reducing end (Tews et al.
1997 ; Brameld and Goddard 1998 ; van Aalten et al. 2001 ) (Fig. 7.5). The catalytic
residues are in a conserved DxDxE motif located on fourth b-strand of the core
barrel. The catalysis is initiated with a distortion into a boat (or skewed boat)
conformation of the GlcNAc residue at the -1 subsite. Substrate binding leads the
rotation of a second aspartic acid residue of the DxDxE motif from the ﬁrst aspartic
acid to the catalytic glutamic acid of the DxDxE motif. The second aspartic acid
residue then forms hydrogen bonds with the glutamic acid and the N-acetyl group of
GlcNAc at the -1 subsite. The catalytic glutamic acid protonates the glycosidic bond
followed by a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon by the oxygen atom of the
N-acetyl group. After the scission of the glycosidic bond, an oxazolinium ion
intermediate is formed and subsequently hydrolyzed to complete the reaction. Other
Fig. 7.5 Substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism of GH18 chitinase. The catalysis is initiated
when the GlcNAc residue at the -1 subsite is distorted into a boat conformation. The catalytic
glutamic acid protonates the glycosidic bond. This is followed by a nucleophilic attack on the
anomeric carbon by the oxygen atom of N-acetyl group of the substrate GlcNAc at the -1 subsite.
After the scission of the glycosidic bond, an oxazolinium ion intermediate is formed and is
subsequently hydrolyzed7 Bacterial Chitinase System as a Model of Chitin Biodegradation 139
conserved residues, tyrosine, and aspartic acid (or asparagine), interact with GlcNAc
residues at the subsite −1 and thus, serve as important residues for catalysis.
Chitooligosaccharides (CHOS) produced by the hydrolysis of chitin have
potential biological applications in the food, medicine, and agriculture sectors.
Depending on the length and pattern of acetylation, CHOS exhibit antimicrobial,
antitumor, and immuno-enhancing properties (Mallakuntla et al. 2017 ). Since the
chemical synthesis of CHOS involves nonspeci ﬁc random hydrolysis, controlling
the length of the product is very dif ﬁcult. Besides hydrolytic activities, some GH18
chitinases exhibit transglycosylation (TG) activities. The enzymes can condensateother saccharide molecules without a water molecule as an acceptor, with the oxa-zolinium ion intermediate as a donor (Umemoto et al. 2015 ). TG activities, focusing
on the enzymatic production of longer CHOS from shorter oligosaccharides, have
received considerable attention. TG activities of GH18 are improved by mutagen-
esis. Mutations on speci ﬁc sites can reduce the hydrolytic activities and optimize the
subsite af ﬁnities and/or stability of the oxazolium ion intermediate. Mutations of
aspartates in the DXDXE sequence motif affect the stability of the oxazolium ionintermediate and reduce hydrolytic activities. As a result, these mutant enzymesexhibit improved TG activities. Mutations of aromatic residues in the minus subsite(donor site), such as W167A in the −3 subsite of SmChiA; Y163A and Y390F in the
-1 subsite of SmChiA; and Y28A and Y222A in the −1 subsite of Serratia pro-
teamaculans ChiD (SpChiD), are known to enhance the TG activities of the
enzymes. In contrast to the minus subsite (donor site), introducing aromatic sidechains and increasing hydrophobicity at the +1 and +2 subsite surfaces, such asY226W of SpChiD, also improve the TG activities (Madhuprakash et al. 2018 ).
7.8 Structure and Function of GH18 Processive Chitinases
The GH18 processive chitinases bind single polymer chains detached from the
crystalline chitin in the long tunnels or deep clefts of the TIM-barrel, hydrolyzeglycosidic bonds along the same chain, and release disaccharides (GlcNAc)
2, before
dissociation from the chain (Vaaje-Kolstad et al. 2013 ). Processive chitinases often
have a subdomain, CID, as described previously. The CID is composed of ﬁve or
six antiparallel b-strands and a a-helix. The CID forms a wall alongside the
substrate-binding cleft by inserting itself between the seventh and eighth b-strand of
the core barrel. It has been suggested that the CID interacts with the substrate
through four conserved amino acid residues (Li and Greene 2010 ). Besides the TIM
domain and the CID, processive chitinases, such as SmChiA, SmChiB, andBcChiA1, contain one or two additional domains. (Fig. 7.6a, b, d). Removal of
these extra domains reduces the biological activities of the crystalline forms ofchitin. Aromatic residues such as tryptophan that are localized in thesubstrate-binding clefts function as ﬂexible hydrophobic sheaths for binding of the
polymer chain and thereby, improve the processivity of the chitin. The polymer
chain can slide during the processive action in the sheath. The W97A mutation at140 T. Itoh and H. Kimoto
the subsite +1 of SmChiB reduces the processivity and the degradation activity for
crystalline chitin. However, W97A mutation also causes a 29-fold increase in thedegradation rate of single chains (Hamre et al. 2014 ). The processivity seems to be
counterbalanced by the catalytic ef ﬁciency of the reaction. On the other hand,
Watanabe et al. reported that the W433 and Y279 mutants of BcChiA1 exhibitedreduced hydrolytic activity against crystalline chitin, colloidal chitin, and(GlcNAc)
5(Watanabe et al. 2001 ,2003 ). The W433 residue interacts with GlcNAc
at subsite −1 through a hydrophobic stacking interaction and holds the residue at
this position during the catalytic reaction. The Y279 residue assists the formation of
an oxazolinium ion intermediate. In addition to the amino acid residues in thesubstrate-binding cleft, there are two extra tryptophan residues, W122 and W134,on the surface of BcChiA1. These tryptophan residues are located at the extensionof the nonreducing end side of the substrate. Mutations at both these sites reduce the

2003 ). The direction of the sliding action of processive chitinases differs in each
enzyme. For instance, SmChiA cleaves disaccharides from the reducing end ofchitin, while SmChiB does so from the nonreducing end (Hult et al. 2005 ; Horn
et al. 2006 ; Sikorski et al. 2006 ).
7.9 Structure and Function of GH18 Non-processive
Endo-Chitinases
The GH18 endo-acting non-processive chitinases have a tendency to randomly
hydrolyze glycosidic linkages in disordered (or amorphous) regions of crystalline
chitin (Payne et al. 2012 ). The processive chitinases have closed tunnels or deep
clefts with highly conserved aromatic residues, in particular, tryptophan residues,that interact with the ligand for the processive action (described above in 7.8). Incontrast, the endo-acting non-processive chitinases exhibit open (or shallow) cleftslacking the CID subdomain and have a few aromatic amino acids on the cleftsurfaces. Both the processive chitinases and the endo-acting non-processive chiti-nases are often multi-modular. For instance, SmChiC has two extra domains,CBM12 (for chitin binding) and FnIII domain (Fig. 7.6c). These CBMs of the
non-processive enzymes may loosely associate with the substrate for assisting the
activity of the endo-acting non-processive enzymes.
7.10 Structure and Function of the Carbohydrate-Binding
Modules of GH18 Chitinases
In addition to the catalytic domain, bacterial GH18 chitinases often contain single
or multiple CBMs or FnIII domains, as described above. These extra domains can
be found either in the N-terminal or in the C-terminal of the enzyme (Fig. 7.6).
The structures and functions of the CBMs responsible for binding crystallinepolysaccharides, such as chitin and cellulose, are well studied (Boraston 2005 ;
Georgelis, et al. 2012 ). Although their contribution to the ef ﬁciency of catalysis is
not yet completely understood, CBMs associate with the crystalline polysaccharidesubstrates and position them correctly to the catalytic domains. The four types ofroles that CBMs have in chitinolysis include: (a) targeting effect, where CBMs
target the enzymes to appropriate regions on their substrates (reducing end,
nonreducing end, or internal of polysaccharide chains); (b) proximity effect, whereCBMs increase the concentrations of the enzymes in close proximity to theirsubstrates and lead the catalytic domains to ef ﬁciently act on their substrates;
(c) disruptive effect, where some CBMs bind to polysaccharides and disrupt thesurface of tightly packed chains, thereby, loosening and exposing the packedsubstrates to be attacked by their catalytic domains; and (d) adhesion, where some142 T. Itoh and H. Kimoto
CBMs have functions to adhere enzymes onto the surfaces of bacterial cell walls.
The catalytic domains break the neighboring substrate polymer chains. Cell wallsare complex structures; thus, the binding targets of CBMs are not always theintrinsic substrate polysaccharides for their catalytic domains. Some CBMs have
broad speci ﬁcity for various polysaccharides in the cell walls.
The CBM5 and CBM12 modules consist of 40 –60 residues and are often found
in GH18 chitinases (Fig. 7.6). Both the families have similar amino acid sequences
and have conserved aromatic tryptophan residues that interact with the substrate onthe protein surface. The presence of either of these modules increases the substrateafﬁnity and the ef ﬁciency of chitin hydrolysis, especially for crystalline chitin
(Watanabe et al. 1994 ; Hashimoto et al. 2000 ; Uni et al. 2012 ).
All the FnIIIs domains consist of 80 –100 residues and share amino acid
sequence similarities. Each FnIII domain folds into a typical immunoglobulin-like
(b-sandwich) fold with three and four strands (Fig. 7.6a). The FnIII of SmChiA
(also referred to as chitinase A N-terminal domain) contains exposed aromaticresidues responsible for substrate binding, thereby, improving the catalytic ef ﬁ-
ciency of the enzyme (Uchiyama et al. 2001 ). In contrast, the FnIII domain of
BcChiA1 does not have surface-exposed aromatic residues and is not directlyinvolved in the chitin binding (Jee et al. 2002 ). Studies suggest that the latter types
of FnIII domains serve as linker domains for the adequate stabilization of other
domains or of the overall structure of the enzyme for a competent degradation.
7.11 Cell Surface-Expressed Multi-modular Chitinase
ChiW from Paenibacillus sp. FPU-7
The Gram-positive bacterium P. str. FPU-7 effectively hydrolyzes chitin with
several secreted chitinases, as described above. This bacterium produces a unique
chitinase, ChiW that has two catalytic domains. This multi-modular enzyme is
expressed on the cell surface and has a high activity toward various chitins,including crystalline chitins (Itoh et al. 2013 ,2014 ,2016 ). The cell surface-
expressed enzyme, ChiW, enhances chitin degradation when it acts in combinationwith other secreted chitinases of P. FPU-7 (Itoh et al. 2013 ). ChiW contains 1,418
amino acids with a secretory signal peptide (150 kDa). The unique multi-modulararchitecture of ChiW allows it to function ef ﬁciently on the cell surface via three
surface layer homology domains (SLH), a right-handed b-helix domain (CBM54), a
Gly-Ser-rich loop, two immunoglobulin-like fold domains (Ig-1 and Ig-2), and two
GH18 catalytic domains (Figs. 7.7and7.8).
The SLH domains are absent in the ChiW crystal structure. Typical SLH
domains are composed of three repeats of highly conserved amino acid sequences(*18 kDa) and bind noncovalently to glycan backbones of the peptidoglycan of
Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, the cell wall is surrounded by proteins congregatedwith SLH domains as a cell envelope or surface layer (Schneewind and Missiakas2012 ).7 Bacterial Chitinase System as a Model of Chitin Biodegradation 143
The CBM54 ﬂexibly links to the catalytic region (two Ig-like domains and two
GH18 domains) of ChiW via the Gly-Ser-rich loop. The structure of CBM54consists of a right-handed parallel b-helix fold with 12 coils (Fig. 7.8a). There are
34b-strands that form 3 parallel b-sheets, named SB1 (made of 12 b-strands), SB2
(made of 12 b-strands), and SB3 (made of 10 b-strands), making 3 distorted faces.
Although this fold is often found in enzymes such as carbohydrate lyases, CBM54of ChiW displays no detectable carbohydrate degradation activities. The domainpossesses diverse substrate speci ﬁcities and can therefore, bind to several cell wall
polysaccharides, including chitin, chitosan, b-1,3-glucan, xylan, and cellulose. This
domain putatively helps in an ef ﬁcient decomposition of the cell wall chitin through
the contact surface. However, the molecular surface of CBM54 has no distinct cleftor patch surrounded by aromatic residues.
The two GH18 catalytic domains of ChiW have similar structures, consistent
with their high degree of amino acid sequence similarity (56% identity) (Fig. 7.8d
and e). The structures of the catalytic clefts of the two domains are also similar.Besides the core TIM-barrels, both have two additional subdomains, CID and
insertion domain 2; the two subdomains protrude from the barrel and form the walls
of a deep active cleft of approximately 42 Åin length and 26 Åin depth. The amino
acid residues at the center of the two active sites are almost identical and wellconserved in other processive GH18 chitinases. Important residues of SmChiA forsaccharide binding, Trp167 at the −3 subsite, Trp539 at the −1 subsite, Trp275 at

the +1 subsite, and Phe396 at the +2 subsite, correspond to the ChiW residues
Trp568/Trp1055, Trp905/Trp1396, Trp652/Trp1138, and Trp772/Trp1258,respectively. The catalytic residues of SmChiA, Tyr390, Asp311, Asp313, andGlu315 correspond to Tyr766/Tyr1252, Asp687/Asp1173, Asp689/Asp1175, andGlu691/Glu1177, respectively. These conserved residues indicate that ChiW pos-sesses a catalytic mechanism that is similar to that of SmChiA and other typicalprocessive chitinases. In the processive chitinases, CBMs or FnIII domains often

right-handed parallel b-helix structure with 12 coils. bThe Ig-1 structure is an eight-stranded

locate along their catalytic domains and assist in the processive degradation of one
chitin chain (Fig. 7.6). For example, SmChiA has one FnIII domain that forms a
minus subsite, which leads to enzymatic degradation of chitin from the reducingends with the production of (GlcNAc)
2residues (Fig. 7.6a), whereas SmChiB, with
a CBM5 on the opposite side forms a plus subsite, degrades the polymer from the
nonreducing ends and also produces (GlcNAc) 2residues (Fig. 7.6b). However,
ChiW catalytic domains have neither such FnIII domain nor CBM, they insteadhave two Ig-like fold domains (Ig-1 and Ig-2). The Ig-1 structure is composed of aneight-stranded b-sandwich fold containing two four-stranded antiparallel b-sheets
closely stacked upon each other (Fig. 7.8b). The structure of Ig-2 is a
seven-stranded b-sandwich with two antiparallel b-sheets composed of three and
fourb-strands (Fig. 7.8c). Aromatic residues are located on the surface of the two
Ig-like fold domains, i.e., Tyr486, Tyr537, and Phe556 on the surface of Ig-1;
Tyr939, Tyr948, Tyr1000, and Phe1044 on the surface of Ig-2. The Ig-1 and Ig-2domains might be functional substitutions of CBM. However, the two Ig-likedomains are too distal from the catalytic clefts to function as a CBM; they mightserve as linkers or scaffolds for the two catalytic domains (Fig. 7.7). The
substrate-binding sites of ChiW, surrounded by aromatic residues, are shorter inlength to those of SmChiA. Possibly, the lack of a general CBM and the short activeclefts allow ChiW to transfer from chain to chain with low processivity on the cell
surface.
Although ChiW is a monomer, the enzyme is cleaved between Asn282 and
Ser283 at CBM54 by self-splicing (Fig. 7.7). The trigger for this self-splicing
remains unresolved. The location of this cleavage site is on the SB2 face and infront of the 11th b-strand at the fourth coil from the N-terminus of CBM54. The
2 polypeptides bind tightly to each other with 13 hydrogen bonds between the thirdand fourth coils and they retain the b-helix fold. At the cleavage site, there are four
highly conserved amino acid residues, Ser283, His285, Asp262, and Arg304. In
addition to these residues, there are successive glycine residues near the site, pre-
sumably providing conformational ﬂexibility to the cleavage site. This limited
proteolysis occurs using the hydroxyl group of Ser283 as a nucleophile. The aminoacid residues of this cleavage site, Asn-Ser, have been found in various self-splicingproteins (Clarke 1994 ; Hall et al. 1997 ).
On the other hand, chitinases with two GH18 catalytic domains have been found
in viruses, archaea, bacteria, and insects (Hiramatsu et al. 2000 ; Tanaka et al. 2001 ;
Howard et al. 2004 ; Arakane and Muthukrishnan 2010 ). Chitinase, Tk-ChiA, from
the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 (Tanaka et al.
2001 ) and chitinase B from Microbulbifer degradans 2–40 (Howard et al. 2004 )
have an exo-chitinase at the N-terminus and an endo-chitinase at the C-terminus. Insome chitinases, the two catalytic domains work synergistically, because theircombined activities exhibit a signi ﬁcantly higher chitinolysis than the sum of their
individual activities. The two clefts of ChiW are adequately positioned by the twoIg-like domains and cross each other at approximately right angles. This uniquespatial arrangement may be important for the ef ﬁcient degradation of chitin on the
cell surface.146 T. Itoh and H. Kimoto
