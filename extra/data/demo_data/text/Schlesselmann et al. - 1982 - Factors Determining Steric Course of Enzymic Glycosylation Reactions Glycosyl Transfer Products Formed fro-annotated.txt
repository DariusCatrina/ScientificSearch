abstract: Glycosyl transfer products were formed from
2.6-anhydro-l-deoxy-D-g/«co-hept-l-enitol (heptenitol) by
purified  -glucosidases from Candida tropicalis andriceand
byaninverting exo-a-glucanase (glucodextranase) from Ar-
throbacter globiformis. The productswere structurally defined
through  and 13CNMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)
spectra oftheir crystalline per-O-acetates incomparison with
those ofauthentic methyl l-deoxy- - andmethyl l-deoxy-/3-
D-g/uco-heptuloside. l-Deoxy-a-D-g/«co-heptulosyl-(2—*-7)-
heptenitol andl-deoxy-a-D-g/Mco-heptulosyl-(2—1-l)-O-gluco-
heptulose were produced byboth theCandida a-glucosidase
andtheglucodextranase; l-deoxy-a-D-g/uco-heptulosyl-(2—>5)-
and 1-deoxy-a-D-g/u<O-heptulosyl-(2-*7)-D-g/wco-heptuloses
bytherice -glucosidase. These results, together with our
earlier findings ofsterospecific hydration ofheptenitol cata-
lyzed bythe same enzymes [Hehre, E.J.,Brewer, C.F.,
In aprevious report (Hehre etal.,1980), D-glucosyl mobi-
lizing enzymes ofseveral different types were shown tocatalyze
specific hydration reactions with theprochiral glycosyl donor
2.6-anhydro-l-deoxy-D-g/uco-hept-l-enitol (heptenitol).a-
Glucosidases from Candida tropicalis yeast andfrom rice were
found toproduce 1-deoxy-a-D-g/wco-heptulose from this
substrate; the/3-glucosidase from sweet almonds and anin-
verting exo-a-glucanase from Arthrobacter globiformis pro-
duced l-deoxy-/3-D-g/»co-heptulose. Inaddition, both a-glu-
cosidases andtheArthrobacter glucodextranase were observed
tocatalyze theformation ofsaccharide transfer products from
theheptenitol. This paper describes thestructures and modes
offormation ofthese transfer products. Aswill bediscussed,
acomparison oftheresults with those obtained previously for
thehydrations catalyzed bythe same enzymes provides unique
information about thefactors involved indetermining thesteric
course ofenzymic glycosylation reactions. Evidence that
acceptor substrates areamong these factors was reported
earlier (Hehre etal.,1980), onthebasis ofthefinding that
glucodextranase acting onheptenitol leads totheformation
ofan -D-g/uco-heptulosylheptenitol transfer product while
concurrently producing ahydration product ofßconfiguration.
More complete evidence relating tothispoint has now been
obtained.
Traditionally, product configuration hasbeen represented
asbeing rigidly tied tothatofthesubstrate, inthat reactions

Biochemistry 19,3557-3564], show theinadequacy ofthe
long-accepted notion that carbohydrase-catalyzed reactions
always lead toretention (oralways lead toinversion) ofsub-
strate configuration. Inparticular, thefinding that gluco-
dextranase forms transfer products ofaconfiguration and a
hydration product ofßconfiguration from the same substrate
provides aclear example ofthefunctioning ofacceptors rather
than donor substrates inselecting thesteric course ofreactions
catalyzed byaglycosylase. Thecircumstances under which
acceptor cosubstrates might beexpected toshow thissignif-
icant effect arediscussed. Theopportunity presumably would
exist whenever carbonium ionmediated reactions arecatalyzed
byglycosylases that provide oppositely oriented approaches
ofdifferent acceptors tothecatalytic center.
catalyzed byanygiven carbohydrase have been assumed to
either always result inretention oralways result ininversion
ofdonor substrate configuration. Studies with glycosidic
substrates have provided afewcontrary observations (Shibaoka
etal.,1971, 1975; Suetsugu etal.,1971; Pazur etal.,1977,
1978), butthebreakdown ofthislong-accepted generalization
ismost clearly shown intheglycosylation reactions which are
catalyzed byvarious carbohydrases with glycals (Lehmann
&Schróter, 1972; Hehre etal.,1977, 1981; Kanda etal.,
1981) andother enolic glycosyl donors (Brockhaus &Leh-
mann, 1977; Hehre etal.,1980). Such actions donotconform
totheusual notions ofcarbohydrase specificity. Instead, they
support theconcept that glycoside hydrolases andglycosyl-
transferases areglycosylases (Hehre etal.,1971, 1973) that
thus may utilize, asproductive substrates, compounds having
nomore than theability tobind appropriately attheactive
siteand toyieldaglycosyl residue onprotonation. Studies
ofhydration reactions catalyzed bya-and /3-glucosidase with
D-glucal orwith heptenitol (Hehre etal.,1977, 1980) have,
infact, furnished unambiguous evidence fortheability ofthese
glycosylases tocontrol theanomeric configuration ofreaction
products without reference tothat ofthedonor substrate.
Gaining information onhow thiscontrol isachieved isamajor
aimofthisinvestigation ofthestructures ofglycosyl transfer
products synthesized from heptenitol byC.tropicalis a-glu-
cosidase, rice -glucosidase, andglucodextranase. Ineluci-
dation ofthese enzymically produced structures, authentic
 -methyl and /3-methyl l-deoxy-D-g/wco-heptulosides were
employedasreference standards. Routes ofchemical synthesis
ofthese reference heptulosides arereported forthefirst time.

dextranase (Sawai etal.,1976; Ohya etal.,1978), andrice
 -glucosidase (Makor Chemicals Inc., Jerusalem, Israel) were
recovered from replicate 1-mL digests with each enzyme.
Digests with Candida  -glucosidase (C,totaling 16mL)
comprised 270mM substrate (4)and 0.3mg/mL enzyme
buffered with 0.05Macetate atpH5.15; incubation was at
30°Cfor 5h.Glucodextranase digests (GD, 20-mL total)
contained 300mM 4and 1.0mg/mL enzyme atpH5.7;
incubation was at30°Cfor 5h.Rice  -glucosidase digests
(R,30mL) comprised 360mM 4and 1.8mg/mL enzyme
atpH5.5;incubation was at30°Cfor2.25 h.Following
incubation, each 1-mL digest wasapplied asa20-cm band

GD[), Rqlc 0.90 (R2), andRqlc 0.64 (C3, R3,and GD3).
Eluates ofeach product, accumulated from thereplicate di-
gests, were kept at-20°C,protected from moisture. Each
combined eluate wasfinally passed through afinefritted glass
filter, evaporated under vacuum at30°C,anddried under
vacuum from absolute ethanol. Thetransfer products obtained
from digests included thefollowing: with Candida a-gluco-
sidase, Q71mg(8.5% oftheavailable heptenitol substrate)

in1-butanol-ethanol-water (13:8:4 v/v/v). End guide strips
were stained with silver nitrate tolocate thepositions ofthe
D-g/wco-heptulose andofindividual saccharide products, which
were then eluted with methanol. Control chromatograms were
sectioned andeluted atthe same levels asthose ofthetest
digests. Eluates ofsaccharides C,,GD,, C3,R3,GD3, and R2
were treated asfollows. Known portions were dried under
reduced pressure, hydrolyzed in0.025 Nsulfuric acid (100
°C, 10min), neutralized, andanalyzed forreducing power
byacuprimetric method (Hehre etal.,1980) standardized
with l-deoxy-D-g/uco-heptulose. Allvalues were adjusted to
theoriginal digest volume. Inaddition, known portions ofthe
eluates were subjected toscintillation counting, onaBeckmann
LS-230 counter. Allcounts were corrected forbackground
andadjusted totheoriginal digest volume.
Results
Theformation ofsaccharide products aswell as1-deoxy-
D-g/wco-heptulose indigests ofheptenitol with C.tropicalis
and rice  -glucosidases, andwith A.globiformis gluco-
dextranase, wasfirst recognized when stained chromatograms
ineach case showed thepresence ofproducts that migrated
more slowly than theheptulose (7?glc V47). Upon elution
allofthese products were found tobecompletely converted
totheheptulose bymild acid treatment (0.025 Nsulfuric acid,
100°C, 10min). Measurement ofthequantity ofreducing
sugar thus derived from theeluted saccharides was then used
tofind, foreach enzyme, thebest reaction conditions for
recovering these lesser components fordetailed analysis. The
digest conditions andisolation proceduresaregiven under
Experimental Procedures.
Digests ofheptenitol with C.tropicalis  -glucosidase yielded
products C,(71mg) and C3(100 mg), with ricea-glucosidase
R2(98mg) and R3(40mg), andwith glucodextranase GD,
(116 mg) and GD3 (59mg). Preliminary investigations in-
dicated C,andGD, tobeheptulosylheptenitols indistin-
guishable from each other inchromatographic mobility (7?Glc
1.26) and inshowing <5% ofthereducing power of1-
deoxy-D-g/uco-heptulose (Hehre etal.,1980) andinfrared
absorption (>C=CH2 band at1660 cm™1), indicative ofan
intact heptenitol moiety.2 Ontheother hand, R2, C3,R3,and
2The presence ofaheptenitol terminal was also indicated bythe
observation that C,andGD, were converted bygentle acid treatment
(0.01 Nsulfuric acid, 40°C, 7min) toasaccharide product with the
same reducing power andchromatographic mobility ( 0   0.61) asthose
ofC3and GD3.

suggest thatallofthesaccharides recovered from thedigests

The second method used todetermine theconfiguration of
theglycosidically linked residue oftheenzymically formed

their acetylated derivatives 1,2,and 3with thespectra of
authentic reference compounds ofknown anomeric configu-

O-acetate (5).

Mode ofFormation ofSaccharides. Experimentswere
carried outtolearn whether thesaccharides produced inen-
zymic digests ofheptenitol arise directly from thelatter as
glycosyl donor orareformed indirectly from itshydration
product (heptulose) byreactions representing reversals of
hydrolysis. Mixtures ofCandida  -glucosidase, ricea-glu-
cosidase, orglucodextranase, corresponding tothose yielding
saccharide products from heptenitol, gave nosignofsuch
products when examined chromatographically. Further ex-
periments were made with paired mixtures containing hep-
tenitol andenzyme (orboiled enzyme) intheconcentrations
used inisolating thesaccharides, plus1-deoxy-D-g/wco- [1-
3H]heptulose atone-tenth theconcentration oftheheptenitol.After incubation, themixtures were chromatographed, and
identical sections ofthetest andcontrol chromatograms,
corresponding toheptulose andtoeach saccharide evident in
stained guide strips oftheformer, were eluted. The heptulose
content (following mild acid hydrolysis inthe case ofthe
saccharides) andradioactivity ofeach product were measured.
Asshown inTable IV,theheptulose recovered from the
mixtures with boiled enzyme showed aspecific activity of
170-180 cpm/Vg; heptulose from thetestmixtures hadlower
activity (46-64 cpm/#tg) duetodilution with thesugar formed
bytheenzymic hydration oftheunlabeled heptenitol. The
very lowspecific activities ofCjandGD, indicate that these
products arise primarily bythetransfer oftheheptulosyl
moiety from oneheptenitol molecule toanother. Similarly,
theradioactivities found forC3,R3,GD3, and R2allfallwithin
therange expected ifthese heptulosylheptuloseswere produced
byheptulosyl transfer from theunlabeled heptenitol toa
molecule of[1-3H] heptulose. Although thefindings donot
exclude thepresence ofsome proportion ofheptulosylheptulose
labeled inboth moieties asexpected forcondensation products,
they doindicate that theobserved saccharides areprimarily
glycosyl transfer products with heptenitol asthedonor.3
Discussion
l-Deoxy-a-D-g/wco-heptulosyl transfer productswere shown
tobeformed from 2,6-anhydro-1 -deoxy-D-g/uco-hept-1 -enitol
(heptenitol) bypurified  -glucosidases ofC.tropicalis andrice
andbyaninverting exo-a-glucanase (glucodextranase) from
Arthrobacter globiformis. These results, coupled with our
previous findings ofstereospecific hydration ofheptenitol by
the same enzymes (Hehre etal.,1980) provide new insight
into thecatalytic capabilities ofeach andinto thefactors
involved indetermining thesteric course ofthereactions they
catalyze. The occurrence ofproductive glycosylation reactions
with heptenitol is,byitself, highly significant inthatitcon-
tradicts thetraditional assumption that carbohydrases have
anabsolute requirement forsubstrates ofonlya-(oronly ß-)
anomeric configuration. The reactions with heptenitol,aswith
theenzymic utilization ofother prochiral glycosyl donors
(Lehmann &Schroter, 1972; Brockhaus &Lehmann, 1977;
Hehre etal.,1977, 1981; Kanda etal.,1981), show thegreater
generality ofadifferent concept ofcarbohydrase action that

order toundergo sosimple achemical change, adonor sub-
strate would need nomore than theability tobind appro-
priately atanactive siteand toyield aglycosyl residue on

Onthebasis ofthestereochemical nature oftheproducts
formed from heptenitol bytheactions ofCandida andrice
 -glucosidases, andofglucodextranase, possible mechanisms
forthehydration andglycosyl transfer reactions catalyzed by
theenzymes areshown inScheme I.We assume thecatalytic
functions ofeach enzyme tobeserved bytwosuitably disposed
functional groups, possibly carboxyl groups, attheactive
center. One group would serve asaspecificorgeneral acid
while theother, asacarboxylate anion, could act asa
charge-stabilizing group ornucleophilic-specific base. Hep-
tenitol (as aglycosyl donor) isenvisioned asbinding atthe
active sitewith itsexocyclic enolic bond positioned between
these groups. Thefirst stepineither hydrationorglycosyl
transfer byeach enzyme (Scheme I)would involve protonation
ofthevinylic double bond andformation ofatransient glycosyl
carbonium ion-enzyme complex. Protonation byeach enzyme
could arise, asillustrated, from the same carboxyl group that
protonates theglycosidic oxygen atom of -D-glucosidic sub-
strates. Thepossibility cannot beexcluded that theopposite
catalytic group may betheprotonating source, asfound inthe
Candida  -glucosidase-catalyzed hydration ofD-glucal (Hehre
etal.,1977) andintheglucodextranase-catalyzed utilization
of/3-D-glucosyl fluoride (Kitahata etal.,1981). However, H.
Fritz etal.(unpublished results) have recently found that in
thed-galactosidase-catalyzed utilization ofaCgD-gaiacto-enitol, which resembles heptenitol inpossessing anexocyclic
double bond [butwith aprochiral =C(CH3)D group inplace
ofthesymmetric =CH2 ofheptenitol], thedirection ofpro-
tonation isopposite that found with D-galactal (Lehmann &
Zieger, 1977) andthus isthe same asthedirection ofpro-
tonation for0-D-galactosides.

Breakdown oftheheptulose-enzyme complex inboth hydra-

ofthecarboxyl groups, tocreate aproduct ofaconfiguration
ineach case. This mechanism isconsistent with theobserved
formation ofl-deoxy-a-D-g/wco-heptulose byboth Candida

gluco-heptulose (GD3) transfer products. The occurrence of
these stereocomplementary andessentially irreversible reactions
isstrong evidence that thecatalytic groups ofglucodextranase
arefunctionally flexible beyond therequirements ofthe
principle ofmicroscopic reversibility. Such functional flexi-
bility, envisioned byHehre etal.(1979) asanattribute ofthe
catalytic groups ofglycosylases ingeneral, has, bynow, been
shown with avariety ofglycosidases andglycanases (Rupley
etal.,1969; Lehmann &Zieger, 1977; Hehre etal.,1977,
1979, 1980, 1981; Kitahata etal.,1981; Kanda etal.,1981).
Theability ofglucodextranase tocatalyze theformation of
both 1-deoxy-|S-D-g/Mco-heptulosyl and 1-deoxy-a-D-gluco-
heptulosyl transfer products with heptenitol shows anunder-
lying similarity with therecently discovered ability ofthis
enzyme toproduce /3-o-glucose from  -o-glucosyl fluoride and
 -D-glucosyl transfer products from /3-o-glucosyl fluoride
(Kitahata etal.,1981). Ineach case aproduct ofßconfig-
uration isformed when theacceptor iswater; oneofacon-
figuration when itisbound carbohydrate. This similarity in
endresult, obtained with both chiral andprochiral glycosyl
donors, would indicate that glucodextranase issostructured
astolimit theapproach ofwater andcarbohydrate acceptors
tothecatalytic center from opposing directions, possibly by
means ofaspecific binding siteforwater oriented oppositely
tothatforcarbohydrate acceptors.
With heptenitol asdonor substrate, itisevident that the
presence ofeither typeofacceptor suffices byitself toselect
which oftwosterically different reaction paths will becata-
lyzed bytheenzyme. This result, thedemonstration that
acceptor molecules canfunction assoleexternal determinants
oftheanomeric configuration ofproducts, contradicts the
long-accepted notion that enzymic reaction products always
have the same (oralways have theopposite) configuration as
thedonor substrate. Since thedonor inthis instance isa
prochiral compound, thequestions that arise arewhether it
ispossible foracceptors tohave a“steering role” inreactions
with chiral donor substrates or,more broadly, todefine the
circumstances under which acceptors may have astereose-
lective function. With respect tothefirst question, Pazur et
al.(1977,1978) have shown theability ofanAspergillus niger
glucosyltransferase toconvert maltose (with D-glucose asac-
ceptor) to -D-glucobiosyl transfer products, aswell asto
produce 1,6-anhydro-/3-D-glucose (levoglucosan) from maltose
inareaction inwhich theglyconic D-glucosyl residue ofthe
donor becomes a“self-acceptor”, inabinding siteoriented to
thecatalytic center differently from theusual acceptor sites.
Ontheother hand, itisevident that, under certain circum-
stances, thedonor rather than theacceptor substrate represents
theexternal factor thatlimits thecatalyzed reaction(s) toa
particular steric course. Glucodextranase, forexample, directly
hydrolyzes  -D-glucosyl fluoride toform /3-o-glucose buteffects
reactions leading to -o-glucosyl transfer products when ß-
o-glucosyl fluoride isthedonor substrate (Kitahata etal.,
1981); however, though theappropriate acceptors arepresent,
theenzyme appears unable tocatalyze thedirect hydrolysis
of/3-o-glucosyl fluoride (Kitahata etal.,1981) ortoeffect
glucosyl transfer reactions from  -o-glucosyl fluoride orfrom
dextran (Ohya etal.,1978). Apparently, theconditions re-
quired before acceptors ofdifferent types canlead tosterically
different reactions from agiven donor include notonly some
provision foropposing binding orientations fordifferent ac-
ceptors butalso areaction mechanism allowing product con-
figuration tobedetermined atalast step. The reactions
catalyzed byglucodextranase with heptenitol areeffected by
such amechanism (Scheme IB,C), andlikewise, carboniumionmediation hasbeen proposed forthereactions catalyzed
byA.niger glucosyltransferase with maltose (Pazur etal.,
1978). Incontrast, theglucodextranase-catalyzed reactions
with a-and/3-o-glucosyl fluoride areenvisioned asproceeding
byaconcerted displacement mechanism (Kitahata etal.,
1981). Here, theconfiguration oftheglycosyl donor deter-
mines thesteric course ofanyreaction thatmight becatalyzed
with that donor.
Itistobenoted that, byvirtue ofitscatalytic group flex-
ibility, glucodextranase hastheability topromote reactions
with different substrates bydifferent mechanisms. Aclose
parallel isfound inthe caseofsweet potato /3-amylase, which
catalyzes reactions with a-and/3-maltosyl fluoride that appear
toproceed byaconcerted displacement mechanism (Hehre
etal.,1979); butalso reactions with maltal (Hehre etal.,1981)
andmaltenitol (M.Gábelein etal.,unpublished results) that
appear tobecarbonium ionmediated. Theutilization of
different glycosidic substrates bydifferent mechanisms also
hasbeen reported forhen’s egglysozyme acting onvarious
para-substituted di-iV-acetyl-/3-chitobiosides (Tsai etal.,1969)
andforBacillus subtilis  -amylase acting onvarious para-
substituted phenyl  -maltosides (Shibaoka etal.,1971; Sue-
tsugu etal.,1971). The present findings thus provide further
support fortheview (Kitahata etal.,1981) emphasizing that
aglycosylase may actbymore than onemechanism andthat,
although ithasbeen customary tospeak of“the mechanism”
ofaglycosylase, thelatter appears tobeatoo narrow sim-
plification.

Kinetics ofCytochrome bOxidation inAntimycin-Trented
Submitochondrial Particlest
Youssef Hatefi* andTakao Yagi
abstract: Ithasbeen shown that inbovine heart submito-
chondrial particles, antimycin and2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline
fV-oxide (HQNO) inhibit theoxidation ofNADH, succinate,
and reduced ubiquinone incompletely, theuninhibited rate
being about 20-40 nmol ofsubstrate oxidized min"1 (mgof
protein)"1. Bycontrast, rotenone, cyanide, BAL (2,3-di-
mercaptopropanol), and 5-z/-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxo-
benzothiazole [Trumpower, B.L.,&Haggerty, J.G.(1980)
J.Bioenerg. Biomembr. 12,151-164] caused essentially
complete inhibition when added alone orafter maximal in-
hibition byantimycin orHQNO. Having thus ascertained
that theelectron leakthrough theantimycin block appeared
tofollow thenormal path through complex III(ubiquinol:
cytochromecoxidoreductase) andcytochrome oxidase, the
reduction ofthe bcytochromes bysubstrates andtheir oxi-
dation through theleak intheantimycin block bymolecular
oxygen were studied. Itwas shown that atnormal electron
fluxfrom NADH andsuccinate, both cytochromes ¿562and
¿566 were reduced inantimycin-treated submitochondrialparticles. Their oxidation after substrate exhaustion was
biphasic, however. At565minus 575nm, 56%ofthetotal
reduced cytochrome bwasoxidized through theleak inthe
antimycin block atamore rapid rate, while theremaining 44%
wasoxidized about 10times slower. When electron fluxfrom
substrates tocomplex III was slowed down bythe useof
inhibitors orsubstrates at<0.1Km concentration, then only
reduced¿562accumulated inantimycin-treated particles. The
oxidation of¿562after substrate exhaustion orinhibition of
substrate oxidation byanappropriate inhibitor occurred ata
rate comparable tothatoftheslower reoxidation phase de-
scribed above. These results indicated, therefore, that cyto-
chromes¿566 and¿562 areoxidized through theleak inthe
antimycin block attwodifferent rates, thereoxidation rate
of¿566 being about 10times faster than thatof¿562. The
implications ofthese findings onthekinetic relationship of
these twocytochromes intherespiratory chain have been
discussed.
eelectron transport system ofbovine heart mitochondria
contains three spectroscopically distinct bcytochromes (Davis
etal.,1973). Alowpotential cytochrome b(b}60) fractionates
intothesuccinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex
II). This cytochrome has been purified inapreparation
composed oftwopolypeptides ofM,13500and 15000(Hatefi
&Galante, 1980). Theroleofcytochrome b560 isnotclear,
even though thepurified preparation hasbeen shown tore-
combine ina1:1molar ratio with succinate dehydrogenase
andreconstitute ahighly active succinate:ubiquinone oxido-
reductase system (Hatefi &Galante, 1980). Inaddition, it
hasbeen shown that incomplex IIdithionite-reduced¿560 is
rapidly oxidized byfumarate viasuccinate dehydrogenase or
byubiquinone. Theother two bcytochromes (¿562 and b¡66)
occur intheubiquinohcytochromecoxidoreductase complex

substrates tocytochromes c,+c,theprecise roles ofcyto-
chromes¿562and¿566inelectron transfer through complex III
arenotclear either. Cytochrome ¿562 isreduced when sub-
mitochondrial particles aretreated with substrates, and is
oxidized when thereduced particles aretreated with oxygen.
Reduction ofb566 isnotobserved under these conditions and
requires treatment oftheparticles with antimycin, which
creates anoxidation-reduction “crossover” between theband
the ccytochromes. Even inthepresence ofantimycin, the
reduction ofb566bysubstrates requires that cytochromes c,
