A Gram-negative rod tentatively identified as an Agrobacterium sp. was isolated 
from activated sludge with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with a degree of 
substitution as the of 0.6 sole carbon and energy source. Not only did CMC DS 
(degree of substitution) 0.60 support the growth of this strain but also CMC DS 
0.75, CMC DS 1.12, glucose and cellobiose. Agrobacterium CM-l did not utilize 
cellulose. The metabolism of CMC is initiated by hydrolytic reactions catalysed 
by free and cell-bound endoglucanases. CMCs are only partially degraded by 
Agrobacterium CM-l. The extent of biodegradation of CMC DS 0.60, CMC DS 
0.75 and CMC DS 1.12 determined in chemostat cultures increased with 
decreasing DS. The monomer compositions of CMCs and their biodegradation 
products revealed that only glucose and, remarkably, monosubstituted 6-glucose 
units are mineralized. As a consequence biodegradation of CMC by Agrobacter- 
ium CM-I results in the formation of carboxymethylated oligomers with DS 
values greater than those of the original CMC. The DS of the original CMC also 
determined the chain length of the resulting oligomers. 
INTRODUCTION 
Water-soluble polymers can be divided into three 
groups: natural, synthetic and semisynthetic like cellu- 
lose ethers. The cellulose ethers are the most abundant 
of the semisynthetic polymers, with sodium carbox- 
ymethyl cellulose (CMC) as the most important repre- 
sentative. CMC is a colourless-to-cream coloured 
material, produced by the reaction of cellulose hydro- 
xyls with chloroacetate. The average number of hydro- 
xyls in the glucose unit which have reacted is called the 
degree of substitution (DS) and CMCs are categorized 
accordingly (Stelzer & Klug, 1980). Because it is only 
partially carboxymethylated, CMC may be regarded as 
a copolymer of eight monomers: unsubstituted glucose, 
monosubstituted (2-, 3- and 6-), disubstituted (2,3-, 2,6- 
and 3,6-) and trisubstituted (2, 3, 6-) glucose (Reuben, 
1986). 
CMC, a protective colloid, emulsifying and binding 
agent, is used in many fields including coatings, 
cosmetics, detergents, foods, textiles, pharmaceuticals 
and the oil industry. Because of the water-solubility of 
the compound, it eventually finds its way into waste 
streams and ultimately into surface water. Therefore, 
*Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. knowledge about the biodegradability of CMC is desir- 
able in order to assess the impact on the environment. 
The initial biodegradation of CMC probably involves 
the enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages by 
cellulases (Batelaan et al., 1992). The enzyme system can 
be roughly subdivided into three enzyme groups: P-D- 
glucosidases or cellobiases (EC 3.2.1.21) cellobiohy- 
drolases or exoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.91) and 1,4-D- 
glucanohydrolases or endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4). /3- 
Glucosidases hydrolyse cellobiose and some soluble 
cello-oligosaccharides to give glucose. Exoglucanases 
release terminal cellobioses from the non-reducing end 
of the cellulose chain and are active on the crystalline 
parts whereas the endoglucanases hydrolyse amorphous 
cellulose randomly to give glucose, cellobiose and cello- 
dextrins (Beguin & Aubert, 1994; Wood & Garcia- 
Campayo, 1994). 
The carboxymethylation of cellulose makes the mate- 
rial soluble in water. Carboxymethylation influences the 
mode of action of cellulases, enabling only endogluca- 
nases to act on the CMC chain. The degree of substitu- 
tion is the predominant parameter governing the 
enzyme reaction, whereas the degree of polymerization 
of the cellulose derivatives does not significantly affect 
enzymatic hydrolysis. The presence of one carbox- 
ymethyl group on each glucose unit makes the molecule 
137 
138 C.H.N. Sieger et al. 
completely resistant to enzymatic attack (Reese et al., 
1950; Reese, 1957; Wirick, ,196s). Wirick (1968) found 
that enzyme-induced chain scission occurred only at 
sites with three or more adjacent unsubstituted glucose 
units. Kalsulke et al. (1988) extended this finding by 
demonstrating the enzyme attack takes place at sequen- 
ces of three or more unsubstituted glucose units, leaving 
CMC chains ending with unsubstituted glucose units. 
All these investigations are based on work with 
partially purified cellulases usually derived from fungi. 
The purpose of this study was to elucidate a possible 
mechanism of CMC breakdown by isolated bacteria. To 
this end a bacterium capable of degrading CMC was 
isolated and characterized, and the initial biodegrada- 
tion of CMCs varying in degree of substitution was 
studied. Finally, an attempt was made to correlate the 
extent of CMC biodegradation by the isolated bacter- 
ium with the theoretically calculated frequencies and 
distribution of substituted and unsubstituted glucose 
units. fers in fresh medium, serial dilutions of the enrichment 
culture were streaked onto agar plates. One strain was 
isolated from the agar plates. The bacterium was routi- 
nely grown in chemostats (Applikon, Schiedam, The 
Netherlands). The chemostat cultures were supplied 
with mineral salts medium to which CMC DS 0.60, 
CMC DS 0.75 or CMC DS 1.12 had been added at a 
dilution rate of 0.04 h-‘. The temperature was main- 
tained at 30°C. 
Bacterial characterization 
The bacterium was characterized by Gram staining and 
by determining the biochemical properties using a 
commercially taxonomic kit, API NE 20 (Biomerieux, 
Marcy-l’Etoile, France). 
Growth experiments 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Chemicals 
CMC DS 1.12, 0.75 and 0.60 were supplied by Akzo 
Nobel Functional Chemicals, Amersfoort, The Nether- 
lands. The other chemicals were obtained from Janssen 
Chimica, Beerse, Belgium and Sigma Chemical Co., St. 
Louis, USA. The ability of the isolated strain to utilize various 
substrates for growth was tested in lOOm1 Erlenmeyer 
flasks containing 20ml of mineral salt medium with 
growth substrate. After inoculation, the Erlenmeyer 
flasks were incubated for 20 days at 30°C. Growth was 
determined visually by comparing the increase of 
turbidity of the cultures with a control without 
substrate. Growth rates of the isolated strain at 30°C 
were determined by following the increase of turbidity 
using a nephelometer (Hach, Loveland, USA). 
Preparation of washed cell suspension and supernatant 
Crystalline cellulose (ex Sigma) was swollen in 10% 
NaOH in water for 5 h. Next the water was partially 
removed using a Biichner funnel. The residue in the 
funnel was suspended in 200 ml of 10% H2S04 and 
neutralized. Finally, the resulting product was filtered 
through a 12-pm paper filter. The isolated bacterium was grown on CMC DS 0.60 
and glucose. Cells were harvested in the exponential 
growth phase by centrifugation (Suprafuge 22, Heraeus 
Sepatech GmbH, Osterode, Germany) at 10,OOOg at 
4°C for 15 min, washed with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 
50mM) and suspended in the same buffer. 
Growth media, isolation and maintenance of the 
bacterium Oxygen uptake experiments 
The liquid mineral salt medium contained per litre of 
deionized water: 0.85g of NaH2P04.2H20, 1.55g of 
K2HP04, 0.5 g of NH&l, 0.1 g of MgS04.7H20, 0.01 g 
of FeS04.7H20, 0.01 g of CaC12.2H20, 0.01 g of NaED- 
TA.2H20, and 0.1 ml of a trace element solution (Vish- 
niac & Santer, 1957). All growth media were prepared by 
adding 1 g 1-l growth substrate to the mineral salt 
medium with the exception of the CMCs (0.4 g I-‘). Agar 
plates were prepared by the addition of 4gl-’ of CMC 
DS 0.6 and 15 g I-’ of agar to the above mineral salt 
medium. The ph of the medium was approximately 7.0. The oxygen uptake rates of washed cell suspensions 
were measured using a biological oxygen monitor 
(Yellow Springs Instruments Inc, Yellow Springs, USA) 
equipped with an oxygen electrode. Endogenous oxygen 
uptake by washed cells (total volume, 5 ml) was 
measured for 5 min at 30°C. Subsequently 100~1 of a 
substrate solution (1 gll’) was added and the substrate- 
dependent respiration was monitored for at least 5 min. 
Enzymatic assays 
Isolation of CMC-degrading bacteria was carried out Endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4), exoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.91) 
by aerobically incubating activated sludge obtained and /3-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) activities were 
from a plant treating domestic waste water in liquid measured in both supernatant and pellet from a culture 
mineral salts media containing CMC DS 0.60 as sole grown on 4gll’ of CMC DS 0.60. A portion (20ml) of 
carbon and energy source. After three successive trans- the culture was centrifuged (15 min, lO,OOOg, 4°C) after 
Biodegradation of carboxymethyl celluloses 139 
which the pellet was suspended in 20ml of phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mM). 
Endoglucanase activity was determined by measuring 
reducing sugars from the hydrolysis of 1 ml of 0.5% 
CMC DS 0.60 solution. A quantity of 0.02% sodium 
azide was added as a preservative to inhibit the utiliza- 
tion of sugars released by endoglucanase activity. 
Portions (1 ml) of the resuspended pellet were incubated 
at 30°C for 1 h. After the incubation period the reaction 
was stopped by placing the mixture tubes in ice water. 
The amount of reducing sugars was determined using 
the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method of Miller (1959). 
The enzyme activities in the supernatant were deter- 
mined in the same way. 
Exoglucanase and p-glucosidase activity were deter- 
mined according to the method of Deshpande et al. 
(1984) with some modifications. p-Nitrophenyl$-D- 
cellobioside (pNPC) and p-nitrophenyl-p-D-glucopyr- 
anoside (pNPG) were employed for the determination 
of exoglucanase and /$glucosidase activity, respectively. 
The assay mixtures contained 0.9 mg ml-’ of pNPC or 
pNPG in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 50mM) and 0.2 ml 
of culture fluid in a total volume of 2ml. Exoglucanase 
activity was determined in the presence of D-glUCOnO- 
1.5~&lactone (0.5 mg mll’) to inhibit /?-glucosidase 
activity. Incubation conditions were the same as descri- 
bed above. The amounts of p-nitrophenol released were 
calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of 
18.5 ml pmoll’cm-’ for p-nitrophenol at 410 nm. 
Preparation of degradation products 
The extent as well as the mode of biodegradation of 
CMC was determined by analysing the original CMCs 
and the biodegradation products formed in chemostat 
cultures. To prepare the degradation products for 
analysis, 21 of effluent of the chemostat cultures were 
collected and centrifuged (15 min, lO,OOOg, 4°C). Next 
the supernatant was concentrated by evaporation using 
a Rotavap (Heidolph, model W2000) and finally the 
product was freeze-dried (Virtis Company, New York, 
USA). 
Analyses 
The non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC) contents of 
the influent and effluent of the chemostat cultures were 
determined using a Dohrmann DC-190 TOC apparatus 
(Rosemount Analytical Inc., Santa Clara, USA). Prior 
to injection all samples were acidified to enable removal 
of carbon dioxide by purging. 
Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis was used 
to determine the substituent distribution in CMCs and 
their biodegradation products. The samples were 
methanolysed in an acidified methanol solution. During 
the methanolysis the B- 1 ,Cglucosidic linkages were 
broken, resulting in a mixture of carboxymethylated glucose residues and glucose. GLC analyses were 
carried out on a Perkin-Elmer Model 8410 gas chroma- 
tograph equipped with an SE-30 bounded-phase, fused 
silica capillary column (25 m x 0.32 mm I.D. Pierce) and 
a flame ionization detector connected to a Shimadzu C- 
R3A integrator. The temperature of the column was set 
from 150 to 250”~ with an increase of 4°C min-‘, and 
kept at 250°C for 5min. 
High-performance size exclusion chromatography 
(HPSEC) was used to determine the relative molecular 
weight distribution of CMC. Prior to analysis the CMC 
samples were dissolved in 0.2 M ammonium acetate and 
filtered (Spartan 30/B, 0.45pm, Schleicher & Schtill). 
HPSEC was performed on an ultrahydrogel linear 
column (300 x 7.8mm, Waters) with a flow rate of 
0.7 ml min-’ The eluent was monitored with a Waters 
411 refractive index (RF: 32 x 20) detector. The 
temperature of the column was 30°C and the running 
time was 45min. The amount of cell protein in the cell 
suspensions was determined using the bicinchoninic acid 
method, with serum albumin as a standard (Pierce, 
Rockford, USA). 
RESULTS 
Isolation and characterization 
CMC-degrading bacteria were enriched from secondary 
activated sludge of a sewage plant treating predomi- 
nantly domestic waste water. Serial dilutions of the 
enrichment culture were streaked onto CMC plates. A 
colony excessively present was isolated and designated 
as CM-l. Strain CM-l was a Gram-negative motile rod, 
which formed round, slimy cream-coloured colonies 
when plated on solidified medium containing 1 gl-’ of 
glucose. The strain was able to oxidize cytochrome c, to 
reduce nitrates, to hydrolyse aesculin and p-nitrophenyl- 
fl-D-galactopyranoside (PNGP), but not gelatin. It 
produced neither indole, arginine dihydrolase nor acid 
from glucose. Strain CM-l assimilated arabinose, 
mannose, mannitol, N-acetylglucosamine, citrate, 
phenylacetate, adipate, caprate, acetate, lactose, 
maltose, mannose, and starch. On the basis of the above 
characteristics the organism was tentatively classilied as 
an Agrobacterium sp. 
Growth and whole cell studies 
CMC DS 0.60, CMC DS 0.75 and CMC DS 1.12 serve 
as growth substrates for Agrobacterium CM-l. The 
doubling time on CMC DS 0.60 amounts to approxi- 
mately 4h. Other cellulose ethers i.e. hydro- 
xyethylcellulose MC 1.2 DS 0.9 and methylcellulose DS 
0.9 also support growth but celluloses, i.e. Avicel and 
Sigmacell type 100 did not. Moreover, no growth was 
observed on cellulose pretreated with NaOH to improve 
140 C.H.N. Sieger et al. 
the bioavailability. The strain was capable of growing 
on glucose and cellobiose. The generation time on 
glucose and cellobiose is 1.5 h. 
In addition, the respiration by strain CM-l pregrown 
on glucose and on CMC DS 0.60 was measured. 
Comparing the oxygen uptake it is clear that CM-l 
pregrown on glucose medium is not able to respire 
CMCs (Table 1). The oxygen uptake of substituted 
glucose was not tested because such compounds were 
not available. 
Chemostats were supplied with influent containing 
CMCs with different DS. The NPOC concentration of 
the influent and steady-state effluent of the chemostat 
cultures and the calculated removal percentages are 
presented in Table 2. Biodegradation expressed as 
removal percentage decreases with increasing DS. 
Exoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.91), endoglucanases 
(EC 3.2.1.4) and fi-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.4) 
The inability of the isolated bacterium to grow on 
cellulose may be explained by the lack of exogluca- 
nases. Indeed, no exoglucanase activity was observed. 
Subsequently, the assumption that biodegradation of 
CMC proceeded by an initial hydrolytic reaction cata- 
lysed by endoglucanases was investigated. Endogluca- 
nases are extracellular enzymes either bound or free 
(Wood & Garcia-Campayo, 1994). At least part of the 
endoglucanases are anchored to the cell surface 
because a washed cell suspension of CMC-grown 
bacteria was capable of oxidizing CMC (Table 1). 
Therefore the endoglucanase production by Agro- 
bacterium CM-l growing on CMC DS 0.60 in a batch 
culture was measured in supernatant and pellet 
cultures. The total endoglucanase activity which 
increased during growth, was distributed over the 
pellet and the supernatant of the culture. During 
growth of Agrobacterium CM-l in the batch culture 
70-80% of the endoglucanase activity was found in 
the pellet (Fig. 1). The endoglucanase activity of the 
pellet was approximately 20pmol glucose mg cell 
protein-’ h-’ . 
The utilization of cellobiose for growth suggested 
P-glucosidase activity. /I-glucosidase activity was detec- 
ted using p-nitrophenol-/I-D-glucopyranoside as 
substrate. The estimated a-glucosidase activity of the Table 1. Rates of oxygen uptake by washed cell suspeusious of

Identification of the degradation products 
Glucose and cellobiose released by endoglucanase 
activity are metabolized by Agrobacterium CM-l (Table 
1). The utilization of these carbohydrates probably 
results in the formation of carboxymethylated oligo- 
mers. This assumption agrees with the incomplete 
biodegradation of CMCs in the chemostate cultures 
(Table 2). To study and identify these oligomers, CMC 
DS 0.60, CMC DS 0.75 and CMC DS 1.12 were degra- 
ded in chemostat cultures. The CMCs and their degra- 
dation products were characterized using gas-liquid 
chromatography (GLC) and high-performance size 
exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The DS of the 
CMC before and after subjection to biodegradation was 
calculated using the measured monomer composition. 
Biodegradation of CMC resulted in an increase of the 
DS (Table 2). 
Assuming that the di- and tricarboxymethylated 
glucose units are resistant to biodegradation, degrada- 
tion of glucose and monosubstituted glucose can be 
estimated with the di- and trisubstituted glucoses as 
internal standard. The biodegradation of glucose and 
monosubstituted glucoses expressed in percentages is 
shown in Table 3. Although primarily glucose was 
utilized during the biodegradation of CMCs, it is clear 
that also monosubstituted 6-glucose units were utilized 
by Agrobacterium CM-l. 12 and 15% of the carbon 
removed by biodegradation in the chemostats fed with 
CMC DS 0.60 and CMC DS 0.75, respectively, is 
derived from the monosubstituted 6-glucose units. The 
calculated biodegradation percentages of all CMCs are

In order to investigate the depolymerization of the 
CMCs by Agrobacterium CM-l, the elution patterns 
and the average molecular number (Mn) of the degra- 
dation products were determined. The CMCs used as 
substrate have the same degree of polymerization. The 
elution patterns of the degradation products show that 
with decreasing DS the average elution time substan- 
tially increases. Absolute average molecular weights 
cannot be estimated because the hydrodynamic volume 
of the anionic CMC is not equal to the cello-oligomers 
and the dextran standard used in the calibration plot 
(Hamacher & Sahm, 1985). However, an estimate of 
the ratio of the number of chain scissions can be 
made:

The polymer chain lengths of the degradation 
products demonstrate that cleavage by Agrobacterium 
CM-l was less effective at higher DS values leaving 
fragments with a higher degree of polymerization. This 
is consistent with the results found in the carbon and 
GLC analyses.

DISCUSSION 
Agrobacterium CM-l used in this study was isolated 
with CMC DS 0.6 as sole carbon and energy source 
from sludge taken from a plant treating domestic waste 
water. Agrobacterium CM-l was chosen because it was 
excessively present in the enrichment culture. The 
growth rate of the bacterium on CMC DS 0.6 and 
glucose is 0.2 and 0.5 h-’ , respectively. Comparing these 
generation times, it is conceivable that the liberation of 
carbohydrates is the rate limiting step in the biode- 
gradation of CMC. Oxygen uptake rates monitored for 
glucose and cellobiose (Table 1) demonstrate, as postu- 
lated by Bhattacharjee & Perlin (1971), that these 
compounds are utilized as carbon and energy sources 
during growth on CMC. 
Agrobacterium CM-l cannot grow on cellulose. The 
absence of exoglucanase activity accounts for the 
inability to grow on cellulose. This is consistent with 
other observations because most bacteria producing 
cellulases appear to release only endoglucanases which 
show little activity to crystalline cellulose (Wood & 
Garcia-Campayo, 1994). 
Biodegradation of CMCs by strain CM-l is initiated 
through hydrolysis catalysed by endoglucanases exist- 
ing in bound and in free form (Fig. 1). The endogluca- 
nases involved in the hydrolysis of CMCs are inducible 
because washed cell suspensions of glucose-grown 
Agvobacterium CM-l do not respire CMCs. Finally, 
only bound a-glucosidase was detected. Wood & 
Garcia-Campayo (1994) stated that there may be 
certain situations where cell-bound enzymes will be 
more efficient in the degradation of macromolecules. 
This includes the situation where the microorganisms 
are in an aquatic environment such as waste water 
treatment plants. Biodegradation of the CMCs in 
chemostat cultures was followed by determining the 
NPOC content of the influent and the effluent. All 
CMCs are partially degraded and the extent of biode- 
gradation of the CMCs depends upon the DS of these 
substrates. The polymer stability increases with 
increasing DS. This relationship was also established in 
previous studies with fungal cellulases (Philip & 
Stscherbina, 1992). 
To identify the organic carbon in the effluent of the 
chemostat cultures, the monomer composition and the 
substituent distribution over the monomeric units of the 
degradation products were determined using GLC 
analysis. The DS of the biodegradation products of the 
CMCs is greater than the original CMCs (Table 2). The 
extent of biodegradation of CMC reflects the degrada- 
tion of glucose and monosubstituted 6-glucose units, 
resulting in an increase of the DS. The carbox- 
ymethylated oligomers formed vary in the degree of 
polymerization due to biodegradation of varying 
amounts of glucose and monosubstituted 6-glucose 
(Table 3). An explanation of the mode of biodegradation of 
CMC by Agrobacterium CM-l may be obtained by 
correlating the measured amount of unsubstituted 
glucose units with a statistical analysis. If a random 
distribution is assumed for the unsubstituted glucose 
units in CMC, it is possible to predict the probable 
frequency of two or more adjacent unsubstituted 
glucose units. In studies with fungal cellulases the 
probability of three adjacent unsubstituted glucose 
units is an indication of the extent of hydrolysis of 
CMC (Wirick, 1968). In view of this, Kalsulke et al. 
(1988) developed a model to predict the release of 
unsubstituted glucose. The release of unsubstituted 
glucose was predicted by assuming that the enzyme 
attack takes place at sequences of three or more 
unsubstituted glucose units, leaving CMC chains 
ending with unsubstituted glucose units. The predicted 
release of unsubstituted glucose from the CMC samples 
is compared with the measured degradation percen- 
tages. It is obvious that the former are much too low. 
However, not only unsubstituted glucose units were 
degraded but also monosubstituted 6-glucose units 
(Table 3). On the basis of the assumption that all 
monosubstituted 6-glucose units are viewed as unsub- 
stituted glucose by exoglucanases, the release of 
unsubstituted glucose and monosubstituted 6-glucose 
can be predicted using the model developed by 
Kalsulke et al. (1988). Although the predicted releases 
of CMC DS 0.75 and CMC DS 1.12 are similar to those 
actually found, this mode of attack is not valid because 
a much higher release is predicted for CMC DS 0.60 
than actually measured (Table 4). The mode of biode- 
gradation by Agrobacterium CM-l cannot be predicted 
using the model developed by Kalsulke et al. (1988). It 
appears that for the liberation of glucose and mono- 
substituted 6-glucose, the presence of special groupings 
is required. 
Although carboxymethylated oligomers persist in 
pure cultures of Agrobacterium CM-l, these 
compounds are subject to biodegradation by other 
microorganisms. A high biodegradation percentage 
achieved in a prolonged Closed Bottle test suggests 
complete mineralization of CMC DS 0.7 (van Ginkel 
& Stroo, 1993). In further studies we intend to assess 
the biodegradation of CMC in simulation tests of 
waste water treatment plants and to determine the 
toxicity of CMC and the biodegradation products to 
aquatic organisms.
