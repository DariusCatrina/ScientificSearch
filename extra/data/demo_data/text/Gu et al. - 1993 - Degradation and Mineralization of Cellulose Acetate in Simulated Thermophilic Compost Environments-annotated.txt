Degradation and Mineralization of Cellulose Acetate in 
Simulated Thermophilic Compost Environments* 
Ji-Dong Gu, I'2 I). Eberiel, 3 S. P. McCarthy, 4 and R. A. Gross ~'s 
Residual cellulose acetate (CA) films with initial degree of substitution (DS) values of 1.7 and 
2.5 (CA DS-1.7 and DS-2.5) were recovered from a simulated thermophilic compost exposure 
and characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), proton nuclear magnetic resonance 
(~H NMR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine changes in polymer molecular 
weight and DS and to study microbial colonization and surface morphology, respectively, During 
the aerobic degradation of CA DS-1.7 and CA DS-2.5 films exposed for 7 and I8 days, respec- 
tively, the number-average molecular weight (M~) of residual polymer decreased by 30.4% on 
day 5 and 20.3% on day 16, respectively. Furthermore, a decrease in the degree of substitution 
from 1.69 to 1.27 (4-day exposure) and from 2.51 to 2.18 (12-day exposure) was observed ~br 
the respective CA samples. In contrast, CA films (DS-I.7 and DS-2.5) which were exposed to 
abiotic control vessels for identicaI time periods showed no significant changes in M~ and DS. 
SEM photographs of CA (DS-I.7 and DS-2.5) film surfaces after compost exposures revealed 
severe erosion and corresponding microbial colonization. Similar exposure times for CA films in 
abiotic control vessels resulted in only minor changes in surface characteristics by SEM obser- 
vations. The conversion of CA DS-I.7 and DS-2.5 to CO~ was monitored by respirometry. In 
these studies, powdered CA was placed in a predigested compost matrix which was maintab~ed 
at 53°C and 60% moisture content throughout the incubation period. A lag phase of 10- and 25- 
day duration for CA DS-1.7 and DS-2.5, respectively, was observed, after which the rate of 
degradation increased rapidly. Mineralization of exposed CA DS-I.7 and DS-2.5 powders re- 
ported as the percentage theoretical CO2 recovered reached 72.4 and 77.6% in 24 and 60 days, 
respectively. The results of this study demonstrated that microbial degradation of CA films ex- 
posed to aerobic thermophilic laboratory-scale compost reactors not only results in film weight 
loss but also causes severe film pitting and a corresponding decrease in chain M n and degree of 
substitution for the residual material. Furthermore, conversions to greater than 70% of the theo- 
retical recovered CO2 for CA (DS 1.7 and 2.5) substrates indicate high degrees of CA minerat.- 
ization.

INTRODUCTION 
Polysaccharide esters represent an exciting broad 
class of materials derived from nature. The polysac- 
charide component may be obtained directly from agri- 
cultural products such as corn (starch) and wood (cel- 
lulose). Alternatively, agricultural materials may be used 
in polysaccharide production by microbial fermentation 
or enzyme catalyzed conversion [1, 21]. The ester com- 
ponent of polysaccharide esters can have a highly vari- 
able structure and degree of substitution (DS). Of 
course, this variability in polysaccharide and side-chain 
ester structure and substitution allows the polymer sci- 
entist to tailor the corresponding material properties of 
polysaccharide esters for a number of applications. Cel- 
lulose esters, most notably cellulose acetates (CA), rep- 
resent a subset of polysaccharide esters that are used for 
textile fibers, plastics, film, sheeting, membrane, and 
lacquers [3]. A description of the relationship among 
cellulose ester molecular weight, DSI and structure of 
the side-chain esters to the use of the corresponding ma- 
terials for specific applications was presented elsewhere 
[31. 
Early work which describes investigations of CA 
biodegradability was carried out by Reese [4], who noted 
that approximately half of the cellulolytic organisms in- 
vestigated utilized cellobiose octaacetate as a carbon 
source, but only a few were capable of liberating de- 
tectable amounts of enzymes. Interestingly, the enzyme 
responsible for cellobiose octaacetate deacetylation (cel- 
lobiose octaacetylesterase) not only was produced when 
using cellobiose octaacetate as the substrate, but also 
was formed on water-soluble CA with a DS of 0.76 [4]. 
One fungal species, Pestalotiopsis westerdijkii QM 381 
(formerly Pestalotia palmarum), was particularly useful 
for the formation of an exocellular cellobiose octaace- 
tatease [4]. This microorganism was also found to pro- 
duce this enzyme on water-soluble CA (DS 0.76) and 
the enzyme was less active than on cellobiose octaace- 
rate [4]. Many years later, Downing et al. used P. wes- 
terdijkii to predigest water-soluble CA forming reducing 
sugars and acetate prior to converting these intermediate 
products to ethanol [5]. Reese [4] also exposed cellulose 
triacetate (the exact DS was not reported by the author) 
to a number of microorganisms which degraded both 
celtobiose octaacetate and water-soluble CA and found 
no growth over a 4-week incubation period. It should 
be noted that in this work, no effort was made to isolate 
microorganisms that were capable of degrading CA with 
a DS value higher than 0.76. Furthermore, it was not 
clear whether deacetylation occurred prior to, concur- 
rently with, or after water-soluble CA main chain cleav- age events. However, the work by Reese, carried out 36 
years prior to this publication, surely must be consid- 
ered a pioneering effort that evoked a number of ques- 
tions which were not addressed until recently. 
Interestingly, in birchwood xylan approximately 
70% of the xylose units are acetylated [6]. Therefore, 
in nature there exists a substantially acetylated biode- 
gradable polysaccharide ester. Luthi et al, [7] obtained 
an acetylxylan esterase from Caldocellum sacchardyti- 
cum expressed in Escherichia coli strain RR28 that 
showed no activity on xylan and cleaved acetate from 
acetylated xylan. Unfortunately, these workers did not 
determine the degree of substitution of the acetylated 
xylan which was used in their study. Work by Lee et at. 
[8] showed that the yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa 
produced an acetyl xylan esterase as an exocellular 
product when induced by triacetin. Furthermore, R. mu- 
citaginosa did not produce a xylan-degrading enzyme 
and, thus, was free of xylanotytic activity. The ace- 
tylxylan esterase from R. mucilaginosa did not degrade 
a water-insoluble CA substrate where, once again, the 
DS of the CA was not reported. In contrast to R. mu- 
cilaginosa, the fungus Trichoderma reesi can produce 
two specific and several nonspecific xylanases as well 
as at least two acetyl esterases [9]. This fungus actively 
degrades acetylxylan polymer chains which contain 
10%, by weight, acetyl groups, to produce xylose, ar- 
abinose, xylobiose, and acetate [9]. 
Work in our laboratory has been carried out to in- 
vestigate the biodegradability of CA films with DS val- 
ues of 1.7 and 2.5 (CA DS-1.7 and DS-2.5) when ex- 
posed to biologically active in-laboratory composting 
test vessels maintained at approximately 53 °C [10-14]. 
It was found that the CA DS-1.7 and DS-2.5 films 
(thickness values, - 0.013 to 0.025 and 0.051 ram, re- 
spectively) had completely disappeared (were not vi- 
sually observed in the test waste mixture) by the end of 
7- and 18-day exposure time periods, respectively. Con- 
trol poisoned reactors showed little CA weight loss over 
similar exposure time periods so that it may be con- 
cluded that film erosion during the composting expo- 
sures was due, at least in part, to biologically mediated 
degradative mechanisms. A 30-day exposure of CA DS- 
1.7 film samples (0.013- to 0.025-ram thickness) to an 
anaerobic methanogenic microcosm developed from a 
sludge inoculum resulted in almost-complete weight loss 
of the film, while exposure of these same films in poi- 
soned control vessels resulted in negligible film weight 
loss [t0]. Once again, it appears that CA DS-1.7 is de- 
graded by a process which is biologically mediated. 
Furthermore, we have isolated a number of CA degrad- 
ing pseudomonads [11, 14] and funga! strains [15]. 

Cellulose Acetate Biodegradation 283 
Recently, Buchanan et aI. [16] investigated the 
biodegradation potential of CA using an enrichment cul- 
ture that was initiated with an activated sludge inocu- 
lum. Exposure of CA films and fibers (DS-1.7 and DS- 
2.5) to this enrichment culture resulted in extensive deg- 
radation. Recovered CA DS 2.5 fibers showed a de- 
crease in DS from an initial value of approximately 2.5 
to approximately 2.0 as well as a narrowing of the mo- 
lecular weight distribution Mw/M,. The biodegradability 
of CA DS-1.7 and DS-2.5 was further demonstrated 
using an aerated wastewater treatment basin exposure. 
Moreover, the biodegradability of CA DS-1.6 and DS- 
1.85 by the sludge-derived enrichment culture was in- 
vestigated by exposure of samples which contain ~4C- 
labeled acetyl substituents. Sixty-eight percent recovery 
of the acetyl substituents in the form of CQ was re- 
ported using this approach. The latter experiment is, of 
course, excellent evidence that CA with a DS of 1.85 is 
indeed mineralizable. 
In this paper, changes in the molecular weight, DS, 
and surface colonization of CA DS-1.7 and DS-2.5 films 
which were exposed to laboratory-scale aerobic ther- 
mophilic composting bioreactors are reported. Further- 
more, predigested compost derived from a synthetic 
municipal solid waste mixture without prior exposure to 
polymer was used as a support of microbial growth on 
CA substrates to determine the rate of CO 2 evolution. 
Thus, respirometric studies on CA were carried out by 
placing powdered CA in contact with predigested com- 
post which was maintained at 60% moisture and 53°C. 
The temperature, percentage moisture, and solid sup- 
port used in this study was intended to simulate some 
features of a thermophilic composting system. Thus, CA 
was exposed to thermophitic aerobic simulated compost 
environments to investigate the biodegradation potential 
of this family of polymers. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Degradation Testing in Laboratory-Scale Compost 
Reactors 
CA DS-1.7 films were made by solution casting 
onto Teflon from either acetone-H20 (1 : 1 ratio, v/v; 
17% CA DS-I.7, wt/v) or acetone (15% CA DS-2.5, 
w/v). Powdered CA DS-2.5 and granule (about 2 mm 
in diameter) CA DS-1.7 (Eastman Kodak Company, 
Kingsport, TN) were used to prepare the polymer so- 
lutions. After removal of residual solvent in a vacuum 
oven, the films were aged for at least 2 weeks prior use. 
A simulated in-laboratory compost procedure was 
developed and used to study the degradability of shaped polymeric materials [10]. In this procedure, a synthetic 
municipal solid waste mixture was used that contains 
important components present in the municipal solid 
waste stream and an appropriate chemical composition 
so that an active microbial population proliferates [10]o 
All bioreactors were maintained at 53°C and a 60% 
moisture content and aerated at 100 ml/min. Abiotic m- 
actors were initiated simultaneously to assess whether 
chemical degradation of the polymeric materials occurs 
under the test conditions. A detailed description of the 
bioreactor configuration and the operational procedure 
has been published elsewhere [10]. During the degra- 
dation testing, residual polymer films were recovered 
from the composting and abiotic test vessels at desired 
sampling time intervals. The recovered materials were 
cleaned by immersion in deionized water to remove the 
coarse particles on film surface and gentle blotting with 
70% isopropylalcohot-moistened Kimwipes EX-L 
(Kimberly-Clark, Fisher Scientific, PA), dried in a vac- 
uum oven at 30°C and reduced pressure, and then 
weighed. These films were analyzed for changes in their 
molecular weight, their degree of substitution, and the 
microbial colonization on the polymer surface. 
Characterization of Partially Degraded Polymer 
Films 
Molecular Weight. The molecular weights of CA 
DS-I.7 and DS-2.5 films prior to and after exposure in 
bioreactor and abiotic test vessels were measured by gel 
permeation chromatography (GPC) on a chromato- 
graphic system consisting of a Waters Model 510 pump, 
a Waters Model 410 refractive index detector, and a 
Waters Model 730 data module. Three KD gel columns 
(300 × 8.0 mm, Shodex, Showa Denko, Shoko, Co., 
Japan; particle size, 5 mm; pore size~ 105 and t03 A) 
were placed in series and operated at a flow rate of i.0 
mt/min. The sample concentration was t0 mg/ml and 
the injection volume was 50 ~1. The analysis was per- 
formed using dimethylformamide (DMF; Aldrich Co., 
Milwaukee, WI) containing 0.1% (w/v) LiBr as the 
eluant. Molecular weights were calculated relative to 
polystyrene standards without further corrections. 
Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (Nr'~R) 
The ~H NMR spectra of residual and unexposed 
samples were recorded on a Broker WP-270 SY spec- 
trometer at 270 MHz to determine the polymer DS val- 
ues. The parameters employed were as follows: 1-1.5% 
(w/w.) polymer in d6-DMSO (Aldrich Co.); tempera- 
ture, 80°C; pulse width, 0.5 #s; receiver delay, 2 s; and 

284 Gu, Eberiei, McCarthy, and Gross 
transients, 600-800. The degree of acetylation was de- 
termined according to the procedure of Goodlett et al. 
[17]. Free hydroxyl groups were first completely ace- 
tylated by reaction with d3-acetytchloride at room tem- 
perature for 72 h. The degree of acetylation was ob- 
tained by spectral integration by comparing the ratio of 
the acetyl 1H NMR signals at approximately 2 ppm to 
the multiple backbone signals at between 3.6 and 5.3 
ppm. 
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 
SEM of the polymer films was performed without 
coating the films or any other surface treatment using an 
ISIIC-130 SEM. 
Respirometry Setup 
The respirometric system used in assessing the min- 
eralization of polymer carbon to CO2 consisted of an air 
pump, which served as an air source; an air pretreatment 
system to sterilize, remove CO2, and control the flow 
rate; test vessels which contained predigested compost; 
and post test vessel trapping of the CO 2 produced. The 
predigested compost was obtained by a 42-day matura- 
tion period of a defined synthetic waste mixture [10] and 
was used to supply the indigenous microbial population 
and also to serve as a physiological and nutritional sup- 
port. For each polymer sample analyzed a total of six 
vessels were set up where three vessels were amended 
with 1.0 g of the polymer powder (particle size was be- 
tween 300 and 400 ~m using mesh screens) and the other 
three served as background controls to measure the basal 
CO2 production from the indigenous microbial popula- 
tion. The test vessels were maintained at 53°C and 60% 
moisture throughout the analysis. The difference in CO2 
production between the test vessels with and those with- 
out the polymer sample was attributed to the degrada- 
tion of the polymer sample. Produced CO2 was trapped 
by reaction with a NaOH solution. The amount of NaOH 
left unreacted was quantitated by titration with HC1 to 
pH 9.0 using a Mettter DL 12 (Mettler Instrument Co., 
Hightstown, NJ). A more detailed description of the 
methodology has been published elsewhere [18]. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Characterization of Degraded Films 
Extensive erosion at the surface of CA DS-1.7 films 
was observed by SEM after exposure times of 5 days in the composting reactors. Figure 1 shows SEM photo- 
graphs of CA DS-1.7 after a 5-day compost exposure 
(Fig. la), after a 5-day incubation in an abiotic control 
reactor (Fig. lb) and of an unexposed film (Fig. lc). In 
all of these cases (including the unexposed film) the re- 
covered films were cleaned by immersion in deionized 
water and isopropylalcohol-moistened Kimwipes (see 
Materials and Methods) to remove the adhered particles, 
microbes, and other substances. The comparatively large 
changes in surface morphology seen in Fig. la relative 
to Figs. lb and c are supportive evidence that the deg- 
radation of CA DS-1.7 in composting test vessels is due 
in large part to biomediated processes. This is also in 
agreement with the determination that CA DS-I.7 
showed comparatively little weight loss after an expo- 
sure time of up to 7 days in the abiotic control vessels 
[10]. A similar SEM investigation was conducted for 
exposed and control CA DS-2.5 films. Figure 2 shows 
SEM photographs of CA DS-2.5 after a 15-day compost 
exposure (Fig. 2a) and after a 15-day incubation in an 
abiotic control reactor (Fig. 2b) and of an unexposed 
film (Fig. 2c). These films also were cleaned as above 
to remove microbial and other attachments. Figure 2a 
shows severe surface erosion, whereas Figs. 2b and c 
appear relatively unchanged. This is once again support- 
ive evidence that CA DS-2.5 film erosion and associated 
weight loss [10] observed after compost test exposures 
occur due to biomediated mechanisms. 
SEM photographs were also taken without cleaning 
the surface of CA DS-1.7 and DS-2.5 films after 5- and 
15-day exposure times in the composting test reactors 
(see Figs. ld and 2d, respectively). In this way, micro- 
bial colonization onto the respective film surfaces was 
also observed. The predominant microorganisms colo- 
nized on the CA DS-1.7 film surfaces resemble most 
closely the filamentous actinomyce or hyphal fungus (see 
Fig. ld). In contrast, the most pervasive microorgan- 
isms on the CA DS-2.5 exposed films are most likely 
bacterial species. This suggests that a wide array of mi- 
croorganisms are capable of functioning either alone or 
in combination with other microbes to effect CA bio- 
degradation. Indeed, a number of bacteria and fungi 
species have been isolated in this laboratory for their 
ability to use CA as a sole carbon and energy source 
[14, 15]. 
GPC analyses was carried out on CA samples re- 
covered from composting exposures to determine effects 
on polymer molecular weight (see Materials and Meth- 
ods). Since the molecular weights were determined by 
GPC on CA samples with nonidentical repeat unit com- 
position (see Table I), without correction for polymer

hydrodynamic volume effects, definitive conclusions as 
to molecular weight changes cannot be made herein and 
are considered apparent changes for the present discus- 
sion. The GPC results shown in Table I indicate that the 
M, and M w values for both CA DS-t.7 and CA DS-2.5 decreased significantly for extended composting expo- 
sure times. In contrast, exposures of both CA DS-1.7 
and CA DS-2.5 in poisoned reactors showed no mea- 
surable events of chain cleavage (see Table I). There- 
fore, the CA chain glycosidic linkages show a good sta-

bility to chemical hydrolysis so that the apparent de- 
creases in CA molecular weight are likely due to 
biocatalyzed processes. Molecular weight loss attribut- 
able to bioactivity was also reported by Buchanan et al. 
[16] for exposures of CA DS-2.5 fiber and ground pow- der to an enrichment culture containing a mixed micro- 
bial population. It is also of interest to note that Mw/M n 
values changed little for CA samples which were exten- 
sively eroded. This is explained by the occurrence of 
random endo-cleavage events and/or the production of

low molecular weight degradation products by chain- 
end-cleavage mechanisms that rapidly diffuse away from 
the residual materials. Such low molecular weight prod- 
ucts diffusing from the film are likely rapidly assimi- 
lated by colonizing microorganisms. The DS values ob- 
tained from tH NMR analyses (see Materials and 
Methods) for CA DS-1.7 and DS-2.5 samples which 
were not exposed, exposed to the composting environ- 
ment, and exposed in abiotic control test vessels are 
shown in Table I. It was observed that the DS of re- 
covered CA DS-1.7 and DS-2.5 samples was signifi- 
cantly decreased upon exposures in composting reactors 
(see Table I). However, the measured DS values of the 
CA samples that were exposed for comparatively longer 
time periods in abiotic control test vessels remained 
identical to that of the unexposed samples. This result, 
in combination with the molecular weight measure- 
ments recorded for CA exposed in composting and 
abiotic test vessels, indicates that biological degradation 
of CA is not initiated by initial chemical deacetylation 
or glycosidic bond cleavage. In other words, biological 
mechanisms are responsible for the observed weight loss 
in the composting exposures. 
Mineralization of Cellulose Acetates 
Mineralization of a polymeric material by micro- 
organisms under aerobic conditions produces CO2, H20, 
microbial biomass, and humus. Therefore, a respiro- 
metric technique was used to quantitate the evolved CO2 
due to polymer biodegradation. The method was sum- 
marized above (see Materials and Methods) and was de- 
scribed in detail elsewhere [18]. The low basal level of CO2 production in test vessels which did not contain the 
polymer substrate (approximately 12-15 mg CO2-C per 
day) was found to be linear as a function of time [18] 
and was subtracted from that produced in polymer 
amended vessels to obtain the total CO2 and the corre- 
sponding percentage of the theoretical CO2 formed as a 
result of substrate mineralization (see Figs. 3 and 4). 
Figure 3 shows that exposure of CA DS-1.7 to the pre- 
digested compost matrix produced 72.4% of its theoret- 
ical carbon as CO2 after a total incubation period of 24 
days. In comparison, the total time required for CA DS- 
2.5 to roach the plateau value of 77.6% substrate carbon 
conversion to CO 2 was 60 days (see Fig. 4). Of addi- 
tional interest, the rate of CA DS-1.7 mineralization in- 
creased rapidly after only a 10-day lag period, whereas 
the tag period prior to rapid CA DS-2.5 mineralization 
was considerably longer (approximately 25 days). ]n 
agreement with these results, both the lag period prior 
to film weight loss and the total time for film disap- 
pearance were notably longer for CA DS-2.5 relative to 
CA DS-I.7 (see Ref, 10 and above). Indeed, it is not at 
all surprising that CA of a relatively higher degree of 
substitution shows relatively slower rates of biodegra- 
dation (see discussion below). However, most impor- 
tantly, the results shown in Fig. 4 suggest that CA with 
a degree of acetylation of up to 2.5 is mineralized to a 
high degree under the appropriate environmental expo- 
sure conditions.

merous studies [19]. Xylan is also highly abundant in 
nature and is described as a fi-1,4-1inked D-xylose het- 
eropolymer which can be highly substituted with arabi- 
nosyl, acetyl, uronyl, and arabinose side groups [20]. It 
is well-known that the complete mineralization of cel- 
lulose and naturally acetylated xylan requires the pres- 
ence of multiple enzymes which act in a cooperative 
manner [ 19, 201. 
in the biodegradation of xylan containing side-chain 
acetyl groups, it has been discussed above that deacetyl 
esterases have been identified which function to remove 
side-chain acetyl groups from the polymer chain [20]. 
Furthermore, it has been shown by a number of workers 
that CA polymers which have DS values of more than 
0.76 are not degraded by cellulase enzyme systems [4]. 
From the above, it is highly likely that the biodegrada- 
tion of CA with a DS greater than approximately 0.8 
requires the presence of both deacetylase and cellulase 
enzyme systems. Therefore, it is hypothesized that de- 
acetylase enzymes are required to provide chains or 
chain segments with DS values of less than approxi- 
mately 0.7. Once this critical degree of deacetylation is 
reached, cellulase enzymes cause events of chain cleav- 
age which are accelerated by further chain deacetyla- 
tion. A schematic of this is shown in Figure 5. It should 
be noted that the critical value of deacetylation required 
~br glycosidic bond cleavage by cellulase enzymes has 
not as yet been firmly established for a range of cellulase 
enzyme systems.
