Evaluation of the Biodegradation of Starch and Cellulose
Under Controlled Composting Conditions
Francesco Degli-Innocenti,1,2 Maurizio Tosin,2 and Catia Bastioli2
In order to verify the response of the controlled composting test method (i.e., the ISO/DIS
14855:1997, the ASTM D 5338-92, or the CEN counterpart) to starch at different concentrations,
the maximum amount prescribed by the test method (100 g) and lower amounts (60 and 30 g), as
if starch were a coingredient in a blend, were tested. After 44 days of incubation (at a constant
temperature of 58°C) the biodegradation curves were in a plateau phase, displaying the following
final values (referred to a nominal starch initial amount of 100 g): starch 100 g, 97.5%; starch 60 g,
63.7%; and starch 30 g, 32.5%. The data show a CCh evolution roughly equal, in each case, to the
theoretical maximum, indicating a complete starch mineralization. We cannot discern whether the
deviations found at lower concentrations are caused by a priming effect. In any case, the extent of
the deviations is not high and is acceptable in biodegradation studies. The average biodegradation of
cellulose, obtained gathering four independent experiments with 11 biodegradation curves, turned
out to be 96.8 ± 6.7% (SD) after 47 ± 1 days. The data indicate that the controlled composting
is a reliable test method also for starch and cellulose and, consequently, for starch-based and
cellulose-based materials.
INTRODUCTION
The respirometric test methods used to assess
biodegradability of a given substrate in solid state are
based on the determination of the net CO2 evolution,
i.e., the CO2 evolved from the mixture substrate-soil
(or substrate-compost) minus the CO2 evolved from the
unamended soil (or compost) tested in a different reactor
(the background CO2 production). The net CO2 evolu-
tion is ascribed to the mineralization of the substrate. The
assumption of this approach is that the addition of the
test substrate does not significantly alter the background
CO2 evolution of the solid matrix. It has been reported
that glucose and its polymers can stimulate the min-
eralization of the organic matrices used in solid-phase
biodegradation studies [1, 2]. This induction, called the
"priming effect," has raised many concerns regarding the

posting (coco) test [3,4] and the soil contact test [5]. The
measurement of the biodegradability with the coco test
is considered a very important procedure for the defini-
tion of the compostability of plastics and packaging. As
a matter of fact, the coco test method has been standard-
ized by several organizations, such as the ASTM (AMST
D5338-92), the CEN (Cen Draft), and the ISO (ISO/DIS
14855), in order to be used within the respective com-
postability guidelines. The substantiation of the reliabil-
ity of the coco test method is, therefore, an outstanding
issue, because it is at the foundation of the compostabil-
ity criteria under discussion.
In a biodegradation study under composting con-
ditions with 14C-labeled glucose and cellulose, a com-
plete biodegradation of the two substrates could be estab-
lished using the traditional respirometric approach, that
is measuring the cold, net CO2 evolution (about 95% for
glucose and 100% for cellulose), while the simultaneous

14C-CO2/14C-glucose (or cellulose) measurements indi-
cated only =50% biodegradation [6].
This means that only about 50% of the total net
CO2 produced by the mixture substrate-compost derived
directly from the radiolabeled substrate. The remaining
fraction derived from the (cold) organic carbon present in
the compost before the addition of the radiolabeled sub-
strate. This is indisputable proof that a substantial miner-
alization of the compost is occurring and it is considered as
strong evidence toward the "priming effect" hypothesis. A
major consequence of this explanation is that the reliabil-
ity of the coco test method is drastically reduced, when-
ever a "priming" substrate is tested, because a significant
overestimation of the real biodegradation can be expected.
Still, the data do not indicate a failure of the coco mea-
surements. In fact, in the same study it was proved, using
radiolabeling techniques, that the original substrate (glu-
cose and cellulose) was not recoverable from the matrix
in the end of the experiments [7]. This is an indication
that the coco method, even if based on the cold, net
CO2 measurements, gives an accurate representation of
the biodegradation degree reached by the substrate. As
a matter of fact, complete substrate removal was accom-
panied by =100% production of CO2 (with both glucose
and cellulose). The lower than expected evolution of 14C-
COa strongly suggests that an exchange process between
the 14C deriving from the substrate and the organic car-
bon in the matrix (i.e., biomass, compost, humic acids)
occurs. A possible hypothetical explanation is the follow-
ing: metabolic turnover is triggered after substrate (glu-
cose or its polymers) addition and, operating for a lim-
ited time, "traps" some 14C within biomass (i.e., in cellu-
lar structures). However, an equivalent amount of carbon
present in the biomass before the addition of the substrate
(and, therefore, cold) is released by the turnover process
and eventually respired in place of the radiolabeled car-
bon, so that the actual COa evolved is equivalent to the
CO2 expected in the case of full mineralization of the test
substance. It was not the aim of this work to clarify the fate
of the radiolabeled starch (or cellulose) when biodegraded
in the coco system. We rather wanted to give some further
piece of information to verify the accuracy of the coco test
method in measuring starch and cellulose biodegradation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Test Substances
Corn starch (GL 03405) was purchased by Cerestar.
Cellulose microcrystalline (Avicel) was purchased fromMerck. The carbon content was, respectively, 44.44 and
42.50% (determined by elemental analysis). The com-
post was obtained from a composting plant located in
Alessandria (Italy), treating sewage sludge and bark at a
1:1 ratio. The percentage of volatile substances of this
compost (substances evaporated at 550°C) was 59.27%
(dry weight).
Apparatus
The controlled composting apparatus used in this
work has been described previously [8]. Compressed air
pressure is reduced by a pressure reduction device to
about 0.5 atm. The flow is then split into 12 lines, cor-
responding to 12 composting reactors. The airflow rate
of each line is measured by a rotameter and adjusted by
a valve (Flow-Meter srl, Italy) and led to the reactor by
means of natural rubber thick tubing (Ascenso, Italy).
The air is fluxed upward in each reactor (3-L glass bot-
tles) via a hollow shaft finishing with a "T." The reac-
tors are heated in a thermostatic water bath. The exit gas
is passed, before measurement, through a water-cooled
glass coil, to trap the vapor. The airflow rate of each line
is measured with a precision rotameter (Flow-Meter srl)
and the CO2 concentration is measured by an infrared
CO2 detector (Gas Monitor ADC 2000 Series, The Ana-
lytical Development Company, UK). The CO2 evolution
rate (CER) is calculated by multiplying the CO2 concen-
tration (g/L) by the airflow rate (L/h). The amount of
CO2 produced during the time interval within two mea-
surements is estimated by multiplying the CER by the
elapsed time from the last measurement. The mineral-
ization percentage is the ratio between the total net CO2
produced by the sample and the amount produced in the
case of complete transformation of its carbon into CO2.
Test Setup
A mixture of mature compost (600 g, dry weight)
and test material (100 g or less) is introduced in each
reactor and maintained under thermophilic (58°C) nd
aerobic conditions for 45 or more days. Three replicates
for test material and blank reactors are used (see Table
I). The quantity of substances to be tested is determined
by weighing with a precision balance (Sartorius MC1).
At the beginning of the test, the water content is adjusted
at 50%. The water content is then periodically controlled
by weighing each reactor and adding water to restore the
initial weight, if needed.

Effect of Using Normal Air Instead of
Decarbonated Air
The equipment and procedures described above are
based on the CEN draft [9], with the following modifi-
cation. Normal compressed air is used instead of decar-
bonated air. The CO2 present in the compressed air is
measured, subtracted, and not taken into account. To ver-
ify that this procedure does not introduce some distur-
bance to the test system, a preliminary experiment has
bee performed. The CO2 production of six identical sam-
ples of compost was measured using either decarbonated
air (three reactors) or normal air, following our proce-
dure (three reactors). The results, shown in Fig. 1, indi-
cate that the use of normal air does not affect the CO2
assessment.Table I. Test Setup

RESULTS
Biodegradation of Starch Under Composting
Conditions
To verify the capability of the coco test method to
respond to different amounts of starch, we checked the
maximum amount prescribed by the test method (100 g)
and lower amounts (60 and 30 g), as if starch were a coin-
gredient in a blend. In Table II the cumulative CO2 pro-
duction of each reactor is shown. In Table III the percent-
age of theoretical C02 after 44 days of incubation at 58°C
is reported (average), along with the individual values ofthe three replicates for each group. The data are plotted in
Fig. 2. Full mineralization of starch occurred at each con-
centration. In both the 30- and the 60-g series the aver-
age mineralization values after 44 days were higher than
100%, the theoretical maximum. The deviation is, in both
cases, caused mainly by one replicate displaying an erratic
behavior in comparison with the other two. In fact, two
replicates are very similar and very close to 100% (102.7
and 103.5 for the 60-g set, 99.4 and 100.4 for the 30-g set),
while the other is much more divergent (112.3 for the 60-g
set, 125.9 for the 30-g set). In any case the average devia-
tion is not high.

Starch and Cellulose Biodegradation Under Composting Conditions 201
DISCUSSION
The data shown in this paper indicate that the coco
test method is capable of responding to the starch present
in the system with a variability which is inversely pro-
portional to the initial starch concentration. Low at a
high starch concentration, it increases at a lower con-
centration, still being remarkably satisfactory. We cannot
discern whether the deviation found at lower concentra-
tions is caused by a decrease in sensitivity at lower CO2
productions or whether it is caused by a priming effect.
In any case, the extent of the deviation is not high and
is acceptable in biodegradation studies.
The data concerning the biodegradation of cellulose
show that, in some cases, values higher than 100% can be
found. The overcoming of the 100% limit (in one case a
109% value was reached after 50 days) could be consid-
ered as a clear sign that a priming effect is acting. How-
ever, these "over-100%" values could be seen as a con-
sequence of the error of the measurement. As a matter of
fact, when a sufficient number of replicates is taken into
account, the average value turns out to be very close to,Mineralization of Cellulose Under Composting
Conditions
Microcristalline cellulose for chromatography (Avi-
cel by Merck) is frequently used as a reference material
in the controlled composting tests. To verify the repro-
ducibility of the coco test method, we plotted the data of
four independent trials with three replicates each (only
two in one case) for a total of 11 biodegradation curves
of cellulose. The data are shown in Fig. 3. The average
mineralization value of cellulose, determined grouping
the data collected after 47 ± 1 days, is 96.8 ± 6.7% (SD).

but below, 100%. Therefore, also for cellulose, as seen
before for starch, the data indicate a full mineralization
of the substrate after 45-50 days.
The variability of the test method is, in our opinion,
acceptable considering that it is a biological system. The
data reported here give support to the hypothesis that the
coco test is a reliable system also for starch and cellulose
and, consequently, for starch-based and cellulose-based
materials.
