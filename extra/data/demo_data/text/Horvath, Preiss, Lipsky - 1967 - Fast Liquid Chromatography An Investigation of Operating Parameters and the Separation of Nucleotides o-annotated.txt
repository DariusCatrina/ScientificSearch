While allofthepeaks arenotcompletely resolved, anin-
crease incolumn length would most likely improve resolution
greatly. Initial chromatograms ofthe same mixture on a
column 750 mmlong showed celloheptaose and cellohexaose
barely distinguishable asseparate peaks. Using the same
resin ina1000-mm column gave thechromatogram inFigure
9.Allofthecellodextrins except celloheptaose were easily
soluble in0.10M boric acid adjusted topH 7.0with sodium
hydroxide. Celloheptaose entered solution completely after
several hours stirring atabout 40° C.Higher homologs
ofglucose have notbeen used inthissystem, butitisdoubtful
ifany beyond the nonaose could bedissolved without in-
creasing thealkalinity ofthesolvent. This would present
thepossibility ofsplitting, particularly atthecolumn tem-
peratures used.
The peaks inthechromatogram ofthepulp hydrolyzate in
Figure 10represent thefollowing polymer contents ofthe
pulp, expressed aspercent byweight ofdrypulp: mannan
6.9, araban 0.7, galactan 0.9, xylan 5.6, and glucan 69.1.
While thefirst 2hours ofthechromatogram arenotshown in
Figure 10,three very small, butsharp and narrow peaks oc-
curred, twoofwhich corresponded tothefurfural and hy-
droxymethyl furfural positions, and thethird totheposition
normally occupied byrhamnose.CONCLUSIONS
Ion-exchange chromatography ofborate-carbohydrate
complex anions oncolumns ofstrong-base anion-exchange
resins offers arelatively rapid method ofquantitative analysis
ofsugar mixtures, particularly when column effluents are
monitored forsugars byanautomatic analyzer. There are no
derivatives toprepare, and aproperly sized column can be
used simultaneously foranalytical andpreparative purposes.
The same method isapplicable toother areas ofcarbohydrate
chemistry, having been shown tohave theability torapidly
resolve mixtures ofoligosaccharides and hemicelluloses in
solution. The amounts ofindividual saccharides measurable
canvary inawide range from lessthan amicrogram, using
a3-mm diameter column, toseveral decigrams on a1-inch
column.

Fast Liquid Chromatography: AnInvestigation
ofOperating Parameters andtheSeparation of
Nucleotides onPellicular IonExchangers

Section ofPhysical Sciences, Yale University School ofMedicine, New Haven, Conn.
Aliquid chromatographic system featuring high inlet
pressures and asensitive UVdetector was designedforfast analysis ofnonvolatile organic compounds.
Toestablish optimal operating conditions, band dis-
persion inthemobile phase was studied byusing
capillary tubes aswell assmall bore columns packedwith glass beads. Although peak broadening inopentubes was less than predicted bytheory, the useof
packed columns was more promising forfast separa-tions. Novel pellicular column materials were pre-
pared bycoating glass beads with Ionexchange resin
and other solid phases. Rapid separation ofnano-
mole quantities ofribonucleoside mono-, di-, and
triphosphates wasachieved byusing apellicular basic
ionexchanger andgradient elution with aphosphatebuffer. Asshown bycellular extract analyses, the
stability and efficiency provided bysuch column
materials makes itpossible toachieve fastseparationofcomplex mixtures by aliquid chromatographic
technique similar inspeed, resolution, andquantita-tiverange togaschromatography.
Atechnique fortheseparation ofnonvolatile substances
which encompasses the speed, efficiency, sensitivity, and
versatility ofgaschromatography hasyettobedevised. The
present study was undertaken inaneffort toinvestigate the
feasibility ofdeveloping aliquid chromatographic system
which could approach thisgoal. Themethod which evolvedwasthen utilized fortheanalysis ofthenucleoside phosphoric
acids.

sole mass transfer mechanism, analogous operating condi-
tions ingasandliquid chromatography would require flow
velocities 10stimes lower inliquid than ingaschromatography
because diffusion coefficients areoftheorder of10-6 cm2 sec-
ond-1 inliquids and 10-1 cm2 second-1 ingases: conse-
quently thetime ofanalysis would beincreased bythe same
factor. Obviously, high speed liquid chromatography can-
not occur under those analogous conditions.
One can express theplate height (neglecting longitudinal
diffusion) asthe sumofthree terms
 =f(Hm/u) +Cm2u +Csu (3)
Hill=Hnju +Cm2+Cs (4)
Thefirstterm, Hm,represents theplate height contribution due
topeak dispersion inthemobile phase streaming through the
column; thedependence ofthisterm onflow velocity isnot
completely understood. The second term, Cm2u, stems from
the mass transfer resistance bythestagnant mobile phase in
theintraparticle pores ofthepacking. Thethird term, Csu,
isrelated tononequilibrium due tothestationary phase.
The three terms ofEquation 4should beminimized inorder
toobtain anincrease inspeed ofanalysis.
One conceivable approach istoreduce theparticle sizein
packed columns. With porous granules Cm2, andwith con-
ventional ionexchange resins, Cm2and Cs,decrease with the
square oftheparticle diameter. Thus, extremely finesilica
particles were used forfastseparation inliquid-solid chroma-
tography (4),and significant acceleration oftheanalysis of
amino acids and peptides byionexchange chromatography
(5,6)hasbeen achieved byusing very small uniform spherical
resins.
Another approach involves the useofopen tubular columns
orcolumns packed with afluid-impermeable support where
Cm2=0,andwhere Cscan besmall ifthedepth oftheproper
stationary phase issmall. Under these conditions the
velocity-dependent first term, Hm/u, inEquation 4,which
arises from thenonuniform flow pattern, becomes very im-
portant.
Forlaminar flow instraight open tubes according toTaylor
(7),
where disthetube diameter and DMisthediffusion coefficient
ofthesolute inthemobile phase. This term becomes very
high for aliquid mobile phase asaconsequence oflowdif-
fusivity inliquids, and the useofopen tubular columns does
notappear tobefavorable under laminar flow conditions in
liquid chromatography.
Pretorius and Smuts (8)have proposed theoperation of
open tubular columns with turbulent flow which ischar-
acterized byvery lowH¡u values. Ingaschromatography,
this effect ofturbulence has been proved experimentally (9)
and anabrupt drop inplate height wasfound. Theexploita-
tionofturbulence inanalytical work, however, islimited by
theinlet pressure requirements (probably several thousand

turbulence insmall bore columns.
Under laminar andturbulent flowconditions inhelical open
tubes radial mass transfer isenhanced bysecondary flow in
the cross sectional plane (10). Exploitation ofthis effect in
chromatography hasnotbeen attempted asyet.
Inpacked columns, thefluid flows intheinterstitial chan-
nelsofthepacking. Atlowflow velocities, molecular dif-
fusion isthedominant mass transfer mechanism inthemobile
phase, butwith increasing flow velocity thecontribution ofa
convective lateral mixing which depends onthepacking struc-
ture becomes more significant. The result isaflattening of
theHvs. ucurve inthehigh velocity region. According to
Giddings (11) thetwo mechanisms arecoupled. Heorig-
inally proposed forHmthefollowing expression
Hm=(V, dv+ ,,/  dp*u)-i (6)
where Xand  areparameters related topacking structure and
dpistheparticle size. Giddings has now extended Equation
9toasummation form which ismuch more general (12).
Knox (13)studied thiseffect inliquid chromatography using
columns packed with glass beads andobserved amore gradual
flattening oftheHvs. ucurve inthehigh velocity region
than predicted bythecoupling theory. Inliquid chromatog-
raphy, owing tothelow rateofmolecular diffusion, coupling
becomes significant atrelatively lowflow velocities and de-
termines Hm over arange ofseveral orders ofmagnitude inu.
Inpacked columns there isnosudden onset ofturbulence
and thedecrease ofhwith increasing fluid velocity isnot as
pronounced asthatinopen tubes (9).

Inthepresent study, theeffect ofvarious parameters on
Hminhelical capillary tubes andinsmall bore columns packed
with glass beads wasinvestigated. The results suggested the
useofglass beads coated with athin skin (pellicle) ofsta-
tionary phase inapacked column. Therapid separation of
nucleoside phosphoric acids was then achieved byutilizing
ionexchange resin-coated glass spheres.
EXPERIMENTAL
Figure1shows ablock diagram oftheinstrument used.
For unsorbed solutes, adifferential refractometer (Emmett
Watson Associates, Ridgefield, Conn.) having acellvolume
of7µ was used asdetector.
For nucleotides, thedetector was aPerkin-Elmer-Hitachi
UVIS 139spectrophotometer modified toaccommodate a
specially designed micro flow cellhaving avolume of 8µ\
and4-mm path length. With ascale expander, afull scale
signal (1mV) could beobtained at0.04 absorbance unit.
Inthisvery lowabsorbance range, atconstant flow rate and
buffer composition, peak areas were considered tobelinearly
dependent ontheamount ofsolute present. Analyses were
performed atawavelength of260mgandslitwidth of2mm.
Thefluid wasforced through thesystem byaMilton Roy
Minipump which provided leak-free operation atpressures
upto4000 psiinthelowcapacity range (0-20 mlperhour).
A300-ml glass cylinder equipped with animmersion heater
and magnetic stirrer served as asolvent reservoir. For
gradient elution, asecond Milton Roy Minipump was em-
ployed toaddthestronger eluent totheweaker eluent placed
inthereservoir. Incertain experiments aGreer Accumulator
(Greer Olaer Products, Los Angeles, Calif.) was used to
generate nonpulsating flow.
Thetemperature ofthesystem wascontrolled byaStatham
thermostated chamber, Model SD10-1. A0-10,000 psi
Helicoid gauge with“capillary bleed” was used formonitoring
column inlet pressures. Inthe continuous flow mode,
sampling was performed with amodified Loenco sampling
valve. Intheintermittent flow mode, a10-gl Hamilton
syringe was used toinject thesample onto thecolumn.
The pellicular ionexchange resin used inthis study was
prepared asfollows. Glass beads (dp¡sa50microns) were
coated with asolution ofstyrene, divinylbenzene, andbenzoyl
peroxide inether and thesolvent was evaporated. Polym-
erization andcrosslinking were carried out at90°Cinan
aqueous suspension ofthecoated beads. Theproduct was
washed with water, acetone, benzene, and methanol, then
converted into theion exchange resin. The anion-active
resin was prepared bychloromethylating thepolymer and
reacting theproduct with dimethylbenzylamine. Thepellicu-
larionexchange resin was then sieved and washed with 2M
NaOH and HC1 solutions anddried.
Although the useofthis resin only isdiscussed, other
resins were prepared and also found tobeuseful. For ex-
ample, cation-active resin was prepared bysulfonating the
coating ofglass beads (dp»50microns) with 98% sulfuric
acid at90° Cfor 30minutes. For making crosslinked
polyethylene-imine resin, the water from commercial poly-
ethylene-imine (Dow Chemical Co.) wasremoved bydistilla-
tion with benzene. Glass beads (dp~100 microns) were
coated with asolution ofthedry polyethylene-imine in
methylene chloride and thesolvent was evaporated. The
coated beads were then exposed tomethylene bromide vapor
at130° Cfor 10minutes inorder tocrosslink thepolymer.
Theproduct was washed with acetone, water, diluted hydro-
chloric acid, then with water, anddried.
Thedrycolumn material waspacked intostraight stainless-
steel (No. 316) tubing (1-mm i.d., 0.0625-inch o.d.) byvibra-
tion and tapping. The outlet ofthecolumn was plugged
with athin diskofporous Teflon. Toconsolidate thepack-
ing, deaerated mobile phase waspumped through thecolumn
inperpendicular position for5-6hours, atinlet pressures ofHmcm

3500-4000 psi. This treatment caused thepacking tocon-
tract afew centimeters. The column was then coiled and
connected totheinstrument.
After resieving, glass microbeads (Microbeads Inc., Jack-
son, Miss.) were soaked inchromic sulfuric acid overnight,
washed with water and methanol, and dried. Although
reagent grade chemicals were used forthepreparation of
buffers, some were contaminated with ultraviolet absorbing
materials which gave rise to asignificant base linedrift
during gradient elution. Reference mixtures were prepared
bydissolving the purest available nucleotides inwater.
Perchloric acid extracts ofmouse brain andliver were made
intheusual manner andconcentrated bylyophilization.
Thelinear gradient used inthese analyses wasproduced by
maintaining theflow rate through thecolumn twice ashigh
astheflow rate ofthestronger eluent into the reservor.
Samples were injected with amicrosyringe atintermittent
flow. After closing thesampling ports, both pumps were
started atthe same time; however, the sample was first
eluted with theweak eluent which filled upthevolume ofthe
system between thereservoir outlet and thecolumn inlet
(approximately 1.7ml). After each analysis thecolumn was
regenerated with approximately 15mlofliquid. Thus each
run was preceded by a25-minute reconditioning period.
Thecolumn was used over 5months with various acidic and
neutral saltsolutions andoccasionally with aqueous ethanol.
Nevertheless, retention times remain reproducible onthe
properly reconditioned column.
RESULTS
Study ofPeak Broadening inColumns without Stationary
Phase. To assess thesignificance ofsecondary flow (70)in
capillary columns, solute band spreading incoiled uncoated
open tubes was investigated. The dimensions ofthe two
helical columns (IandII)made ofthin-walled stainless-steel
tubing were asfollows: Column Iwas0.4-mm o.d.by0.276-
mm i.d.with ahelix diameter (Dh) of85mm. The Dh;i.d.
was 308. Column IIwas 0.4-mm o.d. by0.287-mm i.d.,
Dh1.28 mm, and the7),,/i.d. 4.5. The plots ofplate height
(77m) vs.flowvelocity (u)obtained byinjecting KC1 and sucrose
astracers inwater onto these columns at38°Caredepicted
inFigure 2.
Peak dispersion inColumn I(broken lines) andColumn II
(dotted lines) islessthan calculated byEquation5(unbroken
lines) butnevertheless unacceptably large forchromatography.
1424 ·ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY

Instead ofthelinear increase ofHwith laminar flow ve-
locity, aspredicted byTaylor andGolay, theHvs. ucurve
tends toflatten athigh flow velocities. Contrary totheexist-
ingbelief inchromatography, adecrease inthehelix-diam-
eter-to-column-inside-diameter ratio results inadecrease in
plate height.
The higher plate heights obtained inboth columns forthe
more slowly diffusing sucrose indicates that molecular dif-
fusion plays asignificant roleinmass transfer under these
conditions.
Although flattening oftheHvs. ucurves incoiled open
tubes asshown inFigure 2was expected asaconsequence of
secondary flow (10), therelatively small effect ofcoil-to-tube-
diameter ratio incomparison tothestrong effect ofdiffusivity
suggests that other mechanisms cooperate inreducing H/u.
Itwasthought that theroughness oftheinner wallofthetube
orthepulsating character oftheflow might beresponsible
forthedeparture from theparabolic flow pattern. Thewall
effect isvery difficult toassess butmicroscopic examination
ofthetube interior revealed nounusual roughness. Onthe
other hand, Aris (14) proved theoretically that theeffect of
pulsation onpeak dispersion inopen tubes atlaminar flow
isinsignificant unless the mean pressure gradient issmaller
than theamplitude ofthepressure gradient fluctuations. This
isingood agreement with ourfindings with packed columns
under thepresent experimental conditions because neither
thepulsating northenonpulsating character oftheflow had
anydemonstrable effect onplate height orretention times.
Although peak dispersion inopen capillary tubes continues
tobe aninteresting theoretical problem, the useofopen
tubular columns under these circumstances does notappear
tobeapromising approach tohigh speed liquid chromatog-
raphy because theHm/u values calculated from data shown
inFigure 2aremuch higher than those ingaschromatography.
Inorder tofindoptimal conditions formicroanalysis, band
spreading intwo 150-cm long by1-mm i.d.columns packed
with uncoated glass beads wasinvestigated. The small tube
diameter was chosen tolessen trans column effects detri-
mental tocolumn performance (15). The contribution of
theinjection and detector system topeak broadening was
negligible inthese experiments.
Inthetracer experiments (Figure 3)with these columns,
solutes ofvarious diffusivities were used inorder toobserve
theeffect ofparticle size, flow velocity, and molecular dif-
fusion onpeak spreading. Thus, 10pgofKC1 (Dm=2.43
X10-5), sucrose (Dm=7.25 X10-6), and albumin (Dm
=7X10-7) were injected inthecarrier stream ofdeaerated
water. The column temperature was 38°Candflow was
laminar. Novariation inplate height wasfound with de-
creasing thesample sizedown to2pg.
With Column Btheflattening oftheHm vs. ucurves be-
comes significant atflow velocities ofabout 0.2 cmsecond-1.
Aspredicted bythecoupling theory, the curves converge at
high flow velocities indicating anincreasing contribution to
lateral mass transfer from convection anddecreasing contribu-
tion from molecular diffusion. With Column Atheplate
height issignificantly greater relative totheparticle diameter
than expected from data from thechemical engineering liter-
ature orfrom that published byKnox (13). Thediscrepancy
isattributed tothesmall particle andtube sizes used inthis
study compared tothose described intheliterature.

Inchromatography, however, arelatively large surface
areaofthesupport material isneeded forthefinedistribution
ofthestationary phase. The surface areaofglass spheres is
inversely proportional tothe diameter. Thus, the layer
thickness ofagiven amount ofstationary phase inthecolumn
decreases with theparticle diameter. Because the plate
height contribution ofthestationary phase isproportional
tothesquare ofthelayer thickness, asmall particle size is
attractive toreduce this term. Ontheother hand, theflow
resistance ofthecolumn decreases with thesquare ofthe
particle diameter; therefore, theavailable inlet pressure limits
particle sizereduction.
Theparticle sizerange selected forthese experiments repre-
sents apractical compromise forchromatographic applica-
tion. Inboth columns Aand B,Hm¡u decreased with flow
velocity butappeared toapproach aminimum value atthe
highest velocities, although significant reduction wasachieved
byincreasing flow velocity to1-2 cmsecond-1. Afurther
increase inugave only marginal improvement inHm/u with
alarge increase intheinlet pressure. Thus, 1<u<2cm

rable initspractical significance totheoptimum practical

flow velocity andflow rate obtained with thepellicular anion
exchanger column
The comparison ofopen tubular and packed columns in-
dicates that thelatter aresuperior forliquid chromatography.
First, more favorable Hmju values areobtained with packed
columns than with open tubes. Second, because oftheir higher
sample capacity andperformance, ahigher concentration of
the emerging solutes isobtained with small-bore packed
columns than with open tubes. This wasparticularly im-
portant with respect tothesensitivity ofpresently available
detection systems.
Performance ofaPellicular Ion Exchange Column. For
separation ofnucleotides [ribonucleoside monophosphoric
acids (2'and3'orifnotindicated, 5'): CMP (cytidylic acid),
UMP (urydylic acid), AMP (adenylic acid), GMP (guanylic
acid); ribonucleoside diphosphoric acids: CDP, UDP,
ADD, GDP; ribonucleoside triphosphoric acids: CTP, UTP,
ATP, GTP], a193-cm long, 1-mm i.d.column was packed
with No. 275-325 sieve fraction ofglass beads coated with an
anion exchanger containing benzyl-dimethylammonium
groups. The capacity oftheresin was 8microequivalents
pergram asdetermined bythemethod ofHelfferich (17).
Figure 4shows plots ofplate number and pressure drop
against thelinear flowvelocity for 3'UMP and 3'AMP. The
column capacity ratios (k)forthese solutes were 3and 10,re-
spectively, large enough fortheplate numbers toreflect the
resolving power ofthecolumn. The flow rate, F,and the
flow rate persquare centimeter, /,areindicated inFigure 4
toallow comparison ofourflow conditions with those in
other liquid chromatographic systems. The retention time
ofanunsorbed solute was measured with cytosine, which
was notsignificantly retarded under theconditions ofthe
experiment. The plate numbers are50-100 times smaller
than those measured with unsorbed solutes because ofthe
stationary phase inthecolumn, andconsequently with 3'AMP
H/u values were 1-2 orders ofmagnitude greater. Again,
itwas noteconomical toincrease theflow velocity above the
practical optimum range, asasmall additional increase in
speed ofanalysis requires alarge increase ofinlet pressure.
Therefore, foranalytical work with this column, theflow
velocity wasfixed atu=1.2cmsecond-1.
Factors Affecting Retention. Because thecomposition of
themobile phase greatly influences thebehavior ofsolutes
inthestationary phase, buffer solutions other than those
utilized inthisstudy might provide better column performance

Thecolumn performance improved with temperature dueto
increased solute diffusivity inboth phases. Athigh tempera-
tures, asignificant reduction intailing was also observed.
Thus, rapid analysis canbeachieved atthehighest temperature
tolerable forthesolutes, thestationary phase, andthemobile
phase.
Because increase oftemperature reduces k,(seeFigure 6),
thiscombined with improvements inspeed may enable many
compounds conventionally analyzed atrelatively low tem-
peratures and residing inthecolumn formany hours tobe
separated athigher temperatures without decomposition.
Thus, although nucleotides (particularly nucleoside di-and
triphosphates) arerelatively labile substances, nodecomposi-
tion was observed inourwork during thechromatographic
runs at70°C.
Columns packed with pellicular ion exchange resins are
characterized byalarge ratio ofmobile phase tostationary
phase compared tocolumns packed with theconventional
ionexchange resin. Thus, theeluent strength ofthemobile
phase canbemuch lower inthepellicular ionexchange column
than intheconventional column inorder toobtain the same
mass distribution ratio.
Nucleotide Separation. Nucleotides were among thefirst
biochemical substances tobeseparated byion exchange
chromatography (18). Amajor advance wasmade byAnder-
son and hiscolleagues (19)with thedevelopment ofauto-
mated ionexchange chromatography similar tothat used for
amino acid analysis (20). Although rapid separation ofrela-
tively simple nucleotides can beachieved bythin layer chro-
matography (21), theanalysis ofnucleic acid hydrolyzates
ismost commonly carried outby means ofconventional

mole quantities ofamino acids byusing small-bore columns.
Recent work ofCohn andUriel (22) shows that theanalysis
ofnucleic acid bases and nucleosides atthenanomole level
can beachieved oncolumns packed with afine resin atin-
creased detector sensitivity.
Similar modifications must improve the speed and sensi-
tivity ofanalysis ofnucleotides. However, the useofcon-
ventional ionexchange resins isbeset bysome inherent dif-
ficulties. Large differences intheequilibrium constants for
the mono-, di-, and triphosphate nucleotides require a
strong gradient oftheeluent: theaccompanying shrinking
and swelling causes undesirable changes incolumn per-
meability and column performance. Ion exchange resins
contain lowmolecular weight contaminants which give rise
tocolumn bleeding, which isundesirable when one wishes to
collect eluted compounds and which causes base linedrift
with ultraviolet detectors.
These difficulties are overcome bythe useofpellicular ion
exchange resins which alsopermit thefastanalysis ofminute
quantities ofnucleoside phosphoric acids. Figures 7-9
show chromatograms ofnucleotide mixtures analyzed by
thisliquid chromatography system using gradient elution
with different buffer solutions. The analysis time compares
well with thatforgaschromatography. Because theorder
ofelution isthe same asthatwith Dowex-1 columns, the re-
tention mechanism fortheclassical and pellicular ion ex-
change resin isprobably the same.

bythechromatograms ofcellular extracts ofmouse brain
andliver inFigure 10. Although theidentification ofthe
individual peaks hasyettobecompleted, thechromatograitis
indicate more components tobepresent than arerevealed by
conventional separation methods.
Oftheother pellicular resins mentioned above, pellicular
polyethyleneimine resin was useful forthefastseparation of
nucleic acid bases and nucleosides. Pellicular alumina and
carbon black were also effective intheseparation oflipids.
Column efficiency and optimum operating conditions were
similar tothose described inthisstudy.
Inconclusion, the useofpellicular column materials in
small bore columns arewidely applicable forliquid chroma-
tography. Thestability andefficiency ofsuch materials make
itpossible toachieve fastseparation ofcomplex mixtures by
aliquid chromatographic technique similar inspeed, resolu-
tion, andquantitative range togaschromatography.

Anelectron absorption detector which incorporates a
63Ni source has been designed forsafe operation to
400° C.Theanalytical advantages ofhightemperature
operation have been studied soastoextend thegeneral
utility ofthisclass ofdetector ingaschromatography.
Expansion ofthepractical temperature range reduces
detector contamination andprovides abroader insight
into thetemperature dependency phenomena ob-
served forcertain compounds. Moreover, the new
design retains allofthedesirable performance charac-
teristics oftheestablished Lovelock parallel plate
electron capture detector when operated inthepulsed
sampling mode.
Since itsinception in1960 (7),theelectron absorption de-
tector hasenjoyed aunique positionasaremarkably sensitive
andhighly selective detector for gaschromatography. The
precipitous acceptance ofthisdetector asapowerful adjunct
togaschromatography tended toobscure some ofthe errors
inherent initsearlier designs and modes ofoperation. In
1963 Lovelock described theplane parallel design which,
when operated with pulse collection potential, substantially

thesuccessful calculation ofelectron affinities andbond dis-
sociation energies for anumber ofcompounds based onin-
formation obtained through the useofthedetector atvarious
temperatures (4-7). These studies hadsignificant analytical
importance, inthat alinear relationship between detector
