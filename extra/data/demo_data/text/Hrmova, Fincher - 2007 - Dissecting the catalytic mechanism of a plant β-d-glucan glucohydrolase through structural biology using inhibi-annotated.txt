18 March 2008We have determined the crystal structure of Streptococcus mutans dextran
glucosidase, which hydrolyzes the α-1,6-glucosidic linkage of isomaltooli-
gosaccharides from their non-reducing ends to produce α-glucose. By using
the mutant of catalytic acid Glu236 →Gln, its complex structure with the
isomaltotriose, a natural substrate of this enzyme, has been determined. Theenzyme has 536 amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 62,001 Da. The
native and the complex structures were determined by the molecular
replacement method and refined to 2.2 Å resolution, resulting in a final R-
factor of 18.3% for significant reflections in the native structure and 18.4% in
the complex structure. The enzyme is composed of three domains, A, B and
C, and has a ( β/α)
8-barrel in domain A, which is common to the α-amylase
family enzymes. Three catalytic residues are located at the bottom of theactive site pocket and the bound isomaltotriose occupies subsites −1 to +2.
The environment of the glucose residue at subsite −1 is similar to the
environment of this residue in the α-amylase family. Hydrogen bonds
between Asp60 and Arg398 and O4 atom of the glucose unit at subsite −1
accomplish recognition of the non-reducing end of the bound substrate. The
side-chain atoms of Glu371 and Lys275 form hydrogen bonds with the O2and O3 atoms of the glucose residue at subsite +1. The positions of atoms
that compose the scissile α-1,6-glucosidic linkage (C1, O6 and C6 atoms) are
identical with the positions of the atoms in the scissile α-1,4 linkage (C1, O4
and C4 atoms) of maltopentaose in the α-amylase structure from Bacillus
subtilis . The comparison with the α-amylase suggests that Val195 of the
dextran glucosidase and the corresponding residues of α-1,6-hydrolyzing
enzymes participate in the determination of the substrate specificity of theseenzymes.

Introduction
Starch hydrolases and related enzymes are
classified into the α-amylase family, which includesα-amylases, cyclodextrin glucanotransferases, oligo-
1,6-glucosidases (O16G), pullulanases, isoamylases,
branching enzymes and neopullulanases.1,2The
enzymes of this family possess common three-
dimensional structural features. The degree of
amino acid sequence similarity between membersof the α-amylase family is not very high. However,
these enzymes have four short conserved regions I –
IV in common, which include the catalytic residuesand other amino acids essential for stabilization of
the transition state.

enzymes have a catalytic domain (domain A), con-
taining a ( β/α)8-barrel, with a small domain
(domain B) inserted between the third β-strand
and the third α-helix of domain A. The specificities
of these enzymes for the cleavage of glucosidiclinkages can be classified into one of two types: α-
1,4-glucosidic linkage-specific or α-1,6-glucosidic
linkage-specific.
One of the best-known α-1,4 linkage hydrolyzing
enzymes is α-amylase. The crystal structure of Taka-
amylase was determined in 1984,4and numerous
structural studies of α-amylases complexed with
products, substrate analogues and natural substrates
have been carried out to clarify the structural basis forsubstrate specificity.5–15The structure of the natural
substrate complex revealed the details of the interac-
tion between α-amylase and its substrate.13The
conformation of the glucosidic linkage of the boundsubstrate (or analogue) at the cleavage site of these
enzymes is kinked, allowing the substrate to fit into
the active site cleft. The significance of this kinkedconformation of the scissile bond has been described
for the structure of amylosucrase (AS).
16The kinked
conformation allows the lone pair of the glucosidicoxygen (O4 atom) of the scissile linkage to point
toward the general acid catalytic residue. This
configuration allows the minimization of the pro-ton-transfer energy barrier during catalysis.
In comparison to the extensive research in the field
ofα-amylases, there are only a few structural studies
that describe enzymes hydrolyzing α-1,6-linkages.
The crystal structure of O16G from Bacillus cereus was
determined at 3.0 Å resolution,
17and refined to 2.0 Å
resolution.18The structure of isoamylase, which
hydrolyzes the α-1,6-glucosidic linkage at the branch-
ing point of amylopectin and glycogen, has been
determined.19To date, however, only substrate-free
structures are available, and the mechanism by which
these enzymes recognize their substrates remains
obscure. Recently, an α-1,6 bond cleavage model of a
neopullulanase, which hydrolyzes both α-1,4 and α-
1,6 linkages, has been advanced by using structures
of the enzyme in complex with natural substrates.20
Because neopullulanase cleaves primarily α-1,4
linked substrates, this model cannot be extended
readily to understand substrate recognition by
enzymes hydrolyzing α-1,6 linkages. The crystal
structures of pullulanase, which is a well-known
starch-debranching enzyme, in complex with several
oligosaccharides have been reported very recently.21
Although these studies clearly demonstrate theparallel binding of maltooligosaccharides, which are
used as the model for binding of branched substrates
at the active site, the conformation of the α-1,6-
glucosidic linkage in the cleavage site is unclear.
Dextran glucosidase (DGase) from Streptococcus
mutans ,am e m b e ro ft h e α-amylase family of
enzymes, hydrolyzes α-1,6-glucosidic linkages at the
non-reducing end of panose, isomaltooligosacchar-
ides and dextran to produce α-glucose.22,23The
enzyme shows the highest kcat/Kmvalue toward
panose and the order of substrate preference is
panose Nisomaltotriose Nisomaltotetraose Nisomal-tose. The kinetic parameters for a series of isomaltoo-
ligosaccharides show that the catalytic efficiency
decreases with increasing chain length.24The native
DGase contains 536 amino acid residues (molecularmass 62,001 Da) and its amino acid sequence has ahigh particularly similarity to O16Gs in the α-amylase
family. DGase is capable of degrading relatively long
isomaltooligosaccharides and even dextran, whileO16Gs act only on short-chain substrates despite
sharing a high level of sequence identity.
25–28Our
recent studies have shown that Trp238 and short β→α
loop 4 of DGase are important for the high level of
activity of this enzyme toward long-chain sub-
strates.24Another notable feature of the DGase is a
relatively high level of transglucosylation ability,which may be useful for oligosaccharide synthesis.
Here, we report the crystal structures of DGase
from S. mutans in uncomplexed form and a mutant
(E236Q) in which catalysis is compromised in
complex with a natural substrate (isomaltotriose:
IG3) at 2.2 Å resolution. These structures reveal theresidues that mediate specific recognition of α-1,6-
glucosidic linkages and dictate the substrate speci-
ficity of α-amylase family enzymes.
Results
Overall structure
The native and substrate complex structures of
DGase have been determined by the molecular
replacement method and refined to a crystallo-
graphic R-factor ( Rfree) of 18.3% (22.2%) and 18.4%
(22.3%) at 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. DGase
consists of domains A, B and C, as shown in Fig. 1 .
Domain A contains three catalytic residues Asp194,Glu236 and Asp313, and a ( β/α)
8-barrel structure,
which are conserved among α-amylase family
enzymes. Domain B contains two helices andthree strands, and forms part of the wall of theactive site pocket. Surrounded by the two loops of
domain B (residue numbers 130 –142, and 156 –168)
andβ→αloops 4, 5, 6 and 7 of domain A (residue
numbers 195 –212, 237 –240, 269 –283, and 308 –315),
the active site cleft of DGase forms a pocket similar
to those seen in the structures of O16G,
18AS29and
sucrose phosphorylase (SP).30The catalytic residues
Asp194, Glu236 and Asp313 are located at the
bottom of this pocket. The extra α-helixes protrud-
ing near the C-terminal end of the ( β/α)8-barrel
provide the amino acid residues Glu371 and
Arg398 that are important for substrate recognition.
Domain C consists of an antiparallel, β-sheet motif
with one helix. Bound Tris and IG3 molecules are
identified as electron density at the bottom of the
active site pocket of the native structure and thesubstrate complex, respectively. A molecule of
glycerol, which was used as a cryo-protectant, is
found in the active site pocket of the native enzyme.The histidine tag at the C terminus could not be
refined, suggesting a non-definite conformation. The
r.m.s deviation between corresponding main-chain914 Crystal Structures of Dextran Glucosidase
atoms of the native and complex structures is 0.22 Å.
The conformation of the active site residues is almost
identical between the native structure and that of thecomplex, but obvious differences are found in the
side-chain of Trp238. The contact with the bound
IG3 molecule results in a movement of the side-chainatoms of Trp238, which is therefore shifted approxi-mately 1 Å away from the cleavage site.
In the crystallographic asymmetric unit, three
calcium ions, which are bound to enzymes, arefound ( Fig. 1 ). Two of them are located between
symmetry-related enzyme molecules. These two
calcium ions would be released from these sites ofDGase in the solution because each ion is fixed by two
symmetry-related enzyme molecules. The other
calcium ion is bound at the periphery of the ( β/α)
8-
barrel of an enzyme. The calcium ion is bound toAsp21 OD1, Asn23 OD1, Asp25 OD1 and OD2, Ile27
O, Asp29 OD2, and two water molecules. The
distances between the calcium ion and these atomsin the native DGase are 2.30 Å, 2.27 Å, 2.45 Å, 2.84 Å,
2.55 Å, 2.52 Å, 2.50 Å, and 2.35 Å, respectively.
Therefore, this calcium could be held tightly by thissite in solution. The conformation of this site in the
substrate complex is similar to that of native enzyme,
but the electron density of the bound water moleculewas poor. Thus, the water molecule is not included in
the substrate-complex model. O16G shows the
identical conformation at this site, but a boundcalcium ion is not included in the model of O16G.Since the crystallization solution of O16G contains
EDTA,
18the calcium ion in O16G may have been
chelated and therefore unable to bind. All thecalcium-binding sites of DGase are far from the active
site pocket and not identical with the conserved
calcium ion-binding sites among α-amylases.31
Structure in the active site pocket of the
DGase/IG3 complex
The inactive E236Q mutant was used to crystallize
and obtain the enzyme –substrate complex. Fobs–Fcalc
omit map of the active site pocket of the E236Q –IG3complex is shown in Fig. 2 . The bound IG3 molecule
was identified as electron density in the region of the
active site pockets of the catalytic acid mutant. Theglucose residues in the bound IG3 occupy three
subsites, −1 through +2. The unbroken electron
density reveals that IG3 was not hydrolyzed, and theα-1,6-glucosidic linkage at the active site crosses over
the active site of DGase. This is the first model of an
α-1,6-glucosidic linkage-hydrolyzing member of the
α-amylase family in complex with a natural sub-
strate. The electron density of the reducing end
glucose residue of IG3 is not clearly defined, most
likely because of the flexibility of this terminalresidue. The model of amino acid residues surround-
ing IG3 is shown in Fig. 2 , and a schematic drawing
of E236Q –IG3 interactions is shown in Fig. 3 . The
dihedral angles of bound IG3 are summarized in
Fig. 2. The Fobs–Fcalcomit map of the bound IG3. The
IG3 molecule was found in the active site pocket of thecatalytic acid mutant E236Q enzyme. IG3 is shown in
cyan. The numbers in cyan denote subsite numbering. The
contour level of the map is 3.0 σ. The figure was generated
using CNS and Pymol [ http://www.pymol.org ].

C5n–1andω=O6 n–1-C6 n–1-C5 n–1-C4 n–1. In subsite
−1, the glucose residue stacks against Tyr63, and is
recognized by an extensive hydrogen bonding net-work involving residues Arg192, His312 and His103.
The catalytically impo rtant residue Asp313 is
included in this hydrogen bonding network. Theside-chain atoms of residue Asp194, which acts as
the catalytic nucleophile, also forms a hydrogen
bond with the O6 atom of the glucose residue boundin subsite −1. The distance between C1 of the glucose
unit and Asp192OD1 is close to 3.1 Å. The side-chain
atoms of the mutated catalytic acid residue Gln236are in close contact with the O4 atom of the scissilebond, at a distance of 3.2 Å. This configuration of the
glucose residue bound to subsite −1 is conserved
within the entire α-amylase family enzymes.
19In
addition, three hydrogen bonds were formed in the
side chains of Asp60 and Arg398 and the glucose in
subsite −1, in which the non-reducing end of the
substrate is identified. The side chains of Asp60 and
Arg398 make a salt-bridge with each other and
engage in hydrogen bonds with the O4 atom of theglucose unit bound in subsite −1. At subsite +1, the
side chains of Lys275 and Glu371 form hydrogen
bonds with the O2 and O3 atoms of the glucoseresidue. Moreover, the side chains of Phe139, Phe158and Trp238 make hydrophobic contacts with the
same glucose unit. Notably, the reducing end
glucose has no hydrogen bond with the enzyme,and only a few hydrophobic interactions between
the side chains of Trp238 and Ile138.
The binding mode of Tris to the active site of the
native S. mutans DGase is different from that in a
psychrophilic α-amylase from Alteromonas halo-
planctis,
32and in a chimeric α-amylase from Bacillus
licheniformis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens .33The
amino group of Tris has only one hydrogen bondwith catalytic residue Asp194, while many hydrogen
bonds were found in the other structures mentioned
above. All of the hydroxy groups of the Tris moleculeare involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with
surrounding residues. The O2 and O3 atoms of Tris
are situated at the same place as the O4 and O6 atomsof the non-reducing end glucose residue of IG3bound to E236Q mutant. Also, a glycerol molecule is
found at subsite +1 in the native structure and the O3
atom bonds with Lys275 and Glu371 in a way similarto that seen for the E236Q –IG3 complex.
One striking observation is that a row of water
molecules was found at the bottom of the active sitepocket. This line of water molecules connects the
active site pocket and the surface of the enzyme.
Identical paths were found in both of the structuresof the native enzyme and the E236Q –IG3 complex.
A close-up view of this path for the E236Q –IG3
complex is shown in Fig. 4 . This path is located near
Asp60 and Arg398, which form a salt-bridge andbind the non-reducing terminus of bound substrate.
These three water molecules are designated from the
inner entrance of this path toward the outer entranceas Wat1 through Wat3. The distances between these
water molecules are 3.11 Å and 3.16 Å, respectively.
Both Wat1 and Wat2 are bound to Asp60 OD1. Wat1also forms a hydrogen bond with Arg398 NH2 and
Arg402 NH2, and contacts the O3 and O4 atoms of
the glucose residue in subsite −1. Wat2 is bound by
Asn61 ND2, Asp369 OD1, Arg398 NH1 and Arg402
NH1. Wat3 forms hydrogen bonds with the main-
chain nitrogen atom of Ile370 and the main-chaincarbonyl oxygen atoms of Asp59 and Asp368. A

Discussion
Substrate specificity of α-1,6 linkage-hydrolyzing
enzymes
The IG3 substrate was bound and recognized by
the enzyme through an extensive network of
hydrogen bonds, as mentioned above. The arrange-ment of amino acid residues at subsite −1 is common
within the α-amylase family of enzymes. Therefore,
the differences in specificity for α-1,4 or α-1,6
linkages among α-amylase family members are
thought to have originated from the structure at
subsite +1 or subsite +2. To compare the differencesbetween recognition of substrates having α-1,4 or α-
1,6 linkages, the models at the active site and bound
substrate in DGase, and in α-amylase from Bacillus
subtilis
13(PDB ID 1bag) are shown in Fig. 5 . Four
hydrogen bonds from Lys275 and Glu371 to the O2
and O3 atoms of the glucose residue bound to
subsite +1 were observed in the substrate –enzyme
complex structure of DGase. In the structures of
many α-amylases, there is a hydrogen bond to the
O2 atom of this glucose residue from a His residue insubsite +1.
5,10,13However, the orientations of these
bonds are not the same as those shown in Fig. 5 . The
side chains of Lys275 and Glu371 of DGase make
hydrogen bonds with the glucose residue from theleft in the figure, while His180 of α-amylase from B.
subtilis bind the residue from the right-hand side.13
Consequently, the location of subsite +1 for these
enzymes is different, and the orientations of
glucosidic linkages between glucose units in sub-
sites +1 and +2 are opposite. The hydrogen bonds atsubsite +1 in DGase appear to stretch the scissile
bond across the cleavage site. With these hydrogenbonds, the conformation of the α-1,6-glucosidic
linkage seen here for S. mutans DGase bound across
the cleavage site is similar to that seen for α-1,4
linkages bound to α-amylases. The torsion angle ϕ
in the scissile bond of bound IG3 in DGase is 43°,which is not much different from the equivalentangles O5-O1-O4-C4 of maltoheptaose bound to AS
(33°),
34and of maltopentaose bound to α-amylase
(26°),13and of maltotetraose bound to neopullula-
nase (34° and 43°).20The positions of the C1, O6 and
C6 atoms of the scissile α-1,6-linkage seen here are
identical with those of the C1, O4 and C4 atoms of α-
1,4 linkage bound to α-amylase from B. subtilis .T h e
consequence is that the lone pair of the O6 atom in
the glucosidic linkage faces the acidic hydrogenatom of Glu236 of wild-type DGase and thereby
reduces the proton-transfer energy barrier during
catalysis in a manner similar to that seen for AS.16

comparison with the structure of the substrate –
enzyme complex of α-amylase from B. subtilis .13
Bulky hydrophobic residues are conserved in
O16G, isoamylase and pullulanase, which all
hydrolyze α-1,6-glucosidic linkages ( Table 2 ). In
contrast, there is a relatively small residue at thisposition in most α-amylases, which specifically
hydrolyze α-1,4 linkages. The bound α-1,6 linked
substrate has a hydrophobic contact with the Valresidue. This interaction would provide an attrac-tive force that is favorable for the α-1,6 linked
substrate binding. Therefore, Val195 or bulky
hydrophobic residues found in other enzymesacting on α-1,6 linkages would make a significant
contact for substrate specificity with the scissile α-
1,6 linkage of the bound substrate. Besides, theseresidues may cause steric hindrance to the binding
ofα-1,4 linked substrates. If the α-1,4 linked
substrate observed in the structure of the α-
amylase from B. subtilis

the active site of DGase while maintaining the

bound conformation, Val195 appears to clash with
the O3 atom of the glucose moiety at subsite +1 (thedistance between those atoms being about 1 Å).
Recognition of the non-reducing end of
substrate
In the substrate –enzyme complex, the O4 atom of
the non-reducing end glucose residue of bound IG3forms hydrogen bonds to the side-chain atoms of
Asp60 and Arg398. These two residues also form a
salt-bridge with each other. An equivalent salt-bridge is found in the structures of O16G, AS and SP,
which all have pocket-shaped active sites like
DGase. Moreover, identical hydrogen bondsbetween enzymes and their substrates have been
observed in the substrate –enzyme complex struc-
tures of AS
16and SP.35In the exo-type enzymes, such
as DGase, O16G, AS and SP, recognition of the non-reducing end seems to be accomplished predomi-
nantly by these interactions. Although hydrogen
atoms are not visible in the present X-ray analysis,the hydrogen bonding network including hydrogen
atoms can be predicted as follows. The OD2 atom of
Asp60 will attract the hydrogen atom of O4(denoted as H4) in the non-reducing end glucose,
and the NH2 group of Arg398 will bind with the O4
atom of the glucose unit from the opposite direction.Because Asp60 orients the H4 atom of the substrate,Arg398 can approach the O4 atom without hin-
drance. Besides, if all of these atoms are in the sameplane, attractive forces between the enzyme and
substrate will be enhanced, since the bond distances
are minimal. A similar arrangement was observed inthe structure of maltotetraose-forming exo-amy-lase.
9In this structure, the OD1 atom of Asp160
and the main-chain nitrogen of Gly158 at subsite −4
bind to the H4 and O4 atoms of the non-reducingend glucose residue of bound substrate, respec-
tively. For strict recognition of the substrate, the H4
and O4 atoms of the non-reducing end glucoseresidue of the substrate are bound by appropriate
atoms. These specific hydrogen bonds confer selec-
tivity and may enable high-affinity binding of thenon-reducing end glucose residue to the binding site
ofexo-type glycosidase.
A water drain for the active site pocket
A row of water molecules that connects the pocket
with the outside of the enzyme was observed at thebottom of the active site pocket ( Fig. 4 ). An identical
row of water molecules is seen in the structures of
O16G, AS and SP, which also all have a pocket-shaped active site. As far as we are aware, a similar
path of water molecules has not been reported for α-
amylases. The level of amino acid sequence identityof DGase with these other enzymes, O16G, AS and

SP, is not high in all cases. The amino acid identities
(similarities) are 51.7% (68.2%), 15.6% (27.2%) and15.4% (27.3%), respectively. Despite such varying
degrees of identity (similarity), these enzymes all
share an identical water path. So, it is possible thatthe water path has an important role in the enzyme
reaction, and we believe that the path may affect
substrate binding. When a substrate enters into anactive site pocket, water molecules within the pocket
must be displaced from their binding sites. If an
active site pocket has only one entrance, watermolecules in the pocket may be forced out through
the entrance when a substrate enters. From the
structure of the DGase substrate –enzyme complex,
the active site pocket appears so tight that thereappears to be no space to accommodate both the
incoming substrate and outgoing water molecules.
Therefore, the active site pocket could have anotherpath for draining the water molecules from the
active site. These water molecules could be pushed
out from the pocket through the drain by theincoming substrate. We conclude that the water
path at the bottom of the active site pocket may
work as the water drain. The role of the water drainshould be as follows. First, water molecules will bebound to their stable position in the active site
pocket. When the substrate comes into the active
site pocket, the bound water molecules in thepocket could be forced out through the water
drain located at the bottom of the active site pocket
by the incoming substrate. Finally, the water mole-cules are drained out from the active site pocket
when the incoming substrate is bound tightly to theenzyme.
Comparison with oligo-1,6-glucosidase
Although DGase shares 52% amino acid sequence
identity with O16G, their preference for substratesof different lengths is known. Of several isomaltoo-
ligosaccharides, isomaltotriose is the best substrate
for both enzymes. If substrates are longer than threeresidues, the k
cat/Kmvalues for processing these
longer substrates by O16G are reduced con-
siderably.26Nevertheless, DGase does hydrolyze
relatively longer isomaltooligosaccharides anddextran.
24In our previous study, the significant
role of Trp238 and the short β→αloop 4 of DGase in
chain-length preference was described.24The
mutants in which Trp238 was replaced by Ala, Pro
and Asn, and a chimeric enzyme in which the β→α
loop 4 (Lys201 –Asn210) was exchanged for the
corresponding parts of B. subtilis O16G (Lys206-
Asn229), had lower preferences for long-chain
substrates than the native enzyme. To clarify, froma structural point of view, the different preferencesof DGase and O16G for substrates of different
lengths, we have compared the crystal structures
of these two enzymes using the program Chimera.

The residues that are important for substrate
binding at subsite −1 are almost identical, as
shown in Fig. 6 . Since the positions of the Lys andTable 2. Multiple sequence alignment of the amino-acid sequences around Val195 of Streptococcus mutans dextran

The catalytic nucleophile and the amino acid corresponding to Val195 of dextran glucosidase are indicated by underlined and bold letters,
respectively. CGTase, cyclodextrin glucanotransferase; iGT, isocyclomaltooligosaccharide glucanotransferase; CmmA, 6-maltosyltrans-ferase; MTSase, maltooligosyltrehalose synthase; MTHase, maltooligosyltrehalose hydrolase.919 Crystal Structures of Dextran Glucosidase
Glu residues in subsite +1 are identical in DGase
(K275 and E371) and O16G (K293 and E387), similarhydrogen bonding networks would be formed insubsite +1 of these two enzymes. Trp238 of DGase
and Phe281 of O16G are found in similar positions.
These residues would form the subsite +1 of DGaseand O16G, respectively. The side chain of Trp238
makes a hydrophobic contact with the glucosidic
linkage spanning subsites +1 and +2, while Phe281may not interact with the identical glucosidic
linkage because the location of the side chain is not
appropriate for contact with the linkage. Moreover,the conformation of the long-chain substrate bound
to O16G should be different from the conformation
when bound to DGase because amino acid residuesSer222, His224 and Met228 on the β→αloop 4 of
O16G will clash with the glucose unit in subsite +2.
Therefore, Trp238 of DGase would confer favorable
recognition of substrate in subsites +1 and +2, whichare favorable for binding longer substrates, while
the interactions of longer-chain substrates with the
residues of the β→αloop 4 of O16G may prevent
efficient substrate binding.
Materials and Methods
Preparation and purification
Recombinant DGase with a His tag was produced in E.
coliBL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Stratagene, USA) contain-ing the expression plasmid derived from pET23d (Novagen,
Germany) as described.37Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyrano-
side was added (0.1 mM) to the cultures, and cells were
cultured for another 24 h at 18 °C. Recombinant DGase waspurified from cells harvested from 1 l of culture broth by Ni-chelating Sepharose column chromatography as de-
scribed.
35The enzyme was eluted with buffer A (20 mM
sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.2) containing 300 mM imida-zole, and dialyzed against buffer A. The enzyme waspurified to homogeneity using DEAE Toyopearl column
chromatography. The enzyme was eluted using a linear
gradient (0 –500 mM) of NaCl in buffer A. Purified DGase
was dialyzed against 0.5×buffer A. The mutant DGase
(E236Q) was generated by megaprimer PCR,
38using the
wild-type DGase expression plasmid as template and anantisense primer: 5 ′-TGCTCCCCAAGTTTGCCCCA-
CAGTCAG-3 ′to introduce the desired mutation. The gene
was inserted into pET23d. The desired mutation and correct
sequence of the inserted DNA was verified. Production ofthe E236Q in E. coli and purification were done as for the
wild type.
Crystallization and data collection
Crystallization and data collection of uncomplexed
native DGase were performed by the hanging-drop,vapor-diffusion method at 20 °C as described.
37The
reservoir solution was 100 mM Tris –HCl buffer (pH 7.5)
containing 120 mg/ml of polyethylene glycol 6000 and200 mM calcium chloride. DGase was dissolved in 0.5×
buffer A at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Crystallization
droplets were prepared by mixing protein solution andreservoir solution to a final volume of 8 μl at a ratio of 5:3
(v/v). The E236Q mutant and IG3 were co-crystallized to
Fig. 6. Comparison of substrate binding by DGase (a) and O16G (b). The IG3 molecule bound to DGase is
superimposed on the structure of O16G. Stick models of DGase in green and O16G in magenta. Bound IG3 molecules areshown in cyan. The subsite numbers are denoted in cyan.920 Crystal Structures of Dextran Glucosidase
prepare crystals of the DGase –IG3 complex. The reservoir
solution in this co-crystallization was the same as thatused for native DGase, with a concentration of IG3 in thecrystallization droplet of 25 mM. For data collection under
cryogenic conditions, crystals were soaked in a cryo-
protectant solution of 100 mM Tris –HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mg/
ml of polyethylene glycol 6000, 200 mM calcium chloride
and 370 mg/ml of glycerol. For crystals of the DGase –IG3
complex, 25 mM IG3 was added.
Crystals were flash-frozen in a stream of cold nitrogen
gas (100 K) just before data collection. The intensity data of
native and substrate-complexed crystals were collected
using an R-AXIS IV
++image-plate detector with CuK α
radiation from a Rigaku ultra X 18 rotating-anodegenerator equipped with an Osmic mirror system. All
data collection was performed at 100 K. Diffraction data
sets were processed using the programs Mosflm39and
SCALA in the CCP4 suite.40The data collection statistics
are summarized in Table 3 .
Structure determination and crystallographic
refinement
The native structure was determined at a resolution of
2.2 Å by the molecular replacement method using the
structure of O16G as a search model with the programAMoRe41in the CCP4 suite. The substrate –enzyme
complex structure was also solved at 2.2 Å resolution but
using the native structure as a search model. All model
building and manual mode corrections were carried outusing the programs CNS42and COOT.43The stereochem-
istry of the models was verified using the program
PROCHECK.44The refinement statistics are given in Table 3 .Protein Data Bank accession codes
The atomic coordinates and structure factors of the free
DGase and the E236Q –IG3 complex have been deposited
in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 2zic and
2zid, respectively.
