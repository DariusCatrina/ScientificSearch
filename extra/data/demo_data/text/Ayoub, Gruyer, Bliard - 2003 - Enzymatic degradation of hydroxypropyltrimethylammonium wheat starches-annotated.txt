1. Introduction
Chemicallymodiﬁedstarcheshavefoundnumerousappli-
cations in food and non-food industries. Functional groupsare introduced on the macromolecules by reaction on thehydroxyls groups [1,2]. Cationic starches are widely used
in industrial paper-making process [3], where they bind to
negatively charged cellulose ﬁbres by ionic association.
Hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium (HPTMA) is one of
the most widely used cationic modifying groups. In indus-trial process, the chemical modiﬁcation is performed eitherin solution or by dry process [2]. In a previous paper we
described an alternative chemical modiﬁcation procedurein microhydric molten medium using glycerol-plasticisedstarch[4].
Hydrolysis has been widely used to study the molecular
architecture of complex carbohydrate polymers. Hydrolysis

enzymatic degradation [6,7]. Enzymatic degradation is the
base of the largest starch transformation industries. Hamdiand Ponchel [8]have studied the inﬂuence and the sensi-
tivity to enzymatic degradation of starch microspheres with/H9251-amylase.Brandametal. [9]describethe /H9251-and/H9252-amylase
activities on starch.
Several research groups have investigated the enzymatic
degradationofstarchinordertodeterminethelocationofthechemical modiﬁcations. Based on the results of speciﬁc en-zymatic degradations, Kavitha and BeMiller [10]concluded
that hydroxypropyl modiﬁcation was preferentially locatedin amorphous regions as opposed to crystalline regions.Steeneken and Woortman [11]reported that the polymers
obtained by methylation of granular starches were substi-tuted in a more block-wise manner, while starch polymersmethylated in solution were substituted in a more randomfashion.
We used a similar selective degradation procedure to
investigate structural differences between cationic starches

obtained by different processes. This paper describes the
results of enzymatic degradation /H9251,/H9252-amylase, amyloglu-
cosidase and isoamylase on cationic starches with variousdegrees of substitution, obtained from both dry process andmolten medium.
/H9252-Amylase is an exoenzyme, which degrades /H9251-(1-4)-
d-glucopyranoside molecules by cleaving maltose units
from the non-reducing ends. The action of the enzymeis stopped by the presence of /H9251-(1-6) branch or substi-
tuting groups on /H9251-(1-4) glucose residues. The resulting
products of /H9252-amylase actions on polysaccharides macro-
molecules are maltose and /H9252-limit dextrins. Amyloglucosi-
dase is also an exoenzyme cleaving /H9251-(1-4) bounds from
the non-reducing end of the polysaccharides chain withliberation of glucose This enzyme hydrolyses /H9251-(1-6) as
well, but at a much lower rate. Isoamylase speciﬁcallycleaves branching /H9251-(1-6) bonds (5% in wheat amylopectin
and less than 1% in amylose) releasing linear poly- /H9251-(1-4)
chains from starch branched polysaccharides. /H9251-Amylase
is an endoenzyme cleaving /H9251-(1-4) bonds of starches with
liberation of linear oligosaccharides and /H9251-(1-6) branched
dextrins.Thehydrolysisproductsofstarcharecharacterisedby their reducing power, measured as dextrose equivalent.
A comparative degradation kinetics study between modi-
ﬁed and non-modiﬁed starches obtained in molten mediumwas undertaken in order to determine the inﬂuence of thechemical modiﬁcation on the enzyme afﬁnity by determina-tion of the constants K
MandVmax.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Polysaccharides samples
Native wheat starch (12.5% humidity) was provided by
Chamtor, Bazancourt, France. Commercial cationic wheatstarches synthesised by dry process with various degrees ofsubstitution[(DS)0.015,0.05,0.08and0.18]wereprovidedby Crespel and Dieters, Ibbenbüren, Germany. The fused,non-modiﬁed and hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium mod-iﬁed starches, obtained in glycerol–water plasticised moltenmedium as previously described [4], are listed in Table 1.
The plasticiser ratio was 30% in all formulations. They aredivided into three categories as follows: group A (15% w/wglycerol and 15% w/w water), group B (7% w/w glyceroland 23% w/w water) and group C (30% water).

2.2. Viscosity measurement
Viscositymeasurementwascarriedoutat25( +/−0.1)◦C
with a 100mm length and 1mm diameter capillary using anAVS 400 semi-automatic viscosimeter from Shott, Mainz,Germany.Theproductsweresuspendedina1MKOHsolu-tionfor24hfollowedbymagneticstirringsforanother24h.KOHwasusedtolimittheelectrostaticinteractionsbetweenthe polyelectrolyte chains. The solutions were then ﬁlteredat 0.2 /H9262m. The concentrations of the solutions were in the
1–5g/l range. Five consecutive measurements were carriedout on each sample. The measurements were performed atﬁve different concentrations starting with the lower. The re-sults were within 3% relative accuracy.
2.3. Substitution degree
Modiﬁed cationic starches and /H9252-limit dextrins are char-
acterised by their DS corresponding to the average num-ber of hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium cationic groups,branched through ether bonds per glucose monomer. DSwere determined by proton NMR or elementary analysis aspreviously described [4].
2.4. Measurement of reducing sugar
The enzymatic hydrolysis rates were determined by the
colorimetric method developed by Park–Johnson and modi-ﬁed by Porro et al. [12]; maltose, /H9252-limit dextrins and linear
oligosaccharides were analysed by measuring the reducingpower obtained after sample degradation.
A1 0/H9262l aliquot of the solution containing the reducing
sugar (2 /H9262l in case of maltose) was added to 10 /H9262lo f1N
NaOH and 380 /H9262l of distilled water. 200 /H9262l of a 0.1% w/v
potassium ferricyanide solution and 200 /H9262l of a 0.065%
w/v potassium cyanide, 0.92% w/v sodium bicarbonate and0.48% w/v sodium carbonate solution were added to thismixture. The resulting mixtures were incubated at 100
◦C
for 15min, then left for 10min at room temperature beforeadding 1000 /H9262l of 0.3% w/v ammonium ferric sulphate in
a 50mM sulphuric acid solution. 15min after the additionof this last solution, the absorption was recorded at 715nm

with a spectrophotometer UVIKON, Milan, Italy. The re-
sults were obtained with 5% accuracy.
The glucose was measured using the Trinder enzymatic
method by adding 1ml of the Trinder reagent (Sigma Di-agnostics, St. Louis, MO, USA) to a 150 /H9262l aliquot of the
mixture to analyse. The absorption was recorded at 505nmwith 5% accuracy.
2.5.β-Amylase degradation
Twenty-ﬁve milligrams of samples were dispersed in
10ml of pH 4.8, 50mM sodium acetate buffer stabilisedwith 0.01% w/v NaN
3. Ten units of powdered /H9252-amylase
(Sigma, A 7130) were added and the mixture was incu-bated at 20
◦C for 24h. The enzyme was then inactivated
by heating the samples at 100◦C for 15min. The carbo-
hydrate content of each fraction was determined by thePark–Johnson method as described above.
2.6. Glucose liberation
Twenty-ﬁve milligrams of samples were dispersed in
25ml of pH 4.5, 50mM sodium acetate buffer stabilizedwith 0.01% w/v NaN
3. Ten units of amyloglucosidase
(Sigma, A 7420) were then added, and the mixture was in-cubated at 55
◦C for 3h. The enzyme was then inactivated
at 100◦C for 15min. Analysis of the liberated glucose was
determined by the Trinder method as described above butusing normalized glucose solutions.
2.7. Isoamylase degradation
Cationicwheatstarchesfrombothdryprocessandmolten
medium were debranched using isoamylase (Sigma, I 2758)in a buffered solution, stabilised with 0.01% w/v NaN
3.
25mg samples were dispersed in 10ml of pH 3.5, 0.2Msodium acetate buffer. Ten units of isoamylase units wereadded, and the mixture was incubated for 24h at 45
◦C. The
enzymewastheninactivatedbyheatingthereactionmixtureat 100
◦C for 15min. The reducing power was determined
foreachsampleusingthePark–Johnsonmethodasdescribedabove.
2.8. Enzyme kinetics and estimation of the K
Mand V max
Kinetics were analysed on native, non-modiﬁed melted
starch and two samples from group A A-1 (DS 0.02) andA-5 (DS 0.13) for /H9252-,/H9251-, and isoamylase. The incubation
timeforeachsamplewasdeterminedusing0.1and0.25en-zyme units with 0.6% substrate. The afﬁnity constant andthe catalysis rate of the enzymes was then determined foreach substrate by measuring the reaction evolution after en-zyme pre-incubation, using 0.1 enzyme unit at different ini-tial concentrations (0.2, 0.6, 1 and 2% w/v).
ThereducingpowerwasdeterminedbythePark–Johnson
method as described above. The kinetic parameters ( V
max:maximal rate and K M: Michaelis constant ) were obtained
usingthe LineweaverandBurk modeofrepresentation [13].
The values of −1/KM, representing the enzyme afﬁnity for
the substrate, were obtained from the graphs where thecurves intercept the 1/[S] axis .The values of −1/V
maxwere
obtainedfromthegraphswherethecurvesinterceptthe1/ U
axis. For each series of amylolytic degradation, measure-ments were repeated at low, high and mean DS with a rela-tive difference of less than 10%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1.β-Amylolytic degradation
The results of the /H9252-amylase degradation on cationic
starches from dry process and molten medium showed thatthe two starch types followed two different degradationmodes.
The enzymatic degradation ratio obtained with the dry
process products displayed a linear decrease as DSs in-creased, suggesting that the increase in the number ofcationic groups decreases the enzymatic degradability asexpected from a regular modiﬁcation pattern. The resultsof group A starches enzymatic degradation ( Figs. 1 and 2 )
show that the levels of degradability were lower than theones obtained with the dry process samples at the lowestDSs (33% less degradation than with non-modiﬁed starchesat DS 0.02). This result suggests that some of the chemicalgrafting happens on external /H9251-(1-4) chains. The enzymatic
action was not affected when the number of cationic groupswere increased up to 0.13. The degradation level remainedclose to 30% on a wide DS range (0.02–0.13), decreasingdown to 10% only at DS greater than 0.13. This suggeststhat the subsequent modiﬁcations occur almost exclusivelyon the internal chains beyond the initial modiﬁcation.These results indicate that the chemical modiﬁcation inmolten medium exhibits a more speciﬁc pattern than in dryprocess.

3.1.1. NMR spectra
TheNMRspectraofsampleA-5(DS0.13)andthecorre-
sponding /H9252-limit dextrin are shown in Fig. 3. The spectrum
of the A-5 limit dextrin ( Fig. 3B), shows an increase of the
integration values for both /H9251-(1-6) branched glucose H-1
and HPTMA protons as compared to the values from A-5sample spectrum ( Fig. 3A), this increase being proportional
to the degradation ratio.
The DS value is obtained by comparing either the rel-
ative integrations of the quaternary trimethylammoniumprotons (nine protons at 3.35ppm) or from the integralvalues of the C H
(OH)proton from the HPTMA group at
4.6ppm, with those of the anydroglucose anomeric protons(one proton, from 4.8 to 5.9ppm). The ratio of 2-O- to(3-O+6-O)-substitution ( Tables 2 and 3 ) was calculated by
comparing the integral value of the 2-O-substituted anhy-droglucose residue H1 signal shifted downﬁeld to 5.77ppmwith the one of HPTMA protons signals, conﬁrming boththedegradationlevelandtheretentionofallcationicgroupson the /H9252-limit dextrin.

The viscosity measurements were performed on the
/H9252-limit dextrins in order to observe the inﬂuence of the
/H9252-amylase degradation on the molecular size. Fig. 4dis-
plays the intrinsic viscosity values of various starch sam-ples: native (N), fused under standard conditions (M) andtwo cationic starch samples with low and high DS (A-1 andA-5)withthecorresponding /H9252dextrins.Theresultsindicate
that the melting process causes a 63% drop in viscositywhereas /H9252amylolytic degradation results in only a 23%
drop in viscosity for both non-modiﬁed starch samples.Chemically modiﬁed /H9252dextrins display slightly higher val-
ues depending on the DS (18% for A-1 and 14% for A-5).

3.2. Amyloglucosidase degradation
A 67% degradation value was obtained by action of amy-
loglucosidase on both unmodiﬁed native and fused starch(Figs. 5 and 6 ).
As for the /H9252-amylolysis, the amyloglucosidase degrada-
tion of cationic starches obtained by dry process display agradual decrease with increasing modiﬁcation, whereas thegroupAstarchdegradationislower(48%versus65%)atlowDSs and is constant up to DS 0.13.

cose of the external chains.
3.3. Inﬂuence of plasticising conditions
The inﬂuence of three different plasticiser amounts and
types in the molten-medium chemical modiﬁcation on theenzymatic degradation was studied on both exoenzymes(/H9252-amylase and amyloglucosidase). Both glycerol and wa-
ter plasticise the formulation. Three formulations were used(Table1)A-1,A-4,B-1,B-2,C-1andC-2.ThetwoDSval-
ues (0.02 and 0.045) were chosen because they correspondtotheextremeDSvaluesshowingasimilardegradationratioin bothFigs. 2 and 5 . The degradation ratios obtained in all
formulations are at the same level, showing that the cationicgroupdistributionwithinthemacromoleculesisverysimilarin all molten medium products.
3.4.α-Amylase degradation
Theenzymaticdegradationofnative,melted,groupAand
dry process starches using /H9251-amylase was undertaken. The
results are displayed in Fig. 7. The degradation proﬁles for
both dry process and melted cationic starches were strik-ingly similar to the ones obtained with both exoenzymes(/H9252-amylaseandamyloglucosidase).AnincreaseofDS,from
0.02to0.13,didnotseemtoinﬂuencetheenzymaticdegrad-ability level of molten medium cationic starches. But in-creasing the DS from 0.13 to 0.16 led to a 50% drop in thedegradation level. Since /H9251-amylase is an endoenzyme de-
grading regular /H9251-(1-4) chains, this result tends to indicate
that in molten medium, the linear parts of internal chainsare less susceptible to chemical modiﬁcation and that thesemodiﬁcations are concentrated near the branching zones.
3.5. Isoamylase degradation

But for DSs higher than 0.05, thereappears to be no further inﬂuence on the enzymatic activityin the studied DS range. This binary degradation mode forless than and greater than DS 0.05 using isoamylase seemsto show that at low DSs ( <0.05), the chemical modiﬁcation

3.6.1. β-Amylase degradation
TheKMforbothnon-modiﬁednativeandmeltedstarches
were similar (0.11 and 0.095%). KMvalues of group A
starches are slightly higher, suggesting a slight decrease ofthe enzyme afﬁnity for the modiﬁed substrate. Furthermore,when the results obtained for starch modiﬁed in moltenmedium are compared with those of the reference (meltedstarch), it can be noted that the cationisation, though weak,seems to affect the afﬁnity of the enzyme for its substrate.There was a 40% increases of V

that the chemical modiﬁcation takes place preferentiallywithinthemacromoleculeandnotatthenon-reducingends.The melting process does not appear to have a noticeableinﬂuence on the V

by dry process and under molten conditions displayed dis-tinct degradation proﬁles. The results obtained with exoen-zymes show that the chemical modiﬁcation ﬁrst happens onsome external /H9251-(1-4) chains with a more speciﬁc pattern
in molten medium products. With the former, much lowerdegradabilitylevelswereobtainedatthelowestDSs.Never-theless, these degradability levels remain constant until DS0.13,indicatingthatfurtherchemicalmodiﬁcationsoccuroninternalchainstowardsthereducingend,exclusivelybeyondthe initial modiﬁcations. /H9251-Amylase degradation displayed
identical proﬁles, suggesting that regular /H9251-(1-4) internal
as well as external chains, are less susceptible to chemicalmodiﬁcation.Chemicalmodiﬁcationhadaverystronginﬂu-ence on isoamylase activity, particularly in molten mediumproducts, showing that the grafted groups are located inthe close vicinity of the /H9251-(1-6) branched glucose residues.
Chemical modiﬁcation had an impact on the kinetic pa-rameters of each enzyme ( K
MandVmax), particularly on
/H9251-amylase. Further investigation into the structural charac-
terisationofcationicstarches,usingNMRspectroscopy,arein process to determine the exact location of these graftedgroups.
