The synthesis of chiral compounds is a challenge in chemistry. 
Enzymes are often superior to non-enzymatic catalysts concerning 
effectiveness, enantioselectivity and environmental friendliness. 
However, although natural enzymes are versatile biocatalysts 
catalyzing a wide range of chemical reactions, they are evolved 
towards the needs of their natural role. Thus, they are not available 
for many of the important conversions and substrates relevant for 
industry and do not fulfill the manifold requirements on enzymes 
used in industrial biotechnology. Enzymes should have high activity as 
well as high specificity and enantioselectivity towards frequently very 
challenging substrates. Moreover, they need to be stable during 
storage and resist a variety of - sometimes harsh - reaction conditions 
such as elevated temperature, extreme pH, high substrate / product 
concentrations and organic solvents. Thus, to fulfill all these criteria 
enzymes are nowadays routinely optimized by enzyme engineering for 
application in organic synthesis [1]. The published examples are 
uncountable and the interested readers are referred to numerous 
excellent reviews and book chapters available on protein engineering 
and the application of engineered enzymes in organic synthesis 
[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].  
This article specifically reviews rational approaches for enzyme 
engineering and de novo  enzyme design involving structure-based 
methods developed in recent years for improvement of the enzymes’ 
performance, broadened substrate range, and creation of novel 
functionalities to obtain products with high added value for industrial 
applications. 
 
Current status of protein engineering 
 
Generally there are two main strategies for protein engineering: 
directed  evolution  and  rational  design,  which can be combined to  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 semi-rational design or focused directed (designed) evolution 
(Figure1). 
Directed evolution can be achieved by two major approaches, 
either by randomly recombining a set of related sequences (e.g. gene 
shuffling), or by introducing random changes in single protein 
sequences (e.g. error-prone PCR). The advantage of directed 
evolution is that no structural information is needed and that 
variations at unexpected positions distant from the active site can be 
introduced. However, usually the changes are small and several rounds 
of evolution have to be applied and thus a high number of variants 
have to be screened, which is time and labor consuming and requires 
cheap, fast and reliable high-throughput assays.  
With the availability of an increasing number of protein structures or 
reliable models, biochemical data and computational methods, 
enzyme engineering is developing more and more from random 
approaches (directed evolution) to semi-rational or rational (data-
driven) design. In rational design biochemical data, protein structures 
and molecular modeling data are evaluated to propose mutations, 
which are introduced by site-specific mutagenesis. One of the 
advantages of a rational design approach is an increased probability of 
beneficial mutations and a significant reduction of the library size and 
thus less effort and time has to be applied for the screening of the 
library. This is especially advantageous if no high-throughput assay 
system is available. 
Semi-rational design combines advantages of rational and 
random protein design creating smaller smarter libraries based on 
knowledge derived from biochemical and/or structural data [10]. An 
example for a semi-rational approach is CASTing (combinatorial 
active site saturation test), which uses the information derived from 
e.g. structural data to identify amino acids in interesting regions (e.g. 
active site), which are then mutated randomly or by site-saturation 
mutagenesis one by one or in combination [11,12,13,8]. Random 
combination of mutations or correlated mutations at targeted 
positions can result in synergistic effects that might have been missed 
in single site-specific mutagenesis. However, these combinatorial 
approaches increase the library sizes tremendously and various 
computational methods have been developed in recent years, that help 
to decrease the library size by screening of virtual libraries and 
eliminating mutations predicted to be unfavorable for the protein fold 
[14,15,16,17,18].

Abstract: Enzymes are an attractive alternative in the asymmetric syntheses of chiral building blocks. To meet the requirements of 
industrial biotechnology and to introduce new functionalities, the enzymes need to be optimized by protein engineering. This 
article sp ecifically reviews rational approaches for enzyme engineering and de novo  enzyme design involving structure -based 
approaches developed in recent years for improvement of the enzymes’ performance, broadened substrate range, and creation of 
novel functionali ties to obtain products with high added value for industrial applications.

Learning from natural diversity and conservation  
 
In structure-guided consensus approaches sequence-based and 
structural data are combined. Generally, the consensus approach is 
based on the hypothesis that consensus amino acids of a sequence 
alignment contribute more than average to the fitness of the protein 
than the non-consensus amino acids. They proved to be favorable for 
the protein during natural evolution during which unfit variants are 
eliminated. Thus, changing non-consensus amino acids to consensus 
amino acids should improve e.g. thermostability (for details see [19]) . 
A proof of concept was given after several rounds of this method, 
when the unfolding temperature of a fungal phytase was increased by 
more than 30 C to astonishing 90.4 C [20]. This approach was also 
successfully used to increase the thermostability of a cellulosomal 
endoglucanase, Cel8A, from Clostridium thermocellum  14-fold at 
85C without loss of catalytic activity [21]. However, after detailed 
analysis of the mutants, it turned out that of the eight identified 
consensus positions one single mutation (G283P) was sufficient to 
produce a thermostable variant. Glycine to proline mutations have 
been described before to increase the thermostability, however only at 
sites carefully selected [22,23]. Thus, as not all of these consensus 
mutations actually contribute to stability and some might interfere 
with the enzymes’ activity, additional factors should be implemented.  
Structural features, such as the distance to the active site (improvements in stability in most cases require mutations further 
away from the active site, whereas changes of selectivity and activity 
usually target directly the active site), avoiding destabilization of 
helices or breaking existing hydrogen-bonds or salt-bridges, have to be 
considered [24,25,26]. 
By applying this structure-guided consensus approach, Bommarius 
and his group were able to increase the thermal stability of a penicillin 
G acylase (PGA) [25] and a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from 
Bacillus subtilis  [27] by preserving the enzymes’ activities. In both 
cases about 50% of the variants showed increased thermostability. 
The three most stable mutations of GDH were successfully applied to 
two other GDHs from B. thuringiensis  and B. lichenformis . 
Moreover, they showed that the most thermostable variants of GDH 
from B. subtilis  were also more stable in high-salt solutions and 
homogeneous aqueous-organic media [28]. The same group 
combined the consensus approach with the B-fit (B-Factor Iterative 
Test) method to improve the thermostability of an -amino ester 
hydrolase from Xanthomonas campestris  resulting in a quadruple 
mutant (E143H/A275P/N186D/V622I) with 7 C improvement 
and 1.3-fold activity compared to wild-type [29]. In the B-fit method 
positions that display the highest flexibility (highest B-factor) in an 
enzyme’s crystal structure are subjected to site -saturation mutagenesis 
[30,31,32,33]. The library size can be reduced by limiting the 
variation at the chosen positions to amino acids that are frequently 
present in an alignment using a consensus approach. An extension of 
the consensus approach is the combination of a sequence alignment

with phylogenetic trees to identify the consensus sequence of a 
common ancestor [34]. It is thought that this common ancestor 
should be more stable due to the harsh environmental conditions 
during ancient times [35] and in addition this sequence might show 
promiscuous enzyme activity as it displays the turning point towards 
two separate enzymatic activities [36] (see below). Ancestral residues 
can also be introduced into modern sequences thereby combining the 
advantageous properties of the ancient (e.g. thermostability) and the 
modern proteins (e.g. activity, substrate range, selectivity) [37,38].    
 
3DM databases are protein super-family platforms that combine 
different types of protein-related data including structures, multiple 
sequence alignments, conserved amino acids, (correlated) mutations, 
protein-ligand and protein-protein contact information. They are 
linked to literature containing mutations and biochemical data (Figure 
2) [39,40,41]. 3DM databases can be applied for different purposes. 
Based on analysis of a 3DM database containing proteins of the /-
hydrolase fold superfamily, the enantioselectivity (from E = 3.2 to E 
= 80) and activity (up to 240-fold) of an esterase from Pseudomonas 
fluorescens  was improved by mutating four residues near the active 
site [42]. In addition, the thermostability of the same esterase was also 
improved in combination with the B-fit method [43]. Using the same 
database, a variant esterase from Paenibacillus barcinonensis  with 
increased activity and enantioselectivity for the synthesis of tertiary 
alcohols was found [44]. Combination of the B-fit method with a 
3DM database containing sequences of the glucosidase family 13 
helped to identify positions where mutations led to increased thermal 
stability of a sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis  
[45]. This study also revealed a synergistic effect of the two most 
flexible positions, as only pairwise mutations showed the desired 
outcome. In the most successful variant they introduced additional 
salt bridges. Analysis of a 3DM database for FAD-linked oxidases 
revealed, that almost all oxidases in the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase 
(VAO) fold subfamily contain a Gly or a Pro at a certain position, 
whereas other members that do not react with oxygen, have a different 
residue. Changing the corresponding residue in an L-galactono-γ -
lactone dehydrogenase (GALDH) from Ala to Gly resulted in 
increased oxygen reactivity thus converting the dehydrogenase into an 
oxidase [46]. Very recently, a 3DM database for methyltransferases 
helped to identify amino acid residues relevant for catalytic function 
and binding of the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine, which were 
confirmed by mutagenesis analysis [47]. 
 
Another approach to improve the thermostability of proteins uses 
SCHEMA structure-guided recombination. SCHEMA is a 
computational algorithm, which estimates the disruption caused when 
amino acid residues that interact in the structure of a protein are 
recombined in chimeras. Sequences with low sequence similarity can 
be shuffled and the chimeras are rated according to the disruption 
caused [48,49,50]. With this method the thermostabilities of 
cellobiohydrolases class I, cellulases and cytochrome P450s were 
improved [51,52,53]. In addition, chimeric P450s were able to accept 
substrates that were not accepted by the parent protein, thus 
broadening the substrate range [54]. Recently, the thermostability of a 
Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) phenylaceton e 
monooxygenase was combined with the broader substrate range of 
other BVMOs by structure-guided subdomain exchange [55]. 
Interested readers can find more information about ‘ Protein design 
with fragment databases’ in the recent review by Verschueren and 
coauthors [56].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Active site (re)design  
 
Generally, enzymes can be promiscuous concerning their reaction 
conditions (reaction condition promiscuity), their substrate range 
(substrate promiscuity), show an additional activity in the same active 
site (catalytic promiscuity) or due to a second active site (alternate site 
promiscuity) [57]. Some enzymes display a minor catalytic activity 
(accidental catalytic promiscuity) in addition to the main activity in 
the same active site. These low activities can be enhanced by 
mutagenesis and therefore provide a good starting point for protein 
engineering. On the other hand very similar enzymes, which belong to 
the same protein fold, often exhibit different enzyme activities. By 
comparison of the structure and the reaction mechanism of two 
enzymes, amino acids can be identified, the substitution of which 
could switch the catalytic activity of the enzyme (induced catalytic 
promiscuity). Some examples for increasing and introducing 
promiscuous catalytic activities are given below, for more extended 
reviews see [58,59,60,57].  
Based on the postulated reaction mechanism a single point-
mutation was introduced into an arylmalonate decarboxylase from 
Alcaligenes bronchoseptimus  to add a promiscuous racemase activity 
while retaining the decarboxylase activity [61]. Similarly, a detailed 
analysis of the reaction mechanism of the thiamine diphosphate 
dependent pyruvate decarboxylase identified a Glu473 residue, which 
was mutated and resulted in a 100-fold preference for the 
promiscuous   carboligation   reaction  [62].   Hilvert  and  his  group

achieved the introduction of aldolase activity into a PLP-dependent 
racemase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus  (thereby decreasing the 
racemase activity by >1000-fold) by mutation of just one amino acid 
(Y265A) in the active site, which removes a catalytic residue for the 
racemase activity, but creates space for the aldolase substrate [63,64]. 
The aldolase activity was further extended by changing the same 
residue to a lysine [65]. Moreover, three additional mutations in the 
active site changed the preference to the (2R,3R) diastereomer relative 
to the (2R,3S) diastereomer. A double mutation in the active site 
abolished the racemase activity and increased the intrinsic forward 
half transaminase activity 6.6-fold in an alanine racemase from B. 
stearothermophilus  [66]. 
Enzymes with /-hydrolase-fold are one of the largest known 
protein families, including esterases, lipases, amidases, epoxide 
hydrolases (EH), dehalogenases and hydroxynitrile lyases (HNL) 
(Figure 3). Some of them already have intrinsic promiscuous enzyme 
activities [67]. The first example in which a promiscuous activity seemed to be 
increased in an esterase is the perhydrolase activity of an esterase of P. 
fluorescens  [68]. The perhydrolase activity of a single-mutant (L29P) 
apparently increased 28-fold from 0.24 to 6.8 U/mg, while the 
esterase activity decreased 100-fold from 14 to 0.14 U/mg. However, 
different substrates (acetic acid for the perhydrolysis and p-
nitrophenylacetate for the hydrolase reaction) were used for the two 
reactions. Recently, by the use of the same ester substrate, methyl 
acetate, for both reactions, it was shown that mutation L29P actually 
decreased the perhydrolase activity 15-fold and the hydrolysis 3-fold. 
Moreover, experiments revealed that the mutant did not have higher 
selectivity for H 2O2 than for water as it was originally proposed, but 
that in the mutant the acyl-enzyme intermediate with acetic acid is 
formed faster than in the wild-type [69]. 
Both, esterases and some HNLs, belong to the /-hydrolase 
superfamily and have the typical conserved Asp, His and Ser catalytic 
triad in their catalytic site. Although the substrates and the reaction

amidase and perhydrolase share a common mechanism, in which a Ser, which is activated by a His -Asp dyad, s erves as nucleophile. Subsequently, esterase and 
amidase are hydrolyzed by an activated water molecule, whereas in perhydrolases an activated H 2O2 is involved. Haloalkane dehalogenase and epoxide 
hydrolase share a different mechanism, in which an Asp serve s as nucleophile. A water molecule, which is also activated by the His -Asp dyad, hydrolyzes the 
ester bond between Asp and product. In contrast to these reaction mechanisms, in hydroxynitrile lyases no covalent enzyme -substrate intermediate is formed. 
Agai n the catalytic triad is involved, but the activated Ser acts as base and subtracts a proton from the hydroxyl group of the c yanohydrin. Subsequently the 
cyanide is released.

mechanisms are different, two groups managed to introduce HNL 
activity into esterases. Schwab and his group converted the bacterial 
esterase EstC from Burkholderia gladioli  into an HNL; one mutation 
(S276K) was sufficient to generate HNL activity and to abolish 
esterase activity [70]. Kazlauskas and his group switched the plant 
esterase SABP2 activity by just two point mutations (G12T and 
M239K), resulting in an enzyme with strongly reduced esterase 
activity, but clearly detectable HNL activity with racemic 
mandelonitrile (20 mU/mg, k cat/K M = 72 min-1M-1), but with low 
enantioselectivity cleaving ( R)- and ( S)-mandelonitrile with 12.6 and 
15.5 mU/mg, respectively. In the synthesis direction, the ( S)-product 
showed only 20% ee [71]. Comparison of the structures of epoxide 
hydrolases with esterases revealed differing loops at the entrance to 
the active site. Subsequent exchange of the loop of the esterase by an 
epoxide hydrolase loop finally introduced EH activity into an esterase 
from P. fluorescens  (kcat 0.01 s-1, [72]). The best variant showed high 
enantioselectivity (E > 100) for the ( R)-enantiomer of p-nitrostyrene 
oxide. Some esterases already display promiscuous amidase activity. 
However, so far no successful shift in the reaction preference has been 
reported [73]. Very recently, the promiscuous enantioselective ( )-
lactamase activity of (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en -3-one) in the P. 
fluorescens  esterase I was increased 200-fold by the introduction of a 
point mutation (L29P) and the structural and mechanistic 
determinants for the catalytic promiscuity and enantioselectivity were 
identified by molecular modeling [74]. Interestingly, this is the same 
mutation as has been reported to play a role in perhydrolysis reaction 
[68] (see above). These studies together with investigations of Syren 
and Hult on the prerequisites for amide hydrolysis [75] might lead to 
conversion of an esterase into an efficient amidase. 
Lipase B from Candida antarctica  (CAL-B) was analyzed by 
quantum mechanical simulations for the possibility to introduce 
aldolase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ser105 in the active site 
proved that very low activity for an aldol reaction was achieved [76]. 
Interestingly, the S105A variant is also able to catalyze Michael-type 
additions faster than the wild-type [77,78]. It was suggested that the 
mutation of the Ser residue, which is part of the catalytic triad in the 
natural hydrolase activity, disrupts the hydrolase activity with no 
effect on the Michael-type reaction with an ester substrate [79]. 
Recently, docking studies of methyl 2-methyl-2-nitro-5-oxohexanoate 
in CAL-B S105A revealed that theoretically there is no preferred 
binding mode for either the ( R)- or the ( S)-enantiomer in the 
voluminous active site explaining the lack of enantioselectivity [80].  
Despite the increasing number of redesigned active sites to 
introduce or improve promiscuous activities, most of them still lack 
behind natural enzyme activities. Care has also to be taken, that the 
apparent promiscuous reaction de facto stems from enzymatic 
catalysis and is not chemically catalyzed by a prosthetic group only 
[81] or by amino acids not related to an active site (e.g. EstB from B. 
gladioli , [82]) or from an apparent new reaction due to an overlooked 
change of the actual substrate e.g. hydrolysis of substrate prior to the 
measured reaction [83]. Thus, the choice of an appropriate method 
for analysis and proper controls are crucial. 
 
Nowadays substrate docking is a routine method in enzyme 
engineering to carve the active site to improve enzyme activity, 
broaden the substrate scope towards industrially interesting 
compounds and increase or invert enantioselectivity. A few 
representative examples are given in this review. 
In 2005, the ( R)-selective hydroxynitrile lyase from Prunus 
amygdalus  was one of the first lyases to be redesigned by modeling to 
give enzyme variants with improved enantioselectivity (>96%) for the synthesis of ( R)-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyronitrile, which is an 
intermediate of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) 
known as prils [84]. The crystal structure of another hydroxynitrile 
lyase from Manihot esculenta  revealed that a bulky tryptophan at the 
entrance of the active site might be the reason for the preference of 
small substrates, which was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis to 
a small Ala residue resulting in enhanced activity [85,86]. 
Interestingly, mutation of this Trp residue to smaller residues (Ala, 
Met, Phe) was also identified in the highly similar HNL from Hevea 
brasiliensis  by directed evolution (Schwab, unpublished results). 
Other examples concerning engineering of HNLs are given in other 
reviews (e.g. [87, 87b]). Similarly, molecular dynamics simulation and 
structure-based enzyme design identified key functional residues in 
the active site access tunnel of a dehalogenase from Rhodococcus 
rhodochrous  [88]. Substitutions in these positions resulted in variants 
with 32-fold increase of activity towards 1,2,3-trichloropropane 
(TCP). This improvement was shown to originate from changes in 
solvent accessibility of the active site. Analysis of a transition-state 
model of 1-phenyl-1-hexanol in a lipase from Burkholderia cepacia  
proposed three amino acids that might improve the activity and 
enantioselectivity towards secondary alcohols with bulky substituents 
on both sites [89]. Experiments confirmed that indeed a double 
mutant of two of these residues showed high conversion and high 
enantioselectivity (E > 200, compared to E = 5 before). Analysis of 
the structure and molecular modeling allowed the identification of 
amino acids critical for switching the substrate specificity of a 
Drosophila melanogaster  2’-deoxynucleoside kinase from thymidine 
to 3’ -deoxythymidine by side-directed mutagenesis [90]. In an 
approach combining in silico  modeling, site-saturation mutagenesis 
and directed evolution, Savile and coworkers created an -(R)-
transaminase, which is able to convert the bulky-bulky pro-sitagliptin 
ketone (200 g/L) to sitagliptin (an active pharmaceutical ingredient 
API) of  >99.9% ee with 92% yield in 50% DMSO after eleven 
rounds of mutagenesis inserting a total of 27 mutations in the most 
active mutant [91]. The activity for aliphatic amines was improved by 
replacing a bulky tryptophan residue in the active site of an ( S)-
selective -transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis  by a glycine to create a 
larger substrate binding pocket [92]. Using homology models 
Berglund and his group designed variants of originally ( S)-selective -
transaminases from Chromobacterium violaceum  and Arthrobacter 
citreus  that showed improved or reversed enantioselectivity [93,94]. 
For other transaminase engineering approaches see Mathew and Yun 
[95]. By combination of directed and designed evolution (site-
saturation mutagenesis of three amino acids in the active site, that 
have been identified in the structure) of the esterase EstB from B. 
gladioli  the enantioselectivity was inverted [96]. Simultaneous site-
saturation mutagenesis of two residues in the active site of esterase B2 
from B. subtilis  resulted in inverted enantioselectivity from E R > 100 
to E S = 65 [97].  
Many oxidoreductase enzymes are NAD(P)H dependent. In 
pathway engineering of microorganisms used for the production of 
industrially relevant products the balance of cofactor consumption 
and regeneration is essential to obtain a high yield. Structure-guided 
site-specific mutagenesis to change the cofactor preference has been 
reported several times e.g. in xylose reductases [98,99], phosphite 
dehydrogenase [100], alanine dehydrogenase [101], (BVMO) 
phenylacetone monooxygenase [102] and many more. As 
nicotinamide cofactors are expensive, they are frequently recycled in 
biotechnological processes, e.g. by the use of NAD(P)H oxidases. 
Bommarius and his group engineered the substrate binding pocket of 
an NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus plantarum  by site-specific 
mutagenesis to accept also NADPH [103].  Rational approaches for enzyme engineering

De novo  enzyme design 
 
Novel enzymes can be either designed by recreating known 
enzymatic functions in proteins with a different fold or by 
introduction of activities that have not been observed in natural 
enzymes before into a chosen protein scaffold. The biggest challenge, 
however, is the design of de novo  enzymes that are not based on 
natural sequences, thus designing the complete protein from scratch 
[104,105,106,107]. This is beyond the scope of this review and will 
not be addressed in detail. Most de novo  enzyme design approaches 
depend on computational methods, which have been developed and 
improved in the last two decades [108,109,6,106,110,111,112]. 
For the approaches described here, a detailed knowledge of the 
reaction mechanism and transition state is crucial to be able to predict 
which amino acids at which positions and distance are necessary to 
form an active site and catalyze the desired chemical reaction. In an 
approach by the Baker lab, in the first step idealized models of an 
enzymatic transition state are created by the use of quantum 
mechanical calculations (theozymes), which are in the next step fitted 
into protein scaffolds, which were identified from a library of folds 
and can accommodate the amino acids of the active site without 
clashes (RosettaMatch) [113,114]. However, usually no perfec t 
match is found and thus subtle deviations from the theozyme 
geometry have to be accepted (Figure 4). Another possibility offers 
SABER (Selection of Active/Binding sites for Enzyme Redesign), a 
computational method developed by the Houk lab, which searches for 
structures in which the necessary amino acids are already in place and 
only the substrate needs to be fitted in its transition state geometry 
[115]. Finally, in both approaches, the surrounding side chains are 
optimized for favorable interactions with the substrate/transition 
state model and stabilization of the protein fold (RosettaDesign) 
[113,114]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most prominent examples for designed novel enzymes with 
non-natural enzyme activities are a Kemp eliminase, a Diels-alderase 
and a retroaldolase. Although currently enzymes, which are designed 
de novo  by computational methods don’t reach the performance of 
natural enzymes or variants evolved in the laboratory, in some cases, 
they can be improved by standard protein engineering methods 
[5,116]. Mechanistic studies and structural analysis (also of inactive 
designs) will give indications about the quality of the design, identify problems, and help to improve the model and the computational 
parameters [117,118,119,120,121,122,123]. 
The computationally designed retroaldolase utilizes a catalytic 
lysine residue that forms a Schiff base with a keto group on the 
substrate, and then serves as an electron sink during C-C bond 
cleavage. To date 65 active designs were constructed in 14 different 
protein scaffolds [124,125], however with very low starting activities 
(kcat/K M values of less than 1 M-1s-1), which were further improved by 
systematically mutating amino acids at or near the active site (improve 
of k cat/K M values up to 88-fold) and directed evolution (in one 
protein the activity improved 700-fold over ten evolutionary cycles, a 
combination of a 100-fold increase in k cat/K M and an increased yield 
of soluble protein) [124,121]. However, the best improved and 
evolved retroaldolase design reaches a k cat/K M value of 55, which is 
still below catalytic antibodies with k cat/K M value of 490 under the 
same reaction conditions [124]. 
Other examples in which the initial design was further improved 
by random mutagenesis are the Kemp eliminase KE07 (improvement 
of k cat/K M values from 12 to 2,600 M-1s-1) [126] and the variant 
KE70, which was improved by a combination of rational and random 
mutagenesis to k cat/K M values up to 5x104 M-1s-1 [127]. The initial 
design combined a catalytic base, either Asp or Glu (KE07), or a His-
Asp/Glu dyad (KE70), a hydrogen bond donor (Ser or Lys) to 
stabilize the accumulating negative charge that develops on the 
phenolic oxygen, and an aromatic residue for substrate binding and 
delocalization of the negative charge of the transition state. Of the 59 
final designs, only eight showed activity [128]. Interestingly, the 
initially catalytically most active design KE59 was one of the most 
instable variants. After introduction of fold-stabilizing consensus 
mutations and 16 rounds of directed evolution the kcat /K M value 
increased > 2000-fold (from 163 to up to 0.6x106 M-1s-1) due to a 
large improvement of k cat [129]. Moreover, the optimized variant has 
a broader substrate acceptance. Structural analysis and MD 
simulations of improved variants of KE07, KE70 and KE59 led to 
explanations for the higher activity including a tighter substrate 
binding and the stabilization of the active-site dyad (KE70) in a 
conformation optimal for catalysis and a general more soluble and 
stable protein. In a different strategy of the Houk and Mayo labs - 
instead of characterizing many different designed proteins - the active 
site of a single template protein was redesigned to a Kemp eliminase 
using an approach described before [130]. After a detailed analysis of 
the structure and dynamics of an inactive first design and 
identification of possible causes for the inactivity, the focus of the 
design was moved from the native active site of the protein to a small 
pocket deeper in the protein [131]. This second design contained 
twelve mutations and resulted in a Kemp eliminase with a kcat /K M 
value of 123 M-1s-1, which was further improved 3-fold by single 
point mutations. Interestingly, two other groups managed to 
introduce Kemp eliminase activity into a hydrophobic pocket of 
calmodulin and a buried cavity in T4 lysozyme (differing from the 
native active site) by the introduction of just one charged amino acid, 
Glu and His respectively; however exhibing lower activity (k cat/K M 
values of 5.8 and 1.8 M-1s-1, respectively) than the above mentioned 
designs [132,133]. The k cat/K M values of catalytic antibodies for 
Kemp eliminations were reported to be 5,500 M-1s-1 using carboxylate 
as general base [134] and what is even more intriguing serum 
albumins e.g. BSA can catalyze the same reaction with k cat/K M values 
of 2,600 M-1s-1 by the action of a lysine side chain in a hydrophobic 
environment [135]. 
An even bigger challenge was the computational design of a Diels-
Alderase as it catalyzes the intermolecular C-C bond formation of two 
substrates [136]. Of the initially 1019 variants calculated by QM 
simulations, 106 could be fitted into protein scaffolds and after

further optimization finally 84 designs were chosen for biochemical 
characterization, of which 50 were expressed as soluble proteins but 
only two showed the desired activity. Although the turnover rate is 
very low (2 s-1), one variant is highly substrate- and stereospecific 
forming >97% of the stereoisomer (out of 8 possible) of the 
substrate it was designed for. An interesting approach was chosen for 
further improvement of this designed Diels-Alderase variant by 
challenging the players of the online computer game Foldit, which 
was created by the Baker Lab to help to predict protein structures 
[137], to remodel the active-site loops to enable additional interaction 
with the substrate [138].  
The most recent de novo  design is the introduction of a catalytic 
Cys-His dyad and oxyanion holes for ester hydrolysis into different 
protein folds [139]. The best design so far, which was further 
improved by site-specific mutagenesis reached a kcat /K M value of 405 
M-1s-1, which is still lower than catalytic antibodies. Again structural 
analysis revealed bottlenecks, which will help to improve subsequent 
designs.  
 
Artificial metalloenzymes 
 
Artificial metalloenzymes are thought as a bridge between 
biocatalysis and transition-metal complexes by incorporating the 
catalytically active transition metal complex in the protein scaffold 
enabling a high activity and selectivity [105,140]. There are several 
approaches how this can be achieved, which can be divided in two 
main categories: non-covalent anchoring, where either the affinity of a 
protein for a transition metal is used (dative anchoring) or high-
affinity protein substrate interactions are employed (supramolecular 
anchoring), and covalent modification (for a review see [141]). The 
range of metal ions that can be incorporated in the active site increases 
the range of chemical transformations catalyzed by the enzyme. Some 
enzymes already display promiscuous activity due to different metal 
ions present in the active site (e.g. [142,143]). In some cases the 
intrinsic metal ions of natural metalloproteins were successfully 
exchanged to different metal ions, thereby altering the reaction 
catalyzed by the enzyme. Carbonic anhydrase II is a zinc 
metalloenzyme with Zn2+ interacting with three His residues. Its 
physiological role is the catalysis of the reversible hydration of carbon 
dioxide with a k cat/K M value close to the diffusion limit. However, 
carbonic anhydrase II shows also promiscuous esterase activity [144]. 
The replacement of the Zn2+ in human carbonic anhydrase by Mn2+ 
resulted in a peroxidase, which catalyzes the efficient oxidation of o-
dianisidine (k cat/K M = 1.4x106) in the presence of bicarbonate and 
hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), and also epoxidation of olefins, however 
with only low to moderate enantioselectivity [145,146]. The same 
group also showed that rhodium-substituted carbonic anhydrase 
induced stereoselective hydrogenation of stilbene favoring cis- over 
trans-stilbene by about 20:1 [147]. It also catalyzes the 
hydroformylation of olefins with a regioselectivity of 8.4 for linear 
over branched aldehyde product, which is in opposite to uncomplexed 
Rh, which results in mainly branched product [148]. Exchange of the 
metal ion in the Zn2+-dependent -lactamase from Stenotrophomonas 
maltophilia  to Cu2+ resulted in 10-fold lower lactamase activity and a 
promiscuous new oxidase activity towards catechol. This oxidase 
activity was further improved by site-specific mutagenesis to stabilize 
the coordination of the Cu2+ ion in the second metal binding site 
[149]. 
Another option is the creation of a novel metal binding site in a 
host protein by introduction of coordinating amino acids at 
geometrically appropriate positions of the protein. Reetz and his 
group introduced two His residues in the thermostable protein tHisF, the synthase subunit of an imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase, 
from Thermotoga maritima  to create a 2-His -1-carboxylate motif for 
the binding of Cu2+ [150]. They showed that the enantioselectivity of 
a model Diels-Alder cycloaddition was enhanced with the protein-
Cu2+ catalyst compared to Cu2+ alone. A similar approach was 
followed by Lu and coworkers, who introduced three histidines and 
one glutamate or two histidines and one glutamate to create a new 
non-heme iron center in myoglobin near the unchanged heme cofactor 
to design a nitric oxide reductase (NOR) [151,152,153], which 
should help to understand the reaction mechanism of naturally 
occurring NORs. Both enzymes converted NO to N 2O. Myoglobin 
was found to display weak nitrite reductase (NiR) activity. The X-ray 
structure of NiR identified the location of two His and one Tyr 
residues, which are essential for NiR activity. As for NOR, suitable 
target residues for mutagenesis were identified in myoglobin by 
molecular modeling in combination with molecular dynamics 
simulations giving an insight into the nitrite binding by calculation of 
theoretical K M-values [154]. However, so far experimental data are 
missing. 
In yet a different strategy mononuclear zinc metalloenzymes were 
computationally redesigned to catalyze the hydrolysis of 
organophosphates by changing active site amino acids while 
maintaining the coordination geometry around the metal ion [155]. 
Of twelve designs a redesigned adenosine deaminase hydrolyzed the 
achiral organophosphate diethyl 7-hydroxycoumarinyl phosphate 
(DECP) and was further improved by directed evolution (k cat/K M 
values up to 104 M-1s-1). It also hydrolyzed the coumarinyl analog of 
the nerve agent cyclosarin with a preference for the R P isomer. 
 
Conclusion 
 
This review describes recent advances in enzyme engineering 
focusing on rational approaches for the creation of biocatalysts with 
improved activity, enantioselectivity, substrate range, stability and also 
new catalytic functions. It is highlighted that in many cases protein 
structures helped to understand the basis of the enzyme’s reaction 
mechanism and allowed the successful fine-tuning of the active site by 
rational design by only a few specific mutations thereby providing a 
strong alternative to extensive screening of large libraries with directed 
evolution approaches.  
However, despite the availability of a fast-growing number of 
protein structures and highly sophisticated computational algorithms 
pure rational design is still limited by (i) our incomplete 
understanding of the enzyme functions and protein folding, (ii) the 
flexibility of the proteins and conformational changes upon e.g. 
substrate binding, and thus (iii) our still limited understanding of 
protein dynamics [122], (iv) the sensitivity of the enzymatic reaction 
to small changes in distances and geometry of the substrate in relation 
to the active site amino acids and to the influence of active site water 
molecules [139,123], (v) the adverse effect of some mutations on the 
expression and stability of the protein (e.g. [156,157]), (vi) the 
positive effect of apparently unrelated distant mutations as well as 
correlated mutations, which are at the moment difficult to predict 
[158,40,17,24] and (vii) the enormous computational capacity 
needed for processing large data volumes.  
Thus, pure computational design of de novo  enzymes is still in its 
infancies and the tailored biocatalysts show just small, but promising 
activities. However, the probability of the success of solely random 
strategies is also low and requires high screening effort. This review 
provides several examples, in which the combination of rational design 
with subsequent directed evolution led to the most promising de novo  
enzymes.  Rational approaches for enzyme engineering

In summary, there exists no general strategy how to proceed in the 
engineering of a certain enzyme. It strongly depends on the reaction 
and enzyme of interest, the biochemical and structural data available, 
the structural bioinformatics expertise and computational equipment, 
and the library screening capabilities to mention just a few. Currently, 
computational enzyme design has fundamentally changed the way 
biocatalysts can be altered, but it cannot yet replace directed evolution 
as a method of choice for protein engineering. On the contrary, the 
two approaches are complementary and should be combined for 
reaching the most promising results either in semi-rational approaches 
or using them subsequently.
