Abstract
Water-soluble quaternized celluloses with various substitution degrees were prepared. The polymers showed excellent ﬂocculation ability
against anionic dyes; this ability was strongly dependent on the substituent degree and not affected by the temperature and pH of the dye solution.The ﬂocculation ability was accurately ﬁtted by a pseudo-second order kinetic model, which enabled reliable predictions of the ﬂocculationbehavior. In addition, the ﬂocculation behavior of the anionic dyes followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, whose analysis revealed themaximum anionic dye coagulation/ﬂocculation capacity. The quaternized celluloses could be regenerated by washing in NaOH solution andprecipitation in acetone. The quaternized celluloses exhibited good biodegradability, with a maximum degradation of 48% within 48 h usingcellulase. These encouraging results indicate that the cationic celluloses could be applicable for use as reusable ﬂocculants for wastewatertreatment, leading to an environmentally friendly method to the removal of dyes from aqueous solutions.© 2017 Tomsk Polytechnic University.

1. Introduction
Dyes are widely used in many industrial applications,
including textile, rubber, paper, plastic, and cosmetic ones,among others. More than 10,000 types of dyes are commer-cially available, and more than 7 ×10
5tons per year are pro-
duced worldwide [1]. Most of these dyes are not only
aesthetically displeasing, but also impede light penetration,retard photosynthetic activity, and inhibit the growth of biota. Inaddition, many dyes are toxic and carcinogenic
[1,2] . About 2%
of the industrially produced dyes are discharged directly inaqueous efﬂuents
[3], therefore making the elimination of dyes
from wastewater before discharge into the environment a fun-damental priority.
Among various methods for dye removal such as adsorption
[4], coagulation [5], membrane ﬁltration [6], oxidation [7], and
biological processes [8], the coagulation/ﬂocculation processes
are employed for treating dye-bearing industrial efﬂuents [9]dueto its low operating cost and ease to perform. Typical reactants
used in these processes are polyelectrolytes derived frominorganic salts of Al or Fe. Although chemical coagulation usingthese compounds is suitable for dye removal, the process hassome drawbacks: the effectiveness of the removal stronglydepends on the pH and ionic strength of the efﬂuent, and thetreated water may eventually contain high residual Al or Feion concentrations
[10]. In order to minimize these issues,
polysaccharide-based polyelectrolytes are being investigated asmore practical alternatives to synthetic polyelectrolytes, due totheir biocompatibility and biodegradability
[11].
Cellulose, which is the most abundant polysaccharide on
Earth, is a prime candidate as precursor of bio-based functionalmaterials. The high degree of polymerization and number ofpotential chemical modiﬁcations of cellulose also make it anattractive candidate for ﬂocculation purposes. For example,sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), which is a well knownwater-soluble and anionic cellulose derivative, has shownpromising results as an anionic ﬂocculation agent, despite thepoor solubility in acidic solutions that limits its practical appli-cation as ﬂocculation reagent in these conditions
[12]. In addi-
tion, the use of anionic ﬂocculation agents is still infrequent ascompared with the use of cationic ﬂocculants. With such a* Division of Applied Chemistry and Biochemistry, National College of

background, the cationic cellulose derivatives have been paid
attention as ﬂocculation agents [13–16] .
Water-soluble quaternized cellulose derivatives (QCs) have
great potential for various industrial applications because thetertiary ammonium groups in the polymer exhibit intermediatebasicity and are permanently charged, independently of the pHof their solutions
[13]. Due to their excellent cationic character,
QCs could be used as additive in papermaking, as thickener formineral processing, and as conditioner in hair care products
[12]. Recently, QC has been found to exhibit high ﬂocculation
ability toward colloidal particles whose surfaces are negativelycharged, such as kaolin
[13], calcium carbonates [17], and
colloidal silica particles [18]. The ﬂocculation performance for
these small particles suspended in solutions by QC is related totwo major mechanisms. The ﬁrst mechanism is the charge neu-tralization of the particles by QC. The second major mechanismconcerns the intermolecular bridging between the suspendedparticles by the QC chains
[18]. On the other hand, the ﬂoccu-
lation ability and its mechanism of QC toward small com-pounds such as dye molecules have not been investigated indetail.
In this study, water-soluble QCs having different degrees of
substitution (DS) were homogeneously prepared from cellulosedissolved in urea/NaOH solution by the reaction with 2,3-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (EPTMAC) as aetheriﬁcation reagent, and their coagulation and ﬂocculationperformances toward anionic dyes were investigated (
Fig. 1 ). In
addition, the effects of DS, pH, and temperature on the coagu-lation and ﬂocculation ability, as well as the kinetics
and isotherms of the coagulation/ﬂocculation processes wereinvestigated in detail in order to elucidate the correspondingmechanism. Moreover, the possibility of biodegradability andreusing of the QCs was investigated in order to reveal the QCsas an excellent biodegradable and reusable ﬂocculants.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Powdered cellulose (an average polymerization degree of
320) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals Industries(Japan). EPTMAC was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.(USA). AcidRed 13 (AR13), AcidBlue 92 (AB92), and AR 112dyes were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd.(Japan). Trichoderma viride (T. viride ) cellulase ONOZUKA
R-10 was purchased from Y akult Pharmaceutical Industry Co.,Japan. Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, DS =0.87) was
purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals Co., Japan. Other chemi-cals employed in this work were of a chemically pure grade, andall solutions were prepared with pure water.
2.2. Preparation of QCs
A series of three QCs (labeled 1–3) were prepared
from cellulose with EPTMAC according to the methodpreviously reported. Brieﬂy, cellulose (1.26 g, 7.78 mmol peranhydroglucose unit (AGU)) was suspended in 50 mL of1.5 mol L
−1NaOH solution containing 1 g of urea, and the
Fig. 1. Scheme of the preparation of quaternized cellulose (QC) from cellulose (a) and structures of the anionic dyes used in study (b).56 H. Kono / Resource-Efﬁcient Technologies 3 (2017) 55–63
suspension was cooled to 259 K. After 1 h, the temperature of the
suspension was set to 271 K and the suspension was vigorouslystirred at 800 rpm for 10 min to completely dissolve the cellulose
[19]. The temperature of the cellulose solution was set to 298 K,
EPTMAC (8.89 g, 58.6 mmol) was then added the solution, andthen the reaction mixture was heated at 333 K for 3 h. Aftercooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into 300 mLof methanol. The obtained precipitates were washed with a 1:1mixture of methanol/distilled water to reach neutral pH, and driedunder vacuum to obtain the ﬂocculant hereafter labeled QC 1. The
QC2ﬂocculant was prepared by a similar method, by changing the
feed amount of EPTMAC to 11.8 g (77.8 mmol), whereas QC 3
was prepared by repeating the method used to prepare QC 2twice.
The QCs were stored in a desiccator under vacuum until ready foruse.
2.3. Structural characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on
a PerkinElmer Spectrum II FTIR spectrometer at a resolution of1c m
−1. The spectra were measured from 4000 to 650 cm−1
using an average of 16 scans. NMR spectra of QCs were mea-sured at 363 K in deuterium oxide containing 0.1% 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid as an internal standardusing Bruker A VIII 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpinGmbH, Germany) equipped with a two-channel 5 mm broad-band observe probe. The quantitative
13C NMR spectra were
obtained by the inverse-gated1H decoupling method [19–21]
with a ﬂip angle for13C excitation pulse of 30° and repetition
time of 45 s. The13C NMR chemical shifts were calibrated by
referencing to 0 ppm the methyl resonance of the internalstandard.
2.4. Biodegradability test
Before performing the biodegradability test for QC 1–3,
cellulase activity was measured using CMC as a substrate by thefollowing method
[22]. A total of 10 mL of the reaction mixture
containing 9 mL of 1 (w/v) % CMC in 50 mmol L−1acetate
buffer (pH 5.0), and 10 mg of cellulase dissolved in 1 mL of thesame buffer solution was incubated at 313 K. After 30 min, theamount of reducing sugars in the mixture was measured bythe method of Miller et al.
[23]. One unit (U) of the cellulase
activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme liberating 1 mmolof reducing sugar per min. The protein mass of the cellulase wasdetermined by use of the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Co.,USA) with bovine serum albumin as the standard
[24].
The biodegradability test was carried out using the cellulase
according to the method previously reported [22]. Brieﬂy, each
QC (100 mg) was dissolved in the 19 mL of 50 mM acetatebuffer (pH 5.0), and cellulase dissolved in 1 mL of the samebuffer solution was added to the suspension to give a cellulaseconcentration of 0.20 U/mL. The mixture was incubated at313 K. After a prescribed period, an aliquot (500 μL) was with-
drawn from the mixture, and the amount of reducing sugars inthe aliquot was determined by the method described above. Thebiodegradability of the QCs was determined using the follow-ing equation:Biodegradability bdb %,( )=×( ) MMM 100 (1)
where Mbis the molar mass of AGU in the QC sample before
the cellulase digestion, and Mdis the molar mass of the reducing
sugars liberated by the cellulase.
2.5. Flocculation of dyes
The ﬂocculation ability of a QC was estimated by the fol-
lowing procedure: a buffer solution (5 mL) containing a dyewith an initial concentration ( C
0) in the range of 0.050–1 g L−1
was poured into a 15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube, and a
precisely weighed amount of QC was added to the dye solution;the mixture was immediately placed in a shaker at 120 rpm and298 K for 120 min, after which the suspension was left to settlefor 5 min. The dye concentration of the ﬁltrate was determinedby an Epoch 96-well micro-volume spectrophotometer with aTake3 micro-volume quartz plate (BioTek Instruments, Inc.,USA), using a previously prepared calibration curve at 504 nmfor AR13, 572 nm for AB92, and 530 nm for AR112. Theﬂocculation ability of a QC at a contact time t(Q
t) was calcu-
lated according to Eq. (2):
QCC V
mtt=( ) −0, (2)
where Ctis the concentration of the dye at contact time t,Vis
the volume of the dye solution, and mis the mass of the QC.
The buffer solutions used for the adsorption media were20 mmol L
−1citric acid-sodium citrate (pH 3–6), 20 mmol L−1
NaH 2PO 4–Na 2HPO 4(pH 7–8), 20 mmol L−1Tris–HCl (pH 9),
and 20 mmol L−1NaHCO 3–NaOH (pH 10–11).
2.6. Recycling experiments
After the ﬂocculation experiments, the formed ﬂoc was
recovered by centrifugation at 8000 gfor 10 min. The ﬂoc was
immersed in 1.5 mol L−1aqueous NaOH solution (20 mL) for
1 h to remove the dye [19], and then 40 mL of acetone was
added to the solution to precipitate the QC. After centrifugationat 8000 gfor 10 min, the precipitate was washed with methanol
(20 mL) for three times to obtained the regenerated QC. Afterdrying, the ﬂocculation ability of the regenerated QC after n
cycles was determined by the protocols described above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization of the ﬂocculants
QC1–3were prepared from cellulose dissolved in the urea/
NaOH solution, and the obtained QCs were characterized byFTIR and
13C NMR spectroscopic analyses ( Fig. 2 ). The FTIR
spectra of QC 1–3exhibit absorption bands corresponding to
the asymmetric —CH 3stretching vibration at 1481 cm−1and
the C—N stretching vibration at 916 cm−1, due to the quater-
nary ammonium groups substituted at hydroxyl groups of cel-lulose. In addition, the adsorption bands of cellulose areobserved at 1412, 1382, 1318, and 897 cm
−1, which can be
assigned to the —CH 2scissoring, —OH bending, O—H
deformation, and β-glucopyranose ring-breathing vibrations,57 H. Kono / Resource-Efﬁcient Technologies 3 (2017) 55–63
respectively [25]. The precise DS of the cationic groups substi-
tuted in the QC 1–3compounds was estimated from their quan-
titative13C NMR spectra through the following Eq. (3):
DS =I
ICH
C3
13, (3)
where ICH3and IC1are the integrals of the CH 3and anomeric C1
resonances at 57 and 105 ppm, respectively. The estimated DScan then be used to calculate the yield of each QC through Eq.

The resulting DS values for QC 1–3were 0.56, 0.84, and
1.33, respectively, and the yields were in range of 65–82%(
Table 1 ).
3.2. Biodegradability
Enzymatic degradation of the QCs was performed at 313 K
using cellulase. Fig. 3 shows the time dependence of degrada-
tion. The cellulase degrades the β-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds of
cellulose, while ether bonds in the substituent groups of thecellulose ethers are not degraded by the cellulase
[25]. There-
fore, the biodegradability in the ﬁgure means the percentage ofdegraded β-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds in the QCs by cellulase.
After 48 h of incubation with cellulase, the degradability of theQC1–3was found to be 48, 32, and 21%, respectively, under the
conditions employed. The degradation speed as well adecreased with increase of DS of the QCs. This indicated thatthe QCs with high DS forbid cellulase to easily contact with thepolymer chains, similar to those of other cellulose derivatives
[22,26–28] .
3.3. Flocculation of anionic dyes
3.3.1. Inﬂuence of external parameters
Flocculation efﬁciency of the ionic ﬂocculants is generally
affected by external parameters such as temperature, pH, andﬂocculant dosage
[3]. In this study, the inﬂuence of these
parameters on the ﬂocculation ability of QC 1–3was ﬁrst inves-
tigated using the AB92 dye.
The effect of the temperature was investigated in the tem-
perature range of 293–323 K ( Fig. 4 a). The ﬂocculation ability
(Q) strongly depends on the DS of the QCs and stays approxi-
mately constant in the temperature range investigated: the Q
values of QC 1–3are 0.321 ±0.010, 0.400 ±0.013, and
0.599 ±0.015 g g−1, respectively, suggesting that the ﬂoccula-tion is determined by charge neutralization between the anionic
dye molecules and cationic groups in the QC chains, and thatthe temperature has no inﬂuence on the ﬂocculation of AB92.Therefore, the ﬂocculation mechanism could be described as ahomogeneous adsorption process induced by the electrostaticinteraction between the anionic dye and the QC chains becausephysical adsorption processes generally exhibit a strong tem-perature dependence
[29].
Fig. 4 b shows the ﬂocculation ability of QC 1–3in the pH
range of 3–11. The ﬂocculation performance maintained a con-Table 1

stant level in the whole pH range, due to the quaternary ammo-
nium groups of the QC chains. As for the previous test ( Fig. 4 a),
also in this case the ﬂocculation of AB92 showed a strongdependence on the DS of the QCs, supporting the ﬁnding thatthe ﬂocculation process occurred via a charge neutralizationmechanism.
As shown in
Fig. 4 c, variable ﬂocculant doses (0–1 g L−1)
were exposed to a ﬁxed initial dye concentration to evaluate theinﬂuence of the dosage on the ﬂocculation ability of the QCs.The results showed that the ﬂocculation ability increased withincreasing ﬂocculant doses up to an optimal value, followed bya decreasing trend with further dose increases. The optimaldoses for QC 1–3were 0.40, 0.30, and 0.20 g L
−1, respectively.
These trends are typical of ﬂocculant systems controlled by acharge neutralization mechanism
[25,26] . In particular, when
the amount of cationic charge supplied was sufﬁcient for thecomplete neutralization of the anionic charge, the ﬂocculationof the dye reached the maximum efﬁciency. Excess of cationiccharge following overdosing of the ﬂocculant induces a disper-sion restabilization phenomenon and a subsequent decrease inthe efﬁciency of the ﬂocculation process
[20,25] . This could be
conﬁrmed by the order of Qtvalues (QC 1>QC2>QC3)a t
very high ﬂocculant concentrations such as 1.0 g L−1: the excess
of cationic charge by the QC ﬂocculants caused electrostaticrepulsion between the QC chains in the formed ﬂocs, whichresulted in the dispersion of the polymer chains.
3.3.2. Flocculation kinetics
The contact time between dyes and QC chains is another
important parameter for understanding the ﬂocculation kinetics
[30]. The effect of the contact time on the ﬂocculation ability of
QC3toward AR13, AB92, and AR112 was investigated at pH 7,
and the results are shown in Fig. 5 a. The ﬂocculation ability
rapidly increased following contact between each dye and theQC, before eventually reaching a plateau at a contact time of30 min for all dyes. The equilibrium value of the ﬂocculationability followed the order AR13 >AB92 >AR112, which indi-
cated the charge neutralization mechanism between the anionicsulfonate groups of the dye and the cationic groups of QC
chains: AR13, AB92, and AR112 contain 2, 3, and 4 sulfonategroups per molecule, respectively. The amounts of AR13,AB92, and AR112 dyes ﬂocculated by the QC 3in
Fig. 5 a were
standardized by amounts of sulfonate groups of each dye, andthe results were shown in
Fig. 5 b. If the anionic sulfonate
groups of dyes were completely neutralized by the oppositecharges of QC 3, these three curves displayed in
Fig. 5 bo v e r -
lapped. However, these anionic dyes were different from eachother in their ﬂocculation curves, and the equilibrium valueof the standardized ﬂocculation ability followed the order
Fig. 3. Cellulase degradation of QC 1–3ﬂocculants.
Fig. 4. Inﬂuence of temperature (a), pH (b), and ﬂocculant dosage (c) on the
coagulation/ﬂocculation of AB92 dye by QC 1–3ﬂocculants. These experi-
ments were performed under the following conditions: ﬂocculant dose0.20 g L
−1; contact time 120 min; saturation concentration of the adsorbate ( C0)
1 . 0gL−1; pH 7; temperature 298 K.59 H. Kono / Resource-Efﬁcient Technologies 3 (2017) 55–63
AR13 >AB92 >AR112. This indicates that the ﬂocculation of
anionic dyes with QCs depends on the molecular structure ofthe anionic dyes and that anionic dyes with low number(s) ofanionic groups are preferable to achieve efﬁcient ﬂocculation.
Several kinetic models have been previously used to
describe the kinetics of dye ﬂocculation, and pseudo-ﬁrst order
[31] as well as pseudo-second order [32] kinetic models have
frequently been used to ﬁt the experimental data. The pseudo-ﬁrst order and pseudo-second order kinetic models aredescribed by the following equations

respectively, where k1andk2are the rate constants for the pseudo-
ﬁrst and pseudo-second order models, while Qeand Qtare
the ﬂocculation abilities at equilibrium and contact time t,respectively. Curve-ﬁtting plots of the ﬂocculation ability of
AR13, AB92, and AR112 by QC 1–3using the two kinetic models
are shown in Fig. A1, and the ﬁtted k1,k2, and Qe,calparameters are
summarized in Table 2 , together with the corresponding
correlation coefﬁcients ( R2) . For all ﬁtting curves, the R2values
for the pseudo-second order kinetic model ( R2=0.996–1.000)
were higher than those of the pseudo-ﬁrst order model(R
2=0.865–0.991). In addition, the Qe,calvalues determined by the
pseudo-second order model were more consistent with theexperimentally-determined ﬂocculation ability at equilibriumQ
e,exp, compared with the Qe,calparameters obtained with the
pseudo-ﬁrst order kinetic model. These results prove that theﬂocculation of these dyes with QCs completely followed apseudo-second order adsorption mechanism, and thus that theﬂocculation behavior by QCs could be predicted over the entirerange of contact times using the rate constant k
2in the same way as
the electrostatic adsorption of ionic dyes onto the otherpolysaccharide-based ﬂocculants
[20,25] .

3.3.3. Flocculation isotherms
Adsorption isotherms represent a key tool for characterizing
the interaction between adsorbates and adsorbents. TheLangmuir, Freundlich, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)isotherms are applied to describe the ﬂocculation behaviors bypolymer ﬂocculants
[33,34] , and were applied here to analyze
the ﬂocculation of the anionic dyes by the QC 1–3ﬂocculants.
The Langmuir isotherm assumes monolayer adsorption onto
a surface containing a ﬁnite number of adsorption sites ofuniform adsorption energies, with no transmigration of adsor-bates in the surface plane. Once an adsorption site is ﬁlled byadsorbate, no further adsorption can take place at that site
[33]:
this results in the surface reaching a saturation point corre-sponding to the maximum adsorption capacity. Thus, the linearform of the isotherm is represented by:
11 1
00 Q Q bQ Cee=+ , (7)
where Qeis the amount of adsorbate on the adsorbant at
equilibrium (g g−1),Q0is the maximum monolayer coverage
capacity (mg g−1),bis the Langmuir constant (L mg−1), and Ce
is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate (mg L−1). As
shown in Fig. A2a, the reciprocal ﬂocculation ability at equilibriumQ
eplotted against the equilibrium dye concentration Cefor the
ﬂocculation of anionic dyes by QCs strictly obeys the Langmuirisotherm equation, as shown by R
2coefﬁcients of 0.998–0.999
(Table 3 ). In addition, the Q0values for the ﬂocculation of
anionic dyes determined by the Langmuir isotherm model arein good agreement with the equilibrium adsorption abilities ofthe QCs. By using the Langmuir constant b, the dimensionless
separation factor ( R
L) could be obtained as:
RbCL=+( )1
1 0. (8)
The RLvalue allows classifying the adsorption process as
unfavorable ( RL>1), linear ( RL=1), favorable (0 <RL<1), or
irreversible ( RL=0)[35]. As summarized in Table 3 , the con-
stants RLare in the 0.02–0.11 range, indicating favorable
adsorption of all dyes onto QCs.
The Freundlich isotherm is an empirical model, whose linear
form is given in Eq. (8):ln ln ln ,QKnC eF e=+1(9)
where KFis the Freundlich constant, corresponding to the
maximum adsorption capacity, and the dimensionless constantn
−1is an empirical parameter related to the isotherm shape.
Based on the n−1values, the adsorption process can be classiﬁed
as irreversible ( n−1=0), favorable (0 <n−1<1), or unfavorable
(n−1>1)[34], The ln Qeversus ln Ceplots for each dye
ﬂocculation shown in Fig. A2b yield the constants KFand n−1
summarized in Table 3 . The estimated n−1values lie in the range
of 0.232–0.590, conﬁrming favorable adsorption of the dyesonto QC chains. However, the R
2coefﬁcients for the Freundlich
model are in range of 0.899–0.975, considerably lower thanthose corresponding to the Langmuir model.
The BET isotherm was developed to describe multilayer
adsorption systems, and its linear form is given in Eq.

where Qmis the amount of adsorbate adsorbed in a complete

of the adsorbate [34].The Qm,Kb, and R2values for the ﬂocculation
of anionic dyes by QC 1–3determined from the BET plots (Fig.
A2c) are summarized in Table 3 . The R2for the BET model
(R2=0.512–0.854) are considerably lower than those calculated
for both Freundlich ( R2=0.899–0.975) and Langmuir
(R2=0.998–0.999) isotherm models. In addition, the Qmvalues
determined by the BET plots are inconsistent with the observedﬂocculation ability at equilibrium Q
e. These results indicate that
multilayer adsorption of dyes onto QC chains, with the associatedinteractions between anionic dyes, did not occur in theﬂocculation process of the dyes.
The curve-ﬁtting analysis using the three isotherm models
thus shows that the adsorption of the anionic dyes onto theQC chains follow a Langmuir-type adsorption model. TheLangmuir adsorption model is derived from the followingassumptions: 1) the adsorbed molecules do not interact witheach other, and 2) all molecules are adsorbed by the samemechanism. Therefore, the good ﬁt to the Langmuir isothermmodel suggests that the ﬂocculation of the dyes follows aTable 3

homogeneous mechanism based on charge neutralization
between dye molecules and the quaternary ammonium groupsof QCs, which is supported by the observation that the ﬂoccu-lation process does not involve physical adsorption. If otherinteractions besides the electrostatic ones played an importantrole in the ﬂocculation process, the ﬂocculation behavior wouldbe ﬁtted by the Freundlich or BET adsorption isotherm models,which are generally employed to ﬁt the heterogeneous andmultilayer adsorption systems, respectively
[36].
3.4. Regeneration and reuse of ﬂocculants
In order to reduce the operating costs of QCs as ﬂocculants,
easy regeneration of the adsorbent after dye ﬂocculation ishighly desirable. Recycling experiments were thus carried outusing QC 3and the AB92 dye. After ﬂocculation with AB92,
QC3was recycled as described in experimental section and
then used again to carry out the ﬂocculation.
Fig. 6 shows no
signiﬁcant losses in the dye ﬂocculation performance even afterﬁve cycles despite a weight loss of more than 5% after immer-sion in NaOH solution and precipitation with methanol. TheQC3ability to retain its ﬂocculation capacity after several uses
highlighted by these results should support a reduction of theoperating costs associated to the use of these ﬂocculants forwater puriﬁcation.
4. Conclusions
The present work shows that quaternized celluloses can be
used as efﬁcient and recyclable ﬂocculants with high adsorptioncapacity for anionic dye decontamination. As the ﬂocculationprocess reaches equilibrium within 30 min, the fast kinetics ofthe process can permit fast decontamination of pollutants. Theﬂocculation performance is hardly altered by changes in tem-perature and pH; therefore, the present QCs would surviveunder a range of different operating conditions. In addition, theefﬁcient regeneration capabilities of the QCs highlighted in thiswork could signiﬁcantly reduce the operating costs of waste-
water treatments.
