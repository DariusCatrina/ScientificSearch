established for oxidation of the C-1 atom of glucose [14, Figure 5B shows the PQQ moiety of GDH, along with
the glucose and the histidine and arginine side chains 33, 34] and has been postulated for MDH [30, 35, 36].
In GDH, the O-1 of bound glucose is hydrogen bonded hydrogen bonded to it, superimposed upon the active
site of ADH IIB. To do this superposition, it was first to an active site histidine, which could act as a base to
abstract the hydroxyl proton. Glucose binding is also necessary to reflect the coordinates of these groups
through the plane of the PQQ, since PQQ binding to the stabilized by hydrogen bonding of O-1 to the side chains
