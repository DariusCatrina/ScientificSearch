SUMMARY Biomass constitutes an appealing alternative to fossil resources for the
production of materials and energy. The abundance and attractiveness of vegetal
biomass come along with challenges pertaining to the intricacy of its structure,evolved during billions of years to face and resist abiotic and biotic attacks. Toachieve the daunting goal of plant cell wall decomposition, microorganisms havedeveloped many (enzymatic) strategies, from which we seek inspiration to developbiotechnological processes. A major breakthrough in the ﬁeld has been the discov-ery of enzymes today known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs),which, by catalyzing the oxidative cleavage of recalcitrant polysaccharides, allow ca-nonical hydrolytic enzymes to depolymerize the biomass more efﬁciently. Very re-cently, it has been shown that LPMOs are not classical monooxygenases in that theycan also use hydrogen peroxide (H
2O2) as an oxidant. This discovery calls for a revi-
sion of our understanding of how lignocellulolytic enzymes are connected sinceH
2O2is produced and used by several of them. The ﬁrst part of this review is dedi-
cated to the LPMO paradigm, describing knowns, unknowns, and uncertainties. Wethen present different lignocellulolytic redox systems, enzymatic or not, that dependon ﬂuxes of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Based on an assessment of these puta-tively interconnected systems, we suggest that ﬁne-tuning of H
2O2levels and prox-
imity between sites of H2O2production and consumption are important for fungal
biomass conversion. In the last part of this review, we discuss how our evolving un-derstanding of redox processes involved in biomass depolymerization may translateinto industrial applications.

INTRODUCTION
One of the main pillars of the Earth’s carbon cycle is the depolymerization of
complex plant biomass (1), and a complete understanding of this process is of
utmost
interest for fundamental biology and crucial for the emerging bioeconomy ( 2,
3). The structural intricacy of this raw material, primarily composed of cellulose, various
hemicelluloses,
and lignin, is mirrored by the complexity of the network of enzymatic
and chemical reactions developed by microorganisms to decompose it. This network isfarfromfullyunderstood.Untilrecently,degradationoftherecalcitrantpolysaccharidesin plant biomass was thought to be mainly achieved by an arsenal of hydrolytic
enzymes called glycoside hydrolases (GHs) ( 4). In some ecosystems, the enzymatic
decomposition
process is thought to be supported by Fenton chemistry, i.e., transition
metal-driven in situgenerationofH2O2-derivedhydroxylradicals,whichareamongthe
most powerful oxidizing species found on Earth (5) and are able to unspeciﬁcally
oxidize
both polysaccharides and lignin in plant biomass ( 6).
Several
decades ago, Elwyn Reese and colleagues proposed that nonhydrolytic
proteins were involved in cellulose decomposition. This proposal is known as the C1-Cx
postulate in which the C1factor (nonhydrolytic proteins) acts as an enhancing protein
for the Cxfactor (hydrolytic enzymes) ( 7). In 1974, Eriksson and colleagues noticed that
cellulose
degradation by culture ﬁltrates of white-rot fungi was more efﬁcient in the
presence of O2, leading to the hypothesis that oxidative processes contribute to
cellulose conversion (8). In 2005, studying enzymatic chitin degradation, Vaaje-Kolstad
et
al. showed that a 21-kDa protein named chitin-binding protein, or CBP21, by Suzuki
et al. (9), drastically enhanced the efﬁciency of classical (hydrolytic) chitinases ( 10). Five
years
later, in 2010, i.e., 60 years after Reese’s postulate, it was shown that CBP21
represents a new class of enzymes that carry out oxidative cleavage of polysaccharides(11). These enzymes, today known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs)
(12), are mono-copper redox enzymes ( 13,14) that hydroxylate the C-1 or C-4 carbons
of 
scissileglycosidicbonds( 11,15–18)inanO2-andreductant-dependentmanner( 11).

hydrolases belonging to family GH61 (19, 20) or noncatalytic bacterial carbohydrate
binding
modules (CBMs) belonging to family CBM33, the 2010 discovery led to gath-
ering these proteins of diverse origins under the common acronym LPMO ( 12) or,
alternatively,
polysaccharide monooxygenase (PMO) ( 14). Today, LPMOs are classiﬁed
as
auxiliary activities (AA) (21) in the database of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy)
(22,23), where they form families AA9, -10, -11, -13, -14, and -15. LPMOs are today seen
as
keyfrontlineweaponsinthewarfarebetweenattackers(e.g.,fungiandbacteria)and
defenders (e.g., plants) ( 24).
LPMOs
are unique in the sense that they are able to attack polysaccharides that are
organized in recalcitrant structures (e.g., crystalline cellulose or chitin; hemicellulose-
cellulose complexes) ( 25). While canonical glycoside hydrolases (GHs) interact with
single
polysaccharide chains, meaning that a decrystallization penalty needs to be paid
(26), LPMOs act on surfaces; that is, they cleave a polysaccharide chain while this chain
is
in a crystalline context (11). By doing so, LPMOs render a relatively inaccessible
substrate
tractable to further depolymerization by GHs ( 27–30). In this connection,
real-time
atomic force microscopy studies have shown that LPMOs are relatively
immobile on the cellulose surface and that cellulase-catalyzed substrate turnover ishigherafterLPMOtreatment( 31).Inaveryinterestingstudyusing in
 situimaging,ithas
also been shown that the progression of hydrolases and the boosting effect of LPMOsare dependent on the type of plant tissue ( 30).
A 
recent milestone in the ﬁeld concerns the discovery that H2O2can drive LPMO
reactions in the absence of O2(32,33). In fact, it has been claimed that H2O2is the
preferred, and perhaps even the only, cosubstrate of LPMOs ( 32,34), which contrasts
with
established paradigms and raises questions as to whether LPMOs should be
classiﬁed as monooxygenases. Importantly, H2O2is also a reaction product or substrate
in several other enzyme-catalyzed lignocellulolytic reactions, in particular, in ligninconversion ( 35). Thus, H
2O2may play a central role in the reaction networks of biomass
conversion. Interestingly, H2O2and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in general are
increasingly considered metabolites with a variety of possible (regulatory) functionsbeyondsimplybeingoxidants( 36,37).ItisthusworthconsideringwhetherH
2O2could
be a central regulatory metabolite in biomass conversion, the levels of which aretemporally and spatially regulated by the actions of substrate-specialized (and thuslocalized) H
2O2-producing and -consuming enzymes.
In this context, we wish to ﬁrst introduce the concept of LPMO catalysis by
presenting the monooxygenase (MO; O2-based) and peroxygenase (PO; H2O2-based)
reaction paradigms and discuss the knowns and unknowns. Then, a critical retrospecton LPMO literature is carried out with the aim of shedding new light on previouslyreported results. The second part of this review describes other H
2O2-producing or
-consuming systems encountered during lignocellulose conversion and discusses po-tential and proven interconnections in the light of available biochemical and multi-omics data. The last part of this review focuses on how our improving understandingof natural biomass conversion translates into the design of better industrial bioreﬁningprocesses, today and tomorrow.
RETROSPECT ON LPMO RESEARCH
Introduction to LPMO Catalysis: Knowns and Unknowns
The
present review does not aim to summarize all aspects of LPMOs, such as
structural aspects and putative mechanistic routes, since these have been comprehen-
sively covered in other recent reviews ( 12,17,18,24,38–42). Nevertheless, the recent
discovery
of the peroxygenase activity of LPMOs ( 32,34,43,44) shatters a widely
accepted
paradigm for LPMO catalysis that laid the foundations for previous discus-
sions and analyses. Therefore, a clariﬁcation of what has been explicitly proven andwhat remains hypothetical is required.
A conserved catalytic core embedded in an evolutionarily divergent binding surface.

close to the crystalline surface at the right location ( 45). Importantly, there is growing
evidence
that LPMOs also act on noncrystalline substrates ( 46–48) or copolymeric
structures
(25,49–51), indicating that substrate crystallinity is not a sine qua non
condition for LPMO catalysis to occur. Numerous crystallographic structures ( 39,52)
show
that LPMOs, irrespective of their phylogenetic origins and substrate speciﬁcities,
display rather ﬂat, solvent-exposed substrate-binding surfaces that include two con-served histidines coordinating a single copper atom, also known as a histidine brace(13). The histidine brace is the only totally conserved feature across the LPMO super-
family
(Fig.1).Othersurface-exposedresiduesinvolvedinsubstratebinding( 45,52–58)
and/or
the second coordination shell of the active-site copper are often relatively
conserved within phenotypic subgroups and therefore probably dictate complemen-tarity with the target substrate ( 39). Despite a few studies aimed at unraveling the
determinants 
of oxidative regioselectivity ( 56,59,60) and substrate speciﬁcity (61),
these
determinants remain largely unknown.
Some cellulose-active LPMOs are regiospeciﬁc (i.e., exclusively oxidizing the C-1 or
C-4 carbon), while others display a lack of speciﬁcity, oxidizing both C-1 and C-4
carbons. Notably, data on enzyme-substrate complexes ( 45,52) show that the C-1 and
C-4
carbonsarebothclosetothecoppersite,meaningthatminorvariationinsubstrate
positioning could lead to a change in oxidative regioselectivity, a notion that issupported by various studies (56, 60). It is intriguing that some LPMOs seemingly are
somewhat 
ambiguous when it comes to substrate binding and positioning, while
accurate assembly of the catalytic complex is crucial to control the very powerful redoxchemistry and to prevent off-pathway reactions, as explained in “Oxidative self-inactivation of LPMOs,” below.
The O
2reaction mechanism(s): oxidase and monooxygenase activities. The sem-
inal study by Vaaje-Kolstad et al. unraveled the oxidative activity of the chitin-activeCBP21, AA10A, from the bacterium Serratia marcescens (SmAA10A) by showing that
aldonic acids were released from chitin under aerobic conditions and in the presenceof reductant. Using mass spectrometry and labeled oxygen (
18O2), it was shown that
the introduced oxygen atom was derived from O2(11), and this was later also shown
for
a cellulose-active fungal LPMO, AA9E, from Neurospora crassa (NcAA9E-CBM1, also
known as NcPMO-08760) (16). The combined use of mass spectrometry and labeled
water
(H218O) showed that the detected aldonic acids result from spontaneous hydro-
lysis of a lactone form (11). The lactone form has been proposed to arise from a
spontaneous
elimination reaction that happens upon hydroxylation of the C-1 carbon
FIG 1LPMO active sites. The ﬁgure shows a close-up view of the catalytic center of SmAA10A (also known as CBP21; PDB
accession number 2BEM) (A), ScAA10C (also known as CelS2; PDB accession number 4OY7) (B), and TaAA9A (also known
asTaGH61A;PDBaccessionnumber 2YET)(C),whicharerepresentativesofbacterialchitin-active,bacterialcellulose-active,

triangle represents the equatorial plane deﬁned by the three copper-coordinating nitrogens in the histidine brace (best
visible in panel C). The red star indicates the location of an oxygen species observed in the neutron structural studies byO’Dell et al. (69), and the Glu/Gln potentially interacting with this oxygen species is underlined. Note that Phe187, Phe219,
and 
Tyr175 are in equivalent positions in their respective proteins, namely, the proximal axial coordination position. The
distal axial position is solvent exposed and will be occupied by substrate upon binding ( 52).Bissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

(16)(Fig. 2, right side). A similar mechanism is envisaged for C-4-oxidizing LPMOs, but
in
this case the product is a ketoaldose, which is hydrated to a gem-diol ( 14,62).
LPMOs
wereassignedasmonooxygenasesbasedon(i)themonooxygenatednature
of the reaction product, (ii) the apparent dependency of the reaction on O2and
reducing equivalents, and (iii) similarities with other copper-dependent enzymes
known as monooxygenases, in particular, methane monooxygenase ( 13,14). This
logical
reasoning has been widely accepted by the scientiﬁc community. However, it
has recently been pointed out that while the apparent O2dependency shows that O2
can be the source of the incorporated oxygen, this dependency is not a proof stricto
sensuthat O2is the cosubstrate of LPMOs since, in a reducing environment, O2-derived
intermediates such as superoxide or H2O2will be generated (32).
Among
the knowns, it has unambiguously been established that LPMOs are mono-
copper enzymes ( 13,14) which can catalyze the monooxygenation of several carbo-
hydrate
substrates (11, 13,14,25,46,47,62–65). It is also well known that the
LPMO-Cu(II)
stateistherestinginactivestateandthatreductionofthecopperprecedes
catalytic action. It is also established that in the absence of substrate and presence ofreductant, LPMOs can act as oxidases, i.e., that they are able to carry out the reductionof O
2(15), leading to H2O2formation (62, 66). Importantly, this implies that even in
reactions
with substrate, non-substrate-bound LPMOs that become reduced may gen-
erate H2O2, which could fuel H2O2-driven reactions catalyzed by substrate-bound
LPMOs (see below for more details).
While the ability of LPMOs to produce H2O2is well established, it is not clearly
establishedwhetherthesuperoxidespeciesresultingfromO2single-electronreduction
[by LPMO-Cu(I)] is released in the reaction mixture before undergoing spontaneousdisproportionation, as suggested by some density functional theory (DFT) calculations(15), or if H
2O2is produced in the LPMO active site. The latter scenario was recently
suggestedbySpanetal.,whonotedthatadditionofsuperoxidedismutase(SOD)toan

is sufﬁcient to complete a reaction cycle. Detailed potential catalytic pathways involving O2(17,18)o rH2O2(32) as a cosubstrate have
been
described elsewhere. Both pathways are thought to generate a hydroxylated end product (either at C-1 or C-4). The right-hand side
of the ﬁgure shows a C-1-hydroxylated product undergoing a spontaneous elimination reaction that leads to cleavage of the glycosidic
bond and formation of a lactone, which is hydrolyzed to become an aldonic acid.Oxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

AA9 LPMO reaction mixture had no effect on H2O2production (67). This would suggest
that
a second electron and two protons have to be delivered to the LPMO active site
to complete the two-electron reduction of O2to H2O2. Span et al. further showed that
a second-shell glutamine (Fig. 1) likely contributes to keeping the superoxide bound to
the
active site. In support of the latter observations, analysis of LPMO structural
diversity shows that a conserved second-shell glutamate or glutamine is pointing
toward the active site in all LPMOs, suggesting a key role in LPMO catalysis ( Fig. 1)(39).
Such
a role of this glutamine residue is also supported by recent quantum mechanics/
molecular mechanics (QM/MM) studies ( Fig. 1C)( 68). Accordingly, recent neutron
structures
ofNcAA9D from Neurospora crassa (also known as NcPMO-01050) indicate
that His157 and Gln166 (equivalent to His164 and Gln173 shown in Fig. 1C) interact
with
anequatoriallyboundoxygenspecies( 69).Similarequatorialbindingofanoxygen
species
has also been observed in a neutron structure of a bacterial AA10 LPMO ( 70).
Mutational
studies have shown that Glu60 in SmAA10A (54)( Fig. 1A) and Gln151 in
Thielavia
terrestrisAA9E (TtAA9E) (19) (equivalent to Gln173 in Thermoascus aurantiacus
AA9A [TaAA9A]) (Fig. 1C) are important for activity on chitin and cellulose degradation,
respectively.
Whilethisindicatesthatthestudiesonoxygenactivationdiscussedabove
arerelevantforunderstandingLPMOcatalysis,generally,greatcautionisneededwhenobservations made under substrate-free conditions are transposed to productive con-ditions (i.e., in the presence of substrate; see below). Of note, the acid/base chemistrythat may be exerted by second-sphere amino acid residues such as Glu60 in SmAA10A
or His164 in TaAA9A ( Fig. 1A) during O
2reduction and/or catalysis is not understood,
and no pKavalues for these residues have been reported.
One of the major challenges in understanding LPMO catalysis pertains to the
insoluble nature of natural substrates that constitutes a hurdle for the use of moststandard experimental approaches. In this respect, a landmark study has reported thecrystallographic resolution of the ﬁrst AA9 LPMO-oligosaccharide complex revealinginteractions between the enzyme and a soluble substrate ( 52). This study showed that
substrate
binding, expectedly, shields the copper ion from the solvent and that the
catalytic oxygen species must bind in the equatorial position. The latter was supportedby the presence of a chloride ion in the equatorial copper coordination position in theenzyme-substrate complex, which could mimic a reactive oxygen species. Frandsenetal.alsoconﬁrmedpreviousobservationsbyBorisovaetal.( 71)thatsubstratebinding
leads
to changes in copper coordination, as was also reported, more recently, for the
chitin-active SmAA10A ( 45), leading to the suggestion that substrate binding increases
the
catalyticcompetenceoftheenzyme.Thiswouldmakesensesinceitwouldhelpthe
enzyme to unleash its oxidative power only if substrate is present. Despite claimsindicating the opposite, still very little is known about polysaccharide cleavage byLPMOs. A key point to be taken from the work by Frandsen et al. and others is that theactive-siteenvironmentofanLPMOinsolutionisdifferentfromthatofanLPMOboundto a crystalline polysaccharide surface. Notably, conﬁnement of the active site uponcrystalline polysaccharide binding seems to restrict access to reactants, as indicated bysimulations suggesting formation of a gated tunnel connecting the active-site cavity tothe bulk solvent ( 45).
There
is clear and growing evidence (crystallographic, biochemical, and computa-
tional) for activation of O2in the absence of substrate, but there is no strong experi-
mentalproofforsuchactivationinthepresenceofaboundsubstrate(seereference 44
foraveryrecentdiscussion).Oneparticularlyintriguingissueconcernsthefactthatthemonooxygenase
reaction paradigm (R OH/H11001O2/H110012e/H11002/H110012H/H11001¡ROOH /H11001H2O)
requires that two electrons and two protons are recruited during catalysis. In the caseofanLPMO,theﬁrstelectroncanbestoredintheformofCu(I),butthesecondelectroneither has to be stored by the enzyme or timely supplied when required. In themono-copper and otherwise cofactor-free LPMO, a second electron could be derivedfrom transient residue-derived radicals, such as radicals observed for the modiﬁedtyrosine in galactose oxidase ( 72,73). A tyrosine, located in the axial direction (Fig. 1C),
is
conserved across fungal LPMOs and may play such a role, whereas a phenylalanineBissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

is usually found at the equivalent position in bacterial LPMOs. Alternatively, some
researchers have proposed an electron transport chain or channel that would allowdelivery of an electron to the substrate-bound LPMO ( 17,18)(Fig. 2, option a). The
existence 
of such an electron channel has so far not been established, and there are no
conserved sequence features among LPMOs that could support the existence of sucha channel.
It is worth noting that the monooxygenase reaction also requires the proper supply
of two protons and that nothing is known about how this could happen. Knowledgeabout second-sphere residues’ acid/base chemistry and proton networks ( 67) will be
useful
to elucidate this.
The H2O2reaction mechanism(s): peroxygenase and peroxidase activities. Re-
cently,ithasbeenproposedthatthemonooxygenaseparadigmappliedtoLPMOsmayneedtoberevisedbasedonexperimentsshowingthatH

reactions. Importantly, inhibition of LPMO catalysis by a H2O2-scavenging enzyme
(horseradish peroxidase [HRP]) under standard reaction conditions (i.e., excess of O2
andreductant)suggestedthatO2isaprecursormoleculeforthetruecosubstrate,H2O2
(32,33).Accordingly,itwasalsoshownthatH2O2-drivenreactionsaremuchfasterthan
O2-driven reactions and that the enzymes prefer H2O2over O2in competition experi-
ments. The ability of H2O2to promote fast AA9 LPMO catalysis has recently been
conﬁrmed in independent experiments by Hangasky et al. ( 44). Bissaro et al. (32, 33)
concluded
that H2O2is not just an alternative to O2but that it is the catalytically
relevant cosubstrate of the polysaccharide oxidation by different LPMOs, which wouldthus act as peroxygenases (R OH/H11001H
2O2¡ROOH /H11001H2O). This conclusion has been
debated in the ﬁeld (44, 74) and still needs more proof, but the ability of H2O2to drive
fast AA9 and AA10 LPMO reactions is now well proven.
The proposed H2O2-based mechanism entails an initial reduction from LPMO-Cu(II)
to Cu(I), termed the priming reduction. The reduced enzyme reacts in a controlled andsubstrate-associated manner with H
2O2to unleash the intrinsic oxidative power of the
latter. This leads to hydroxylation of the substrate, concomitant release of a watermolecule, and regeneration of the LPMO-Cu(I) state, which can enter a new catalyticcycle (Fig. 2, option b). It is important to note that the redox state of the LPMO has not
been
experimentally monitored along the reaction. The concept of the priming reduc-
tion has mainly been deduced from the observation that suprastoichiometric amountsof oxidized products (relative to the reductant) were generated when the AA10 LPMOwas supplied with H
2O2, indicating that a reduced LPMO catalyzes multiple turnovers
(32). Of note, such substoichiometric consumption of reductant is not compatible with
the
originally proposed O2-dependent reaction mechanism ( Fig. 2).
The
nature of the most likely reactive oxygen species emerging during catalysis
remains a matter of discussion for both the O2and the H2O2mechanisms (32, 42,44,
74). One route proposed for the H2O2reaction mechanism (32) involves a [CuO/H11001] core
intermediateasthespeciescatalyzingthehydrogenatomabstractionfromtheglycosylunit (Fig. 2). Earlier QM/MM calculations, in the working frame of an O
2reaction
mechanism, also suggested that the [CuO/H11001] intermediate would be the relevant
catalyticspecies(68, 75,76).Still,othermechanisms,suchasamechanisminvolvingthe
formation
of a H2O2-derived hydroxyl radical as oxidant, cannot be excluded ( 32,44).
While
mechanistic details remain to be elucidated, it is worth noting that the H2O2
mechanism solves the conundrum of second-electron delivery discussed above. H2O2
carries both the protons and reducing equivalents necessary for LPMO catalysis tooccur.
Prompted by the discovery of H
2O2-driven LPMO catalysis in 2016 (32, 33), several
follow-up
studies have recently appeared. A detailed kinetic study of the peroxygen-
ation of chitin by SmAA10A yielded a catalytic constant of 6.7 s/H110021and a Kmof 2.8 /H9262M,
suggesting high afﬁnity for H2O2(34). The resulting catalytic efﬁciency, in the range of
106M/H110021·s/H110021, is similar to catalytic efﬁciencies typically reported for peroxygenases
(77). In another study, Breslmayr et al. used 2,6-dimethoxyphenol as chromogenic
substrate
and H2O2as a cosubstrate to assess the peroxidase activity of several AA9s,Oxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

yielding catalytic rates varying from 0.9 to 18.6 s/H110021(43). Two different QM/MM studies
have
shown that the peroxygenase reaction is plausible from a theoretical point of
view, with low overall energy barriers and involving a [CuO/H11001] intermediate as oxidant
(74,78).
Using
a fungal AA9 active on cellohexaose, Hangasky et al. found much higher
reactivity with H2O2as a cosubstrate (4.75 to 15.25 s/H110021) than with O2(0.28 s/H110021)(44),
thus
conﬁrming the ﬁndings by Bissaro et al. Interestingly, despite a difference of four
ordersofmagnitudeinthecatalyticefﬁcienciesobservedwithH2O2(106M/H110021·s/H110021)(34)
and
O2(102M/H110021·s/H110021)(44), based on additional experiments, these authors concluded
that
O2may still be the most relevant and natural cosubstrate.
Regarding the stoichiometry of the reaction, data obtained for H2O2-driven LPMO
reactions support a 1:1 molar ratio between consumed H2O2and produced oxidized
sugars for both AA9 and AA10 cellulose-active ( 32,44) and AA10 chitin-active ( 34)
LPMOs.
No equivalent data are available for O2-driven reactions although one may
expect a similar 1:1 stoichiometry in a system where nonproductive events are mini-
mized (e.g., reduction of O2to water). All in all, accumulating experimental evidence
suggests that, in the presence of substrate, AA9 and AA10 LPMOs react much moreefﬁcientlywithH
2O2thanwithO2.ThequestionofwhetherLPMOsatalluseO2directly,
thatis,withoutpriorreductiontoH2O2,remainstobesettled.Importantly,asdescribed
in the following sections, there are plenty of sources of H2O2in lignocellulolytic
environments.
The carbohydrate intermediate species. Little is known about the carbohydrate
intermediates potentially occurring along the reaction pathway since the substrateradical resulting from hydrogen abstraction and the subsequent hydroxylated prod-
uct have never been experimentally observed. It is not known either whether themolecular rearrangement induced by the destabilizing hydroxylation, which leadsto glycosidic bond cleavage and lactone formation, occurs spontaneously in thereaction mixture or in an enzyme-assisted manner. Recent calculations, however,suggest that hydroxylation-induced glycosidic bond cleavage can occur in theabsence of enzyme ( 74). This mechanistic ambiguity is at the origin of the debate
on
the relevance of the term “lytic” in the LPMO acronym and explains why some
choose to call these enzymes PMOs ( 18). The term lytic is meant to indicate the fact
that
bond cleavage occurs, which contrasts with most other monooxygenases,
which tend to catalyze oxy-functionalization but not cleavage of their substrates.
Oxidative self-inactivation of LPMOs. A key aspect of LPMO catalysis pertains to
operationalstability,aparameterthatisofhighimportanceinindustrial,biological,andchemical contexts. When analyzing the literature, one can observe that a correlationcan be established between poor substrate binding and rapid enzyme inactivation ( 56,
79–81). We know today that this enzyme inactivation is due to oxidative self-
inactivation
of the LPMO and that oxidative damage of the enzyme is conﬁned to the
active site, notably the copper-coordinating histidines ( 32). These suicide reactions can
be
prevented by productive substrate binding ( 32,34,44). In studies with H2O2as a
cosubstrate, Kuusk et al. showed that the rate of inactivation of SmAA10A in the
absence of substrate was about 1,000 times lower than the rate of substrate cleavagein reactions with substrate ( 34).
In 
general, it is thus extremely important to have full control of the reduction state
of the LPMO during its handling (i.e., protein extraction, puriﬁcation, storage, andreaction setup) since accidental reduction of the copper center in the absence of theproper substrate and in the presence of O
2or H2O2will lead to enzyme oxidative
self-inactivationandthustononfunctionalprotein.Itmustbenotedthatanoxidativelydamaged LPMO will still look normal on an SDS-PAGE gel and that the damage thusmay remain undetected and lead to false conclusions as to the activity of the enzymein question. To cope with such issues, several precautions could be envisaged, such asusing of metal chelators (e.g., EDTA) to remove the copper ion while the enzyme is notused, working under anaerobic conditions, or avoiding reducing conditions. Researchpertaining to the control of these inactivation processes will likely be a topic ofBissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

investigation in the near future, notably by seeking inspiration from the ﬁelds of
peroxidases and peroxygenases that face similar problems ( 82).
What
is in the name? Asmentionedintheintroduction,overtime,LPMOshavehad
several names. Today, the term LPMO is widely accepted, and most researchers nametheir LPMOs as XxLPMOnX or XxAAnX, where Xxindicates the source microbe (e.g., Nc
forNeurospora crassa), n indicates the LPMO family according to CAZy (currently 9, 10,
11, 13, 14, or 15), and X is a capital letter that is assigned to multiple LPMOs from acertain organism, often by the order of their functional characterization or the order oftheir gene numbers in the genome. Considering the recent discoveries on the role ofH
2O2, the term LPMO may need revision. While including peroxygenase (PO) in the
name (e.g., LPPO) may appear premature, the existing term monooxygenase (MO),which by deﬁnition implies O
2as a cosubstrate, seems incorrect. Informal discussions
among scholars have led to the suggestion to use the more general term oxidase torefer to LPMOs. The term LPO, for lytic polysaccharide oxidase, entails a simple changerelative to LPMO, does not assume the nature of the cosubstrate, and includes theindisputable ability of LPMOs to generate H
2O2(which is an oxidase reaction). On the
other hand, the term oxidase does not reﬂect the fact that an oxygen atom isincorporated into the ﬁnal product, and in that sense “oxygenase” appears moreappropriate. Discussions, debates, and scientiﬁc progress should allow sorting out this
issue in the near future.
In the following sections, we revisit previously published studies on LP(M)Os to
pinpoint overlooked incoherencies or unexplained phenomena that ﬁnd sense in theframe of the peroxygenase paradigm for LPMO action.
A Wide Diversity of Reductants
LPMO reductants and associated catalytic rates. It has been demonstrated that
LPMOs can be activated by a wide diversity of reductants ( Table 1). These include
organic
compounds such as ascorbic acid (AscA) (11), cysteine (48, 65), reduced
glutathione
(11), and a wide range of plant- and fungus-derived phenols ( 65,83), as
well
as lignin and fragments thereof ( 84–86). Functional reductants also include enzy-
matic
systemssuchascellobiosedehydrogenase(CDH)(seesubsection“TheCDHCase:
a Multifunctional Redox Partner,” below) or photocatalytic systems ( 87,88) (see sub-
section
“Stimulation of LPMO Activity by Photocatalytic Systems,” below). The ability of
CDH to drive fungal AA9 LPMO reactions was detected early in the development of the
ﬁeld(14,64).Itshouldbenotedthatanequivalentnaturalenzymaticredoxpartnerhas
not
yet been found in bacteria.
The highly surface-exposed active sites of LPMOs are unusual and may explain the
apparent absence of reductant speciﬁcity. Nevertheless, taking into account the factthat the reductants listed above display very different sizes and topologies, as well aselectrostaticorhydrophobicityproperties,itappearsintriguingthattheycanalldirectlyreduce the LPMO copper center. Of note, redox partner diversity has also beenobserved for cytochrome P450 monooxygenases ( 89). Both for P450 monooxygenases
(90)andLPMOs(83)acorrelationbetweenthereductionpotentialoftheredoxpartner
and
the reduction rate of the enzyme has been established. Also, it has been reported
that an increase in pH led to a decrease in reduction potential of the reductant and toan increase in AA9 LPMO initial rates ( 91).
Importantly, 
nocorrelationhaseverbeenestablishedbetweentherateofreduction
of LPMOs (per millisecond range) and the apparent catalytic rate (per minute range),which is orders of magnitude lower. Assuming the O
2-based mechanism, this remark-
able discrepancy in rates indicates that transfer of the second electron, the rate ofwhich cannot be measured directly, is rate limiting and affected by the reductant type.Alternatively, in the H
2O2-based mechanism, priming reduction of the copper may not
be rate limiting, and the dependency of the LPMO catalytic rate on the reductant mayreﬂect different potentials of each reducing system to generate and/or accumulateH
2O2.Table 1shows an overview of available kinetic data for a large diversity of LPMO
substrates
and reductants. Importantly, with a few exceptions, the apparent enzymeOxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

rates are low and fall in a relatively narrow window roughly between 1 and 10 min/H110021.
MuchhigherLPMOrates(intherangeof1to10persecond)havebeenobtainedintwo

of
LPMOActivitybyPhotocatalyticSystems,”below)and(ii)whenH2O2isusedtodrive
thereaction(32, 34,44).DeterminationofLPMOratesisgenerallycomplicatedbecause
of
the inactivation processes discussed above. In reactions with added H2O2, the LPMO
catalytic rate depends on the H2O2supply rate, but saturation kinetics may not be
reached before inactivation phenomena occur, which is a common problem encoun-tered in the ﬁeld of H
2O2-using enzymes (82). Of note, when available kinetic data for
LPMOs
are evaluated (Table 1), it is important to consider that in most studies only the
carbohydrate
substrate concentration was controlled, whereas neither the identity nor
the quantity of the oxygen-containing cosubstrate was known or controlled.
Almost all rates listed in Table 1are apparent rates and not true kinetic parameters.
As
a consequence, the listed rates for various substrates cannot be used to draw any
conclusions as to the substrate speciﬁcity of LPMOs. In fact, whereas LPMOs arethought to have evolved primarily to attack crystalline substrates ( 11,29), the true
substrate 
preferences of LPMOs, e.g., in terms of kcat/Kmvalues, remain unknown.TABLE 1 (Continued)

If one assumes that the H2O2-mechanism is valid, production of H2O2was likely the rate-limiting step in many of the reported experiments with solid substrates, but

ROS as reductants. It has been shown that superoxide (O2˙/H11002), the product of O2
single-electronreduction(Fig.3),canreduceandthusactivateAA10LPMOs,whileH2O2
cannot (32). Therefore, superoxide constitutes a possible electron shuttle between a
reductant
and the LPMO active site, as has been shown for myeloperoxidases ( 92).
Many
photosystems display the appropriate reduction potential to catalyze production
ofsuperoxide( 93).Also,O2˙/H11002canbeproducedbyawiderangeofoxidases( 94)andcan
emerge
in reactions involving semiquinones ( 95), which are intermediates between
hydroquinones
and quinones, all abundant in biomass-degrading ecosystems ( 96).
Notably,
O2˙/H11002will spontaneously disproportionate to H2O2in protic solvents such as
H2O,decreasingitslifetimeasanLPMOreductantbutgeneratinganLPMOcosubstrate.
This disproportionation process can be accelerated by ascorbic acid ( 97,98)o rb y
phenolics
present in biomass (see subsection “Nonenzymatic Production and Use of
H2O2,” below). Notably, in the H2O2-dependent mechanism, only a priming reduction
is needed, meaning that small amounts of O2˙/H11002could be sufﬁcient to activate LPMOs.
To complicate things, it is known that reduced LPMOs can catalyze the single-
electronreductionofO2intoO2˙/H11002(15),whicheventuallyresultsinH2O2.Inlightofthis,
it is worth noting the single electron reduction potentials of H2O2(E0/H11005/H110010.38 V) and
O2(/H110020.33 V) (Fig. 3)( 99,100), which suggests that single-electron transfer from
LPMO-Cu(I)
would be more thermodynamically favorable for H2O2than for O2. Indeed,
the18O competition experiments alluded to above (32) clearly showed that AA10

of a hydroxyl radical after a single-electron reduction [e.g., by Fe(II) or by Cu(I), i.e., Fenton reactions] or

LPMO reactions. Indeed, such enzymes are found together with LPMOs in biomass-
degrading ecosystems (see Insights into the Network of Lignocellulolytic Redox Reac-tions).
How much reducing power is needed to fuel LPMOs? An intriguing aspect of
LPMO biochemistry pertains to observed dose-response relationships for the reductant(102). In most experiments published so far under standard conditions (aerobic, reduc-
tant,
and no added H2O2) molar enzyme/reductant ratios were in the 1:10,000 range
(Table 1). One may wonder why variation in such a large excess of reductant inﬂuences
the
catalytic rate of the LPMO, knowing that LPMO reduction is a fast process (83). One
possible
answer is that the reductant, in addition to reducing the LPMO, is involved in
the generation of the H2O2whose availability is rate limiting for the reaction. Alterna-
tively,inanO2-basedmechanism,thereductantconcentrationcouldaffectthedelivery
rate for the second electron (see above).

that O2consumption in the absence of LPMO increased when the concentration of
AscA increased (104). It is important to note that generated H2O2may engage in all
kinds of redox reactions, for example, those involving free metals ( 105) or phenolic
compounds
present in the lignocellulosic substrate. In this respect, LPMO experimen-
talists have certainly noticed variability and reproducibility issues when they compareddifferent batches of substrate or used different batches of reductant.
If one wishes to control LPMO reactions, it is of utmost importance to control the
levels of reductant and oxygen species, which, considering all the possible reactions, isa major challenge. One way of reaching such control is to run reactions anaerobically,withsmallamountsofreductantandasteady,slowsupplyofH

are run with O2, current data indicate that, instead of using small-molecule reductants,
it is better to use a source of reducing equivalents that is less prone to uncontrollable
auto-oxidation, such as a dehydrogenase and its substrate ( 102) or photocatalytic
systems
(33,87,88). Such systems are discussed below.
Why
LPMOs Do Not Seem To Produce H2O2in the Presence of Substrate
The binding of an LPMO to its target substrate is thought to be controlled by
structural properties of the enzyme surface ( 45,52) and, in the case of multimodular
LPMOs,
by appended CBMs (12, 39). Substrate binding has also been suggested to be
inﬂuenced
by other players of the LPMO reaction since cyanide and chloride, both
mimics of superoxide, increase binding ( 52,55). Current data suggest that binding is
strengthened
by formation of a ternary complex with substrate and an oxygen species.
Available data show that the extent of LPMO binding varies a lot. For AA10
chitin-active LPMOs, the bound fraction has been reported to lie between 80% or more(54,81) and down to 40% (106) or 19% (107). Regarding cellulose-active LPMOs, one
can 
ﬁndqualitativeestimationsforboundfractionsspanningfromca.100%bound(for
a full-length enzyme with CBM) (80) to 40% (108). Thus, in most cases, a signiﬁcant
fraction
of the LPMO is not bound to the substrate and is free in solution.
As noted above, H2O2accumulates in LPMO reactions that lack substrate ( 62,66,
103). This is usually considered a futile reaction, also known as an uncoupling reaction.
In
the presence of the appropriate substrate, such LPMO-mediated H2O2production is
not observed, and this is usually attributed to the fact that the catalytically competent
LPMO acts on the substrate rather than being engaged into the uncoupling reaction.However, one may wonder why the unbound fractions of LPMOs apparently do notproduce H
2O2. For instance, in the case of the fungal NcAA9C-CBM1, no H2O2was
detected in reaction mixtures containing 5 mM Glc6(62) although 14% of the enzymes
were
probablyfreeinsolution,givena Kd(dissociationconstant)valueforthissubstrate
of 0.81 mM (71). One possible explanation is that reduced LPMOs are never free in
solution
becausetheybindmuchmorestronglytothesubstratethansuggestedbythe
Kdvalue, which was determined in the absence of reductant. This explanation is
supported by a recent report showing that LPMO-Cu(I) binds cellulose more stronglythan LPMO-Cu(II) ( 109), but also in this case, binding did not seem complete. In any
case, 
strong and even 100% binding of the reduced LPMO cannot account for the
completeabsenceofH2O2since,undertheconditionsused,H2O2willalsobeproduced
by non-LPMO-catalyzed reactions involving the reductant, O2, and transition metals in
solution.
An obvious alternative explanation for these observations follows from the H2O2
mechanism,whichdictatesthatH2O2producedbynon-LPMO-catalyzedreactionsorby
unbound LPMOs is readily consumed by bound LPMOs carrying out H2O2-driven
catalysis on the substrate. In this scenario, the very low H2O2concentrations observed
in LPMO reaction mixtures containing substrate are hiding production and consump-tion ﬂuxes ( Fig. 5).
The
CDH Case: a Multifunctional Redox Partner?
It is now well established that fungal CDHs, which are more common in white-rot
fungi than brown-rot fungi ( 110), can promote AA9 LPMO activity (14, 64). Genomic
cooccurrence
and coexpression of CDH along with AA9 LPMOs is often observed ( 18,
83). Knocking out the cdhgene leads to lower efﬁciency of the cellulolytic secretome
(14)andhasalsobeenshowntopromoteputativelycompensatorymechanismsbythe
fungus,
such as the secretion of additional /H9252-glucosidases as well as AA3_2 ﬂavo-
oxidases (111). A plethora of roles have been proposed for CDHs throughout the last
decades,
one of them being reduction of transition metals [e.g., Fe(III)] and generation
of H2O2to drive hydroxyl radical-generating Fenton reactions ( 112–116) (see subsec-
tion
“NonenzymaticProductionandUseofH2O2,”below).Ofnote,theH2O2production
ability varies between CDHs and is pH and substrate dependent ( 117,118) but is
relatively
low (119–122) compared to that of classical oxidases (Fig. 4; see also Table S1Bissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews
December 2018 Volume 82 Issue 4 e00029-18 mmbr.asm.org 14 on October 4, 2019 by guest http://mmbr.asm.org/ Downloaded from 
in the supplemental material). This low rate led scholars to adopt the name cellobiose
dehydrogenase (CDH) instead of the initial cellobiose oxidase (CBO) ( 123).
Today,
thereisstrongevidencethatCDHconstitutesanaturalredoxpartnerforAA9
LPMOs (55,124,125) although the exact mode of interplay still needs to be fully
elucidated,
including the second-electron conundrum in the O2-based LPMO mecha-
nism. Considering the recent doubts concerning this mechanism, it is worthwhile torevisit some of the available kinetic data for CDHs and their interplay with LPMOs.
CDHs are bi-modular redox enzymes belonging to the superfamily of glucose-
methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.99.18) containing a ﬂavin adeninedinucleotide (FAD)-dependent dehydrogenase domain (DH; AA3_1 subfamily) and acytochrome domain (Cyt; family AA8) connected by a ﬂexible linker allowing mobilitybetween the two domains. The DH domain constitutes the catalytic part of the enzymewhere a two-electron oxidation of the substrate (cellobiose and several other oligo-saccharides) reduces the ﬂavin cofactor (FAD /H110012e
/H11002/H110012H/H11001¡FADH2). Reoxidation of
the ﬂavin may happen by reduction of a two-electron acceptor (e.g., dichloropheno-lindophenol [DCPIP], benzoquinone, or O
2) or by sequential single-electron transfer to
the Cyt domain (126). It is known that the reduced Cyt domain can transfer electrons
to
AA9 and AA10 LPMOs ( 102,124). The existence of a CDH binding site on a fungal
AA9
LPMO has been suggested (127), but theoretical considerations (42) and lack of
sequence
conservation in the proposed docking site ( 125), as well as studies of
interactions
between CDH and an AA9 LPMO by computational modeling ( 124)o r
nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) (55), rather support direct electron transfer at the
copper
site.
The reoxidation of the reduced DH by direct (from the FAD) ( Fig. 5) and indirect (via
Cyt)
(not shown in Fig. 5) reduction of O2is slow, with observed rates typically being
intheorderof10/H110021to10/H110022and10/H110022to10/H110023s/H110021,respectively(128–130)( Fig.4).Ithas

chemical reactions, whereas solid arrows indicate diffusion. IET stands for internal electron transfer; blue and orange indicate reduced and oxidized states,
respectively. The blue frame shows a system generating reducing equivalents that both produce H2O2and serve to reduce the LPMO. The reduced LPMO (red
frame) is in equilibrium between the bound and unbound forms and will either generate H2O2(uncoupling reaction, kobs,O2) or oxidize a polysaccharide. Here,
the blue frame depicts a CDH system (see subsection “The CDH Case: a Multifunctional Redox Partner” for a detailed explanation), but this system could bereplaced by several alternative reducing systems. In the ﬁgure, from left to right, rates are shown as follows: for cellobiose oxidation with O
2being the electron
acceptor (102); for the reduction (kFAD-red) of the ﬂavin (FAD)-containing DH domain (83, 124,391); for LPMO reduction (83, 102,124); for H2O2generation by
CDH (102, 117,119,129–131). The apparent rates of LPMO-catalyzed reactions are given in Tables 1 and S1. Note that LPMO reduction (kLPMO-red) by CDH-Cyt
obeys pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics and depends on the LPMO concentration (102). Thus, for comparative purposes, the kLPMO-redrange is given for 1 /H9262M LPMO
(a common concentration in most published assays). Note that the catalytic constant for H2O2-driven polysaccharide oxidation by LPMOs (kcat,H2O2) is much
higher than the apparent rate constant, derived from standard reactions without added H2O2(kobs). In the latter reactions H2O2generation is rate limiting for
LPMO action.Oxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

more prone to reduction (E0/H11015/H11001250 mV versus SHE). Note that the total spin is
conserved for the reduced cytochrome reaction with both LPMO-Cu(II) and O2. Under
standard conditions (i.e., 1 /H9262M LPMO) the LPMO reduction rate by reduced Cyt lies in
the range of 10 to 200 min/H110021(83,102,124), which is one to two orders of magnitude
faster
than reported LPMO catalytic rates ( Fig. 5andTable 1). Therefore, the initial
reduction
step probably does not constitute a rate-limiting step in CDH-driven LPMO
catalysis.However,CDHdoesplayarate-limitingroleundercertainconditions,asithas
been shown that increasing the amount of CDH activity in a reaction increases AA10LPMO activity ( 102).
Taken 
together, the existing data on the interactions between CDH and AA9 and
AA10 LPMOs may seem to suggest that delivery of the second electron is rate limiting.However, this reasoning requires reconsideration in light of a possible role of H
2O2in
LPMO catalysis. Incubation of CDH with a substrate (e.g., lactose) in the absence of anelectron acceptor will lead to the production of H
2O2, whereas such production
seemingly does not happen when the reaction mixture also contains an LPMO and itssubstrate. The common explanation for the disappearance of H
2O2when the LPMO is
presentrequiresthatthereducingequivalentsacquiredbyCDHuponlactoseoxidationare preferentially transferred to the LPMO rather than to O
2. Such a conclusion,
however, is questionable given the abundance of O2(ca. 250 /H9262M) versus that of LPMO
(1/H9262M), suggesting that the balance between both processes may be less tilted in favor
of LPMO reduction than usually thought. Moreover, it has been shown that the rate ofH
2O2production by the lactose/CDH system in the absence of LPMO plus substrate (1
to 10 min/H110021) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) is remarkably similar to the
LPMO (AA10) oxidative rate when the latter is fueled by the lactose/CDH system ( Table
1)(102,128). This observation may, of course, be due to coincidence but does suggest
that
therate-limitingstepinCDH-drivenLPMOcatalysisistheformationofH2O2,which
does not accumulate because it is consumed by the LPMO.
Comparing the high reduction rate of the FAD domain (by electrons derived from
oligosaccharide oxidation) with all other rates of subsequent reactions in the CDHsystem (Fig. 5) shows that the rate of reoxidation of CDH is determining the overall
turnover 
rate and that this rate is driven by the nature of the electron acceptor and its
ability to accept electrons from CDH (Table S1) ( 125). In the CDH-LPMO systems, there
is
a mismatch between the (relatively high) electron-donating capacity of CDH and the
(relatively low) electron consumption by the LPMO. Thus, electrons will inevitably berouted from the reduced dehydrogenase domain toward O
2, leading to slow H2O2
generation. The similar rates of H2O2generation by the CDH and of CDH-driven LPMO

the
poor oxidase activity (i.e., slow H2O2generation) and the more efﬁcient dehydro-
genase activity (i.e., reducing equivalent generation) of CDHs may both be biologicallyrelevant.
Stimulation of LPMO Activity by Photocatalytic Systems
In 2016, two photocatalytic systems were reported to promote LPMO activity. First,
Cannella et al. showed that AA9 LPMOs can be fueled by the combined use of a
pigment (e.g., chlorophyllin) and a reductant (e.g., AscA) when exposed to (low-intensity) visible light ( 87). This approach resulted in an impressive boost in LPMO
activity,
reaching rates that were 10- to 100-fold faster than those of reference exper-
iments under standard conditions. The authors of this study proposed that high redoxpotential electrons, generated by the photoexcited pigment, would be at the origin ofLPMOactivationandtherateenhancement.Inthissystem,thereductantwouldmerelyserve to regenerate the electron pool of the pigment.

oxide,whichrequiresalowreductionpotential,i.e.,ahighreducingstrength(O2/H110011e/H11002
|O2˙/H11002;E0/H11005/H110020.33 V) (Fig. 3). Bissaro et al. showed that superoxide is formed when
chlorophyllin
is exposed to (high-intensity) light (in the absence of reductant) and that
superoxide can activate an AA10 LPMO ( 33). When a reductant (AscA) is added to the
system,
a dramatic boost in LPMO activity was observed ( 33), thus conﬁrming the
original
work by Cannella et al. (87). However, based on several experiments, Bissaro
et
al. claimed that this boost was correlated to the fact that AscA accelerated the
conversion of superoxide into H2O2(33), which will speed up LPMO catalysis (32, 34,
44). In a follow-up study, the idea of ROS being involved in the photocatalytically
promoted
LPMO activity was dismissed, mainly on the basis of the absence of effects
of the addition of catalase on AA9 LPMO activity (132). It could be argued that the lack
of
a catalase effect could be due to the micromolar afﬁnity for H2O2of LPMOs (32, 34),
which
likely enables these enzymes to compete with catalases that have apparent Km
values in the millimolar range (see “The housekeeping role of catalases,” below). The
issue remains controversial, and a direct comparison of the two studies is complicated,primarily due to the use of different light intensities ( 33,87). More work is required to
decipher 
the underlying mechanism of light/pigment-driven LPMO catalysis.
In the same year, 2016, it was also shown that light-driven oxidation of water,
catalyzed by vanadium-doped titanium dioxide (V-TiO2), can provide the reducing
equivalents that LPMOs need to oxidize polysaccharides, thus alleviating the need forexternally added electron donors (88). This proof of concept yielded much lower LPMO
rates 
than the chlorophyllin system described above (tested for both AA9 and AA10)
(Table 1). With hindsight, it is likely that the light-driven LPMO activity observed in this
study
reﬂected light-driven production of H2O2, which is a known ability of photoex-
cited TiO2-based photocatalysts (133–136). Indeed, the ability of TiO2to catalyze
light-driven peroxygenase reactions has recently been demonstrated using the unspe-ciﬁc peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita as a model enzyme (137).
INSIGHTS INTO THE NETWORK OF LIGNOCELLULOLYTIC REDOX REACTIONS
Ourunderstandingofbiomassconversioninnaturalenvironments,notablybyfungi
(4), is constantly challenged and improved, as illustrated by the relatively recent
discovery
of LPMOs (10, 11). As reviewed by Berrin et al. (138) and others (139), several
studies
conducted during the past few years have reported biomass-dependent up-
regulation of LPMO expression or secretion by many fungi: Hypocrea jecorina (140),
Myceliophthora
thermophila (141), Schizophyllum commune, Phanerochaete chrysospo-
rium, Gloeophyllum trabeum (142), Aspergillus nidulans (143), Phanerochaete carnosa

(148), Phlebia radiata (149), Podospora anserina (111), and Neurospora crassa(150).
Beyond
an array of well-known hydrolases, fungi tend to coexpress/cosecrete a pleth-
ora of other oxidoreductases along with LPMOs, and many of these generate or
consume H2O2. The ability of H2O2to efﬁciently drive LPMO catalysis sheds new light

The
Function of Lignocellulolytic Oxidoreductases
From an evolutionary perspective. Our current understanding of the role of
different oxidoreductases involved in lignocellulose conversion is essentially de-rived from studies on two kinds of living laboratories, namely, wood-decayingbasidiomycetes commonly classiﬁed as white-rot or brown-rot fungi. The differencein appearance of the rotted wood is a direct consequence of the depolymerizationstrategy adopted by either fungus, which reﬂects the enzymatic arsenal that thefungi deploy ( Fig. 7). Notably, fungi with hybrid phenotypes, sometimes called gray
rot,
have been described previously ( 151). With the exception of hemicellulases,
which
are equally abundant in the genomes of both types of fungi, the two fungalOxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

types have quite different enzyme arsenals. In particular, white-rot fungi have more
laccases, cellulases, and lignin-active peroxidases than brown-rot fungi. It has beenproposed that the ﬁrst wood-rotting fungi appeared through acquisition of ligni-nolytic peroxidases ( 110) by ancestral basidiomycetes, whereas the later transition

act sequentially, depending on the microorganism or the nature of the biomass. The main nonenzymatic weapon is constituted by Fenton reaction-derived hydroxyl
radicals (step 1). The lignin fraction, which constitutes a physical barrier, can be modiﬁed and to some extent depolymerized via the action of enzymes such asperoxidases (step 2) or laccases (step 3). Note that the peroxidases and laccases are also involved in repolymerization of lignin (not shown). These enzymes can alsocatalyzetheoxidationofmediatorsthatmaybeinvolvedinligninoxidation(step3= ;shownonlyforlaccases).Themaincellulasesareendoglucanases(EGs)(e.g.,Cel7B)

/H9252-glucosidases (BG) (step 6). The various cellulases will also release minor
amounts of products carrying an oxidation at C-1 or C-4 that was introduced by an LPMO (the presence of such oxidations is indicated by a red star).

(step 
8), and acquired reducing equivalents can be used to generate H2O2(step 8=) or be transferred to the cytochrome (Cyt) domain (step 8/H11033 ), which then reduces
LPMOs (step 9). Once reduced, LPMOs can oxidize the cellulose (step 10), provided that the cosubstrate H2O2(or O2) is present. (As noted elsewhere in this review,
the question of whether O2can act as a cosubstrate without prior reduction to H2O2is still under debate [44].) LPMOs can also be activated by single-domain
dehydrogenases
and/ornoncovalentlyboundreducedcofactor(step11to12)orbyreducedphenolics(step13).Single-domaindehydrogenases(step14)andreduced
phenolics (especially in the presence of transition metals [M]) (step 15) can also lead to the production of H2O2under aerobic conditions. Several oxidases (Ox) such
as methanol oxidase, glyoxal oxidase, copper radical oxidase, or diverse oligosaccharide oxidases can generate H2O2(step 16) to fuel the different H2O2-consuming
systems (here, a secreted pyranose 2-oxidase is shown) (see subsection “The Function of Lignocellulolytic Oxidoreductases”). Aryl-alcohol oxidases (AAO) oxidizelignin-derived compounds to generate H
2O2(step 17). Catalase acts as a safety belt by converting excess H2O2into H2O and O2(step 18). Expansins/swollenins (SWO)
may contribute to lignocellulolysis by loosening the plant cell wall structure, also called amorphogenesis (step 19) (282) although their mode of action remainsunknown.

from white-rot to brown-rot decay among fungi involved the loss of lignin peroxi-
dases but maintenance of oxidases ( 152–154).
The
oxidases that are maintained in all wood-decaying fungi are well-known H2O2
producers and belong to the superfamilies of glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxi-doreductases (AA3) or copper radical oxidases (CRO; AA5). Among AA3s, aryl-alcoholoxidases (AAO), glucose oxidases (GOX), and alcohol oxidases (AOX) are phylogeneti-cally the most related enzymes, followed by pyranose 2-oxidase (P2O) and CDH, whichshare the oldest ancestor with other GMC oxidoreductases ( 155). In white-rot fungi, an
obvious
role for these oxidases is to fuel lignin peroxidases with H2O2. In brown-rot
fungi, which lack lignin peroxidases, H2O2may be used to drive the Fenton systems
that are unique for these fungi. Importantly, Fenton systems may not be the only H2O2
sink since there is a strong cooccurrence of AA9 LPMOs and AA3-encoding genes inbrown-rotfungi(83),andweknownowthatLPMOsefﬁcientlyuseH

For each group offungi, the plus and minus symbols indicate whether the number of genes is higher or lower than that of at least one of the other two groups. An equal signindicates that the numbers are similar in all three groups, whereas the null symbol (ø) indicates the absence of any gene encoding a given type of (known)oxidoreductase. For each species, the number of genes encoding the major cellulases (GH6 and GH7), hemicellulases (GH10, -11, -16, -51, -62, and -74), CDH(AA3_1), laccases (AA1_1), peroxidases (AA2), and main secreted H

Riley et al. (151). The list of individual fungi is provided in the legend of Fig. 8. The numbers of putative catalases and P450s (secreted and cytosolic) were
obtained
from the MycoCosm online database (258). For each species, the total number of genes corresponding to each enzyme category was calculated, and

Laccases. Alongwithperoxidases(discussedbelow),laccasesaremajorcontributors
of ligninolysis in white-rot fungi ( 156,157). Also known as benzenediol:O2oxidoreduc-
tases (EC 1.10.3.2; AA1 CAZy family) belonging to the multicopper oxidase superfamily
(73), they use O2as a cosubstrate and can directly oxidize a wide range of phenolic
substrates (156). The resulting reduced form of the laccase catalyzes the reduction of
O2to H2O(158) while the oxidized (poly)phenols get involved in depolymerization,
cross-linking,
or internal reactions such as ring cleavage or quinone formation. The
reduction potential of laccases, ca. /H110010.8 V (compared to /H11022/H110011 V for lignin-active
peroxidases), does not allow activity on nonphenolic moieties (E0/H11022/H110011.3 V). This
limitation is overcome by the so-called laccase-mediator systems ( 159,160). In short,
the
mediator (e.g., a phytophenolic) is oxidized by the laccase and acts as an electron
shuttle by diffusing out of the laccase active site to further oxidize substrates, such asnonphenolic lignin subunits, otherwise not directly tractable by the laccase itself ( 161).
The 
interplay between laccases and LPMOs is not clear yet. It is clear that soluble lignin
fragments emerging from laccase action, which still contain phenolic groups andreducing power, can activate AA9 LPMOs ( 86,162). Under certain conditions, the
competition 
of laccases for oxygen may be relevant.
Lignin-active peroxidases. Peroxidasesaresofartheonlyknowntypeofligninolytic
enzymesrelyingontheuseofH2O2.Peroxidasesbelongtofourindependentlyevolved
superfamilies (163), spanning all kingdoms of life. The largest family, the peroxidase-
catalase
superfamily, contains three families (called families I to III) ( 163) (PeroxiBase
database
[peroxibase.toulouse.inra.fr]). Three types of lignin-modifying peroxidases, all
belonging to family II ( 164), have been identiﬁed thus far, namely, the lignin (LiPs),
manganese
(MnPs), and versatile (VPs) peroxidases. All of these enzymes belong to
family AA2 in CAZy.
LiPs, MnPs, and VPs all use H2O2as an oxidant but employ very different strategies
to act on lignin (165). While LiP, with a high redox potential (E0=/H11015/H110011.2 V versus SHE
at pH 3) can directly oxidize nonphenolic aromatic compounds, MnP uses an indirectpathwayrelyingontheoxidationofMn(II)toMn(III),whichisreleasedfromtheenzyme.Mn(III) is then chelated by organic compounds (e.g., oxalate or malate) and can act asa diffusible oxidizing agent on phenolic (but not on nonphenolic) substrates. VP, witha very high redox potential (E
0=/H110221.4 V versus SHE), shows features that are common
toLiPandMnPandcanoxidizebothnonphenolicandphenoliccompounds.Itisworthnoting that despite, or because of, its indirect mode of action, MnP is often the mostabundant lignin-active peroxidase found in white-rot fungal secretomes.
Peroxidases compete with LPMOs for H
2O2and may thus inhibit LPMO activity
under certain conditions, as has been shown by several authors ( 32,44).
A
diversity of enzymatic H2O2producers. In lignocellulolytic systems, H2O2can
be produced by several extracellular enzymes, most of which belong to the GMCoxidoreductase superfamily: cellobiose dehydrogenases (AA3_1; see above); arylalcohol oxidase (AAO) (AA3_2; EC 1.1.3.7) ( 166), glucose oxidase (GOX) (AA3_2; EC
1.1.3.4)
(167), methanol oxidase (MOX) (AA3_3; EC 1.1.3.13) ( 168), and pyranose
2-oxidase
(P2O) (AA3_4; EC 1.1.3.10) ( 169). H2O2may also be generated by extra-
cellular copper radical oxidases (CRO), which include glyoxal oxidase (GLOX)(AA5_1; EC 1.2.3.15) ( 170,171) and alcohol oxidase (AlcOx) (AA5_2; EC 1.1.3.13)
(172), and by gluco-oligosaccharide oxidases (GOOX) (AA7, EC 1.1.3. /H11002)(173,174)
(Fig. 8). H
2O2-generating enzymes are widely distributed in both white-rot and
brown-rot fungi (Fig. 7)( 155,175), indicating that H2O2will be generated during
biomass conversion, regardless of the decomposition strategy.
These H2O2-producing enzymes act on many different compounds derived from
lignocellulose (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). MOX, which seemsequally abundant in white- and brown-rot fungi ( 155), oxidizes methanol, which is
a 
product of the demethoxylation of lignin-derived phenolics ( 176) and has been
suggested
to be the main H2O2supplier of Fenton chemistry during brown-rotBissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

decay (177). AAO, one of the most frequent GMC oxidases in white-rot fungi ( 155)
(Fig. 8), is an extracellular enzyme acting preferentially on fungal metabolites such
as
4-methoxylated benzoyl alcohols ( 166). These aromatic alcohols are the products
of
lignin-derived aldehydes or acids that have been reduced by aryl-alcohol dehy-
drogenases (EC 1.1.1.90) and aryl aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.30) ( 178).
GOXs,
whicharestructurallyandsequentiallycloselyrelatedtoAAOandfoundboth
intra- and extracellularly, are not widespread in wood decayers, and their role in
lignocellulolysis is not clear. P2O is found at the hyphal periplasmic space or in thesecretome (putatively upon cell lysis) and has a broader substrate speciﬁcity thanGOX as it can catalyze the oxidation of several aldo-pyranoses at the C-2 position(179,180). Although efﬁcient at reducing O
2, P2O has also been shown to reduce

containing a P2O gene (1 gene). It should be noted that the dichotomy between lignin and (hemi)cellulose-derived substrates is not always clear-cut since
substrates such as veratryl alcohol can be synthesized as a secondary metabolite de novofrom glucose (428).Oxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

quinones and complexed metals (Fig. 4 and Table S1) (181, 182). The involvement of
P2O
in lignocellulose conversion is supported by immunocytochemical and substrate-
dependent gene regulation studies ( 169,183–185).
Vanillyl-alcohol
oxidases (AA4) are intracellular FAD-dependent enzymes that act on
activated aromatic alcohols such as 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohols, leading to the concom-
itant production of H2O2(186,187). As intracellular enzymes, AA4s are not thought to
be
directly involved in lignocellulolysis but in the metabolism of lignin-derived com-
pounds ( 188,189).
GLOX
(AA5_1) is widely distributed among wood decayers. The enzyme acts mainly
on aldehydes that are released during lignin and carbohydrate processing ( 190) and is
considered
to be physiologically coupled to lignin-active peroxidases ( 149,170,175,
190,191).ThesubstratespeciﬁcityoftheAA5familyhasrecentlybeenexpandedbythe
characterization
of two alcohol oxidases (constituting a subclade of AA5_2) active on
aliphatic primary alcohols (e.g., butan-1-ol, benzyl, and cinnamyl alcohol) ( 172). The
authors
ofthestudyspeculatedthattheseAA5_2enzymesmayhavearoleinplantcell
wall depolymerization even though the identity of the natural substrate has not yetbeen determined.
Gluco-oligosaccharideoxidase(GOOX)activitywasreportedmorethan25yearsago
(192). GOOX enzymes, classiﬁed as AA7s, have hitherto received less attention than
other
H2O2suppliers in fungal secretomes. GOOXs are secreted enzymes, sharing some
substrate speciﬁcity with CDH, P2O, and GOX ( 173). They are primarily active on
gluco-oligosaccharides,
but activity on xylo-oligosaccharides has also been described
(174). Very little is known about their biological role. Some researchers have proposed
that
GOOX may fuel lignin-active peroxidases, which is the usual proposal when it
comes to identifying a H2O2sink in lignocellulolytic enzyme systems. Today, LPMOs
provide an alternative H2O2sink. Interestingly, considering the substrate speciﬁcities of
GOOX and LPMOs, the two enzymes could be acting in close proximity, which couldlead to better reaction control. AA7s have been detected together with AA9s in thesecretome of S. commune, a gray-rot fungus, when they colonize artichoke stalk ( 142).
Several
members of the GMC oxidoreductase superfamily have now been shown to
activate LPMOs ( 83,193). As described above (see subsection “The CDH Case: a
Multifunctional
Redox Partner”), CDH is a known redox partner that, by means of its
two-domain structure, plays the dual role of reducing the LPMO and supplying H2O2.
Interestingly, the Cyt domain is not absolutely required for GMC oxidoreductases todrive LPMO reactions as single-domain DHs, such as the glucose dehydrogenase (GDH)or aryl-alcohol quinone oxidoreductases (AAQO) (subfamily AA3_2), can also drive AA9LPMO activity ( 193). On the other hand, single-domain strict oxidases such as the GOX
or
AAO are not able to reduce or activate the LPMO ( 32,193). The way in which GDH
or
AAQO reduces the LPMO remains unclear and may involve mediators, such as
superoxide or cofactors. Interestingly, some fungal secretomes contain many H2O2-
generating oxidases as well as LPMOs while lacking both CDH and any usual H2O2
consumer (e.g., peroxidase) ( 83,143). In light of the recent insights into LPMO func-
tionality,
theseoxidasescanbeviewedasH2O2-generatingpartnersofLPMOsalthough
theymaybefulﬁllingotherrolesthatremaintobediscovered.Inthisrespect,itisworthnoting that knocking out cdhgenes in Podospora anserina did not alter its growth on
lignocellulose but led to increased production of (H
2O2-generating) ﬂavo-oxidases
(AA3_2)andCRO(AA5_1)alongwith /H9252-glucosidases(111).ItispossiblethatLPMOsare
reduced
by other factors, such as redox mediators, and that the oxidases then fuel the
reaction by delivering H2O2. Indeed, it has been shown that glucose oxidases, which
alone cannot drive LPMO reaction, do so very well upon reduction of the LPMO by areductant ( 32). Notably, the natural environment of wood-decaying fungi is rich in
phenolic 
compounds, which can reduce LPMOs ( 83).
As
shown in Fig. 4,H2O2-producing oxidases (AA3_2, _3, _4, AA4, AA5, and AA7)
display, in general, catalytic constants spanning two orders of magnitude, from 10 to300 s
/H110021, approximately (see Table S1 in the supplemental material for details). On the
other hand, the H2O2-producing ability of CDH is much lower and lies in the range ofBissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

10/H110022to 10/H110021s/H110021. LPMOs present the lowest capacity to reduce O2into H2O2, with
reported catalytic rates ranging between 10/H110024and 10/H110022s/H110021.
Whether the relatively low H2O2production rate displayed by CDH would be a way
to control LPMO action during white-rot decay is an interesting possibility. The neces-
sity of a match between H2O2production and H2O2consumption in lignocellulolytic
enzyme systems has been argued in the past by Philip Kersten, who noticed that theH
2O2generator GLOX drives the lignin peroxidase action and that the much higher
catalytic efﬁciency of GLOX (than that of the peroxidase) may explain why it is yet aminor component of the lignocellulolytic broth ( 170). It is also worth noting that H
2O2
hasbeenproposedasalimitingfactorinlignocellulolysisby P. chrysosporium (194,195)
or
limiting the action of MnP during compost lignin conversion by Agaricus bisporus
(196). Overall, it is tempting to think that, in order to match and control H2O2ﬂuxes
between emitters and receptors, nature has coevolved catalytic efﬁciencies and en-zyme secretion levels. However, such correlations remain to be clearly demonstrated.
The housekeeping role of catalases. As highlighted above, H
2O2appears to be a
central molecule produced and used by several enzymatic systems involved in ligno-cellulolysis.H
2O2isper searatherstablemolecule(197)butcanbedestabilized.Indeed,
in
a complex environment, such as biomass-decomposing litter, free reduced metals
are likely to be found, and these may react with H2O2, leading to the generation of
hydroxyl radicals by Fenton chemistry. Beyond metal-catalyzed reduction of H2O2,
directreductionbyreductantsisalsoapossibility( Fig.3)althoughitwilloccuratmuch
lower
rates. For instance, the second-order rate constant for the reaction of H2O2with
the strong reductant ascorbate is only 1.03 M/H110021·s/H110021at pH 7.0 (198).
The
generation of hydroxyl radicals and other ROS exposes the system’s com-
ponents to irreversible and destructive oxidative damage. Housekeeping enzymaticactivities referred to as catalase activities have evolved to avoid such damage(199–201). Catalase activity, i.e., the enzymatic disproportionation of H
2O2into O2
and H2O (2H2O2¡2H2O/H11001O2), is found in all kingdoms of life and can be carried
out by three groups of proteins, namely, by typical (also known as monofunctional)catalases(EC1.11.1.6),bysomemembersoftheperoxidase-catalasefamily(EC1.11.1.6/7), and by nonheme manganese catalases (a minor group) (EC 1.11.1.6). Typicalcatalases, which constitute the predominant group ( 199), are heme iron-dependent
enzymes
with high kcat(104to 105s/H110021) but rather poor apparent Kmvalues for H2O2(3
to 103mM range) (200, 201). Similar values apply to the bifunctional peroxidase-
catalases
(103to 104s/H110021and 3.7 to 8 mM for the catalase activity) ( 202). These values
differ
strongly from values for peroxidases, i.e., enzymes that use H2O2as oxidant,
which show lower catalytic rates (10/H110021to 103s/H110021) but also much lower Kmvalues (101
to 103/H9262M) (203–206). Typical catalases display a deeply buried active site, to which
H2O2moleculesgainaccessviaalongchannel,thepropertiesofwhich(shape,size,and
composition) are optimized to increase the ratio of H2O2to H2O and, thus, reactivity
(207,208).Variationsinchannelfeatures,impactinginletandoutletﬂuxes,mayexplain
the
wide range of observed catalytic efﬁciencies ( 199,202).
The
kinetic properties of catalases, with their high, noncompetitive Kmvalues, seem
adapted to keeping the level of H2O2low enough to avoid oxidative damage without
inhibitingH2O2-dependentenzymeswiththeirmuchmorecompetitive Kmvalues.High
catalytic efﬁciencies displayed by catalases may, on the other hand, be related to thenecessity of a fast response in the case of H
2O2accumulation. This scenario would
obviously beneﬁt lignocellulosic redox enzyme systems. It has been shown that cata-lases are secreted simultaneously with H
2O2-consuming enzymes, such as peroxidases,
during the biodegradation of spruce wood by the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete
chrysosporium (209).Thebrown-rotfungus Postia placentasecretescatalasesalongwith
GHs in a later phase of wood degradation, possibly as a means to protect the GHs fromresidual Fenton reagents used in the earlier phases of the brown-rot process ( 146) (see
subsection 
“Enzyme Production during Lignocellulose Depolymerization,” below). The
role of catalases in H2O2regulation may translate into antagonistic effects, as observed
with knockout of catalase genes in Podospora anserina (210,211). Bourdais et al. (210)Oxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

showed that the ﬁve P. anserina catalases play different roles and that there may be a
trade-off between the need for protection and the need for H2O2to increase the
efﬁciency of lignocellulose depolymerization efﬁciency. The multiplicity of catalase
genes in microbial genomes suggests a need for ﬂexibility and underpins a need forfurther research on the roles of these enzymes during biomass conversion.
The dynamic aspect of H
2O2ﬂuxes renders the determination of real H2O2levels
encountered in biological systems rather challenging. Impressively, values reported in
the literature span approximately seven orders of magnitude. Intracellular levels arethought to be extremely low to protect from lethal ROS-induced damage, i.e., in thelow-nanomolar range ( 212,213). Conversely, extracellular levels are higher and may be
bacteriostatic
(micromolar) or even bactericidal (millimolar) ( 214). Some pathogenic
microorganisms,
such as some Streptococcus species (215) or the rice blast fungus
Magnaporthe
oryzae(216), can resist millimolar concentrations of H2O2.I nt h e1t o1 0 0
/H9262M range, effects with different amplitudes can be observed on fungal growth de-
pending on the region considered, with the hyphae being for instance more resistantthan the conidia ( 217–219). Plants can tolerate up to several millimolars of H
2O2(100
/H9262M to 200 mM) (220, 221). Importantly, H2O2produced intracellularly is likely to be
used intracellularly while H2O2produced extracellularly is consumed extracellularly,
suggesting that both systems are partly disjoint. Indeed, it has been shown that H2O2
transmembranetransportin Saccharomyces cerevisiae andbacteriaisverylimited(222),
and
this is consistent with the (potentially) enormous difference in the concentrations
encountered on both sides of the cellular membrane.
It is known that plants trigger a defense mechanism called oxidative burst when
they are under threat ( 223), which implies production of ROS and, notably, H2O2(224,
225). Interestingly, for hitherto unexplained reasons, necrotrophic fungal pathogens
such
asBotrytis cinerea orColletotrichum graminicola takeadvantageofthisresponseto
proliferate ( 226,227). These microorganisms can express multiple LPMOs and peroxi-
dases
(24,228), and one may wonder if the pathogens harness plant-generated H2O2
to fuel their degradative redox enzyme machinery. The ambivalent role of H2O2is also
highlighted by the fact that some plants use catalases as defense against pathogenicfungi such as Aspergillus ﬂavus (229). Another indication for a role of H
2O2and
H2O2-producing enzymes in pathogenicity is provided by two independent studies
showing that Botrytis cinerea became less virulent upon deletion of genes encoding
either superoxide dismutase (SOD) ( 230) or GLOX (231). Membrane-bound GLOX has
also
been implicated in pathogenesis for crop pest Fusarium species (232).
Nonenzymatic
Production and Use of H2O2
In ecological niches where biomass decomposition occurs, several nonenzymatic
reactions can generate or consume H2O2. This additional layer of complexity needs to
be taken into account in order to understand lignocellulose conversion.
Nonenzymatic sources of H2O2.The reduction of O2into H2O2, possibly via
superoxide, O2˙/H11002, as an intermediate (Fig. 3) requires compounds with low enough
reduction
potentials.Manyplant-derivedphenols,alsocalledphytophenolics,havethis
capacity and are abundant in decomposing matter ( 233). Phenolics are also known
metabolites
of brown-rot fungi (234), and it has been shown that the activity of some
microbial
extracellular enzymes is modulated by these compounds ( 235). Like many
reducing
agentswithantioxidantproperties,phenolicscanalsoactasprooxidants,e.g.,
by reducing transition metals that subsequently engage in damaging oxidative pro-cesses such as Fenton chemistry ( 236). What happens in a biological system depends
on 
theconcentrationofthechemicalsinquestion,thepresenceoftransitionmetals(Fe
and Cu) and of O2, and the reduction potentials of the derived radical(s). Phytophe-
nolicshavedifferentstructures,whichaffecttheiranti-andprooxidantproperties( 237).
Importantly,
the H2O2production potential of phenolics is also pH dependent ( 238). As
outlined
herein, several phytophenolics promote LPMO activity with different efﬁcien-
cies (65,83), and one may question if their role is only to reduce the copper site or alsoBissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

to provide H2O2. The role of phytophenolics during lignocellulolysis remains rather
unclear, but their potential importance is well documented.
Fenton-type chemistry: a sink for H2O2.Regarding nonenzymatic H2O2sinks, the
chelator-mediated Fenton (CMF) reaction ( 6,239), notably used by brown-rot and
certain
LiP-deﬁcient white-rot fungi, is considered central. Fenton reactions, i.e., the
reaction of H2O2with a reduced transition metal, generate hydroxyl radicals, which are
thought to be involved in an initial, nonenzymatic pretreatment of lignocellulose. The
CMFsystemﬁndsbiologicalrelevancewhenoneconsidersthatenzymesareusuallytoobig(20to100Åindiameterassumingaglobularshape[ 240])topenetratewoodpores
(10 
to 40 Å in diameter; up to 100 Å in some cases [239, 241,242]). On the other hand,
such
achemicalstrategyisratherdangerousforthemicroorganism,and,therefore,the
hydroxyl radicals have to be generated at a safe distance. Due to the diffusion-limitedand nonspeciﬁc character of their reactivity, with a half-life of nanoseconds ( 239),
hydroxyl 
radicals have to be generated in situ, i.e., in wood pores, to be both efﬁcient
and not harmful for the fungus. To perform such spatial control, it has been proposedthat the pH dependency of metal reduction and concentration gradients of metalchelators such as oxalic acid or 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) play a major role(243), as has been reviewed elsewhere ( 234).
In
the gradient scenario, low pH (/H110152) and a high concentration of oxalate (a fungal
metabolite) at close proximity of the fungal hyphae keep Fe(III) in a stable chelatedform that can diffuse into wood pores. Once within the wood, the combined effect ofhigher pH (/H110155.5 to 6) and lower oxalate concentration leads to release of Fe(III), whichcan then be reduced to Fe(II) by wood-penetrating redox compounds such as catecholor hydroxamic acids ( 244), oxalate (245), or, potentially, by low-molecular-weight
peptides
(234,246). Redox cycling involving low-molecular-weight metabolites such as
hydroquinones
(247) or involutin (248) has also been proposed to be involved in iron
reduction.
The reduced transition metal can then react with H2O2(249,250) via the
well-known
Fenton reaction reported in 1894 ( 251), which produces a hydroxyl radical
and
a hydroxide ion (Fig. 6). CDH has often been linked to Fenton chemistry, both as
a
producer of H2O2and because of its ability to reduce iron (112–116); such a role,
however,
seems questionable because CDH likely cannot penetrate wood pores. Of
note, superoxide can also play the role of reductant via the Haber-Weiss reaction ( 252).
The
control of H2O2levels, which directly impact the efﬁciency of the CMF reaction,
is a key parameter to consider. In brown-rot fungi the CMF system is thought to befueled with H
2O2by the action of GMC oxidoreductases and/or copper radical oxidases
(155)(seesubsection“TheFunctionofLignocellulolyticOxidoreductases,”above).Little
is
known about the actual H2O2concentrations needed. In vitrostudies of Fenton
reactions often use high (millimolar) H2O2concentrations and time scales that do not
seem compatible with in vivoconditions.
While Fenton chemistry, with its seemingly clear biological relevance, is almost by
default mentioned as an H2O2sink in discussions of fungal biomass-related enzymol-
ogy, it is important to note that the CMF system is just one way of exploiting theoxidativepowerofcombiningH
2O2withareductant.Reactionsbetweenthereductant
and H2O2may take place in many locations, in a controlled or noncontrolled manner,
and be beneﬁcial or detrimental. For example, it has been suggested that suchchemistry occurs in the termite gut, which seemingly lacks LPMOs and peroxidases butcontains many H
2O2-generating and iron-reducing enzymes ( 253). Similarly, Fenton-
type
reactions were shown to occur in the midgut of a leaf-feeding caterpillar ( 254). It

The ﬁrst white-rot fungus genome (from P. chrysosporium) was published in 2004 (256).
Since
the takeoff in fungal genomics in 2009 ( 257), more than 1,000 fungal genomes
have
been hitherto sequenced, mostly under the ﬂag of the 1,000 Fungal Genomes
Project (258) led by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Joint Genome Institute. Lignocel-

conversion involves many players ( Fig. 6andTable 2), and genomes alone are
not
sufﬁcient to elucidate how the orchestra of lignocellulose-active enzymes is regu-
lated in time and space. With the emergence of multi-omics data, the reconstruction ofbiomolecular reaction networks involved in plant biomass decomposition becomes apossibility ( 259,260). Based on accumulating omics data, we brieﬂy discuss below (i)

aThe table summarizes the main enzymatic activities that are thought to be involved in lignocellulose conversion. They have been ordered according to the class of
substrate they act on, namely, lignin, hemicelluloses, pectin or cellulose. For each type of enzyme we provide the most common abbreviation(s) and the CAZy
(sub)family (21). Catalases, cytochrome P450s and other non-CAZymes are not included.
bSee Rytioja et al. (263) for a detailed list of pectin-active CAZymes (GH2, -3, -28, -35, -43, -51, -53, -54, -62, -78, -88, -93 and -105; PL1, -3, -4, -9, and -11; and CE1, -8,
and
-12), which should be updated with several recently discovered pectin-active CAZyme families (GH137 to GH143 [ 427], GH145 [431], and GH146 and GH147
[432]).
cFor historical reasons (evolving terminology and enzyme reclassiﬁcation), several abbreviations may be found for the same activity. Early names are often kept byhabit but also for optimal tracking of the literature. A more standardized approach consists in using the CAZy (sub)family preceded by initials, in italics, of themicroorganism of origin. For example, SmAA10A would be the ﬁrst characterized AA10 from Serratia marcescens (historically known as CBP21). Alternatively, the two-
letter code indicating the CAZy class maybe replaced by a three- or four-letter abbreviation that indicates what the enzyme does. For example, the GH5 familycontains both cellulases and mannanases; hence, one may ﬁnd TrCel5A and TrMan5A, which indicate a GH5 endo-cellulase and a GH5 endo-mannanase from
Trichoderma reesei, respectively.

ization of lignin and (hemi)cellulose and (ii) the interplay between Fenton chemistry
and enzymes in brown-rot decay. The regulation and properties of cellulases andhemicellulases have been extensively covered by other investigators in comprehensivereviews ( 261–264).
Insights
from recent multi-omics studies. It is known that some microorganisms
have evolved enzymatic arsenals that are speciﬁcally adapted to a given habitat(265–267) while others have kept a broad array of activities (110, 263,268,269),
ensuring 
adapted responses to diverse environments ( 270). In 2017, a large-scale study
analyzed
22 transcriptomics data sets from 10 species of plant-decaying basidiomyce-
tes displaying a white-, gray-, or brown-rot phenotype ( 271). Among 328 consistently
differentially
expressed genes, the authors could deﬁne a core set of 50 CAZymes
involved in the degradation of plant polysaccharides. Among these, ﬁve enzyme typeswere found upregulated in at least 18 of the data sets:
/H9252-glucosidase, /H9252-xylosidase,
endo-xylanase, endo-mannanase, and /H9251-glucuronidase. This result highlights the point
that enzymatic depolymerization of hemicellulose is common among all fungal types.According to this same meta-analysis, the most prevalent additional common enzymetypes were cellulases, hemicellulases, and pectinases ( 271). Oxidoreductases were not
present
inthesesetsofcommonlyemployedenzymes,andthisislogicalsincedifferent
wood-decaying fungi employ different oxidative strategies ( Fig. 7).
With
this global, but static, enzymatic picture being drawn, we need to consider the
temporalfateofthelignin,hemicellulose,andcellulosefractionsinordertounderstandwhich enzymes may or may not be physiologically linked. Owing to the high recalci-trance of lignin, it has been thought for decades to be the last biopolymer to bedegraded, eventually leading to the production of humic substances. However, weknow today that several scenarios can take place, depending on both the fungus andthe type of substrate. In contrast to most white-rot fungi, which generally (but notalways)carryoutsimultaneousdegradationofligninandcellulose( 110,272–274),fungi
such
asPhanerochaete carnosa (144,145) and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora ﬁrst attack
lignin and then cellulose (275). For instance, when grown on aspen wood, C. subver-
misporaemploys a strategy whereby oxidative lignin-active enzymes are ﬁrst produced
(AAO and MnP) and (hemi)cellulolytic enzymes are secreted later (GH5_5, GH12, andGH45 endoglucanases [EGs], GH6 cellobiohydrolase II [CBHII], GH7 CBHI, EG, GH10xylanase, CE1 acetyl/feruloyl esterase and CE15 glucuronoyl esterases, LPMOs, andCDH) (147). During the ligninolytic phase, genes involved in lipid metabolism (e.g.,
encoding
desaturases) are upregulated along with genes directly involved in lignin
modiﬁcation (MnP) ( 276), in agreement with the hypothesis that a connection exists
between
lipid peroxidation products and oxidation of nonphenolic structures present
in lignin ( 277–279).
When
the white-rot P. chrysosporium is grown on spruce wood, expression of genes
encoding ligninolytic enzymes (MOX and GLOX) is upregulated, whereas cellulasegenes are expressed in a more constitutive manner ( 209). Earlier reports have shown
that 
CDH expression is also induced early, particularly by products of cellulase action
(280). In a recent comprehensive study, Miyauchi et al. used an integrative omics
approach
to show that the saprophytic white-rot fungus Pycnoporus coccineus simul-
taneously secretes GHs, esterases, and oxidoreductases when grown on various ligno-cellulosic substrates ( 148). In this study, peroxidases (AA2), CDH (AA3_1-AA8), AAO
(AA3_2), 
GLOX (AA5_1), and LPMOs (AA9) were highly upregulated, highlighting that
H2O2-dependent peroxidases, H2O2-producing enzymes, and LPMOs cooccur during
lignocellulose breakdown.
Studies of the transcriptomes of Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei, which are
used in the industry for the production of enzymatic cocktails, during growth onsteam-exploded sugarcane bagasse revealed large temporal differences between thetwofungiandshowedtheimportanceofredoxenzymesinboth( 281). A.
niger showed
fast upregulation of CAZyme genes and a relatively early decay in expression levels,whereas the situation was the opposite for T. reesei. A total of 53% and 39%, respec-
tively, of all AA-encoding genes were induced by the biomass for A. nigerand T. reeseiOxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

(out of a total of 68 and 33, respectively). Several extracellular H2O2-generating en-
zymes (AA3_2 and AA3_3) were highly upregulated in both fungi, as well as several
AA9s, highlighting the importance of these enzymes. Interestingly, next to catalasesand glutathione S-transferases, with putative housekeeping functions, and AA9 LPMOs,
only a single known H
2O2-consuming enzyme, a putative peroxidase, was transcribed.
Of note, the T. reesei genome does not contain any cdhgene whereas the A. niger
genome contains only one that was not induced ( 281).
The
results of comparative studies of the secretome of the white-rot fungus Di-
chomitus squalens grown on woody (aspen and spruce) and nonwoody (wheat bran
and cotton seed hulls) biomasses further support the notion that one main role ofH
2O2-generatingenzymescouldbetofuelotherenzymes(LPMOs)thanperoxidases.In
this study, H2O2-consuming peroxidases were expressed at much lower levels on
nonwoody (lignin-poor) substrates whereas the secretome pattern of H2O2-supplying
enzymes(AA3_3andAA5_1)wasnotaffectedbythenatureofthesubstrate( 270).AA9
LPMOs
were secreted on all substrates, and their expression patterns were found to
cluster with different sets of CAZymes, suggesting that LPMOs target different struc-tures.
Several other enzymes or proteins with putative roles in biomass conversion appear
in studied secretomes and transcriptomes. One example is the family of expansins,which, by changing the cell wall structure through a hitherto unknown mechanism,may affect the wall’s susceptibility to enzymatic degradation ( 282,283). Another class
of
enzymes worth mentioning are the P450 monooxygenases, which are abundant and
largely nonsecreted but have been detected in the secretomes of white-rot fungi ( 110,
152,175,276,284) and in the hyphal front of brown-rot fungi (146). P450s are
ubiquitous
heme enzymes, catalyzing a wide range of redox reactions, and their
potential role in biomass conversion remains obscure. Most interestingly, in 2018,Reisky et al. described P450s catalyzing the oxidative demethylation of carbohydratespresent in algal polysaccharides, likely decreasing the recalcitrance of this marinebiomass ( 285). A role of P450s in lignocellulose conversion is plausible since they are
more
abundantinwood-decayingbasidiomycetesthaninnon-wood-decayingrelatives
(286).
How
do brown-rot fungi deal with ROS? The simultaneous use of potentially
harmful ROS (generated in the Fenton reaction) and enzymes by brown-rot fungi isintriguing. As discussed herein, the feasibility of this system is usually ascribed to aspatial partition between the generation of nonselective ROS and GHs (see subsection“Nonenzymatic Production and Use of H
2O2,” above). Recent studies suggest that the
brown-rot fungi Postia placenta, Serpula lacrymans, and Gloeophyllum trabeum (also)
use separation in time ( 146,287). Expression data indicate that these fungi use a
two-step
mechanism where oxidative and hydrolytic actions are temporally separated
by differential gene expression ( 146). Zhang et al. showed that oxidative processes (i.e.,
H2O2and Fe2/H11001-generating enzymatic systems) involved in Fenton reactions are ﬁrst
triggeredatthehyphalfront,constitutingthusasortofpretreatment,whichisfollowedby expression of (hemi)cellulases at a later stage. It is worth noting that expansins andpectinases (GH28) were also expressed during this early phase, in agreement with theirpotential action in initial loosening of the plant cell wall. Importantly, AAO andsuperoxide dismutase, which are H
2O2suppliers, were also expressed during the later
stage of the process along with hydrolytic enzymes. The authors of this study notedthat H
2O2produced by AAO must be directed toward a pathway that remains to be
identiﬁed (the usual recipients, lignin peroxidases, are absent in brown rots). Interest-ingly, a single AA9 LPMO was also expressed during the later stage of biodegradation,and this enzyme may use the AAO-generated H
2O2.
In general, the simultaneous secretion of enzymes with complementary (H2O2
producers versus H2O2consumers) or competitive (different H2O2consumers) impacts
on H2O2ﬂuxes highlights that fungi possess regulatory systems and/or have evolved
well-balanced enzymatic arsenals that allow the maximizing of enzyme efﬁciency whileminimizing inhibition or oxidative damage. One particularly intriguing question isBissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

whether fungi have systems for generating proximity between redox partners. For
example,proximitybetweenthesitesofproductionandconsumptionofH2O2couldbe
one way to minimize damage caused by side reactions involving free H2O2. This is
discussed further below.
On abundance and importance. When omics data are assessed, an important point
of discussion concerns the implications of the numbers. Why are there so many LPMO-and GMC oxidoreductase-encoding genes? Why are there so few CDH genes? Why arethere so few catalase genes? These questions underpin the complexity of analyzinggenomic, transcriptomics, or secretomics data since the number of genes and proteinsdoes not necessarily reﬂect their importance. While abundance is likely a sign ofimportance,importanceisnotnecessarilyreﬂectedinabundance.Thisiswhyquantities(of genes, of transcripts, and of secreted proteins) may need to be weighted by thecatalytic efﬁciency of a given biocatalyst, something that is rarely done.
The abundance of LPMO genes may reﬂect the need to face several different
recalcitrant structures on copolymeric plant cell walls ( 288,289), as beautifully illus-
trated
by the recent discovery of an LPMO that speciﬁcally acts on copolymeric
cellulose-xylan structures ( 25). On the other hand, white-rot fungi harbor only a single,
but
conserved,CDHgene.WhileitcouldbeenvisionedthatasingleCDHenzymecould
serve as a common reductant and H2O2generator for any kind of LPMOs, the question
of proximity between these two enzymes with potentially different targets is morecumbersome. The diversity of H
2O2-generating enzymes, beyond CDH, may reﬂect a
need to produce this central ROS at different speciﬁc locations during plant materialdecomposition.
IMPLEMENTATION OF REDOX STRATEGIES INTO BIOREFINING PROCESSES
The ﬁrst two sections of this review highlighted the observation that oxidative
processes
form an essential part of biomass degradation in nature. In this section, we
will illustrate how bioreﬁning processes can leverage our current knowledge on theseoxidative processes. Microorganisms do achieve complete biomass conversion, butthese biological processes occur on relatively long timescales (weeks and months) dueto physiological and environmental constraints. From a biotechnological standpoint,one of the main challenges consists of not only mimicking but also speeding up themicrobial strategies at reasonable cost ( 290). Here, we provide a nonexhaustive over-
view
of the (possible) impact of the most recent advances in our understanding of the
role of LPMOs and other oxidoreductases on industrial biomass conversion. We discussoxidative pretreatments of biomass, consider the composition of lignocellulolytic en-zyme cocktails and the contribution of oxidoreductases, and end by addressing theimplementation in bioprocess design.
Oxidative Pretreatments
In the lignocellulose-based bioreﬁnery concept, the biomass is ﬁrst rendered more
accessible to enzymes by pretreatment methods ( 291,292) and then enzymatically
depolymerized
to platform molecules (e.g., mono- and oligosaccharides) ( 293), which
can,
in turn, be converted into value-added products by microorganisms. As several
comprehensive reviews on pretreatment technologies are available, here we ad-
dress only pretreatment methods utilizing oxidative processes. Pretreatment tech-nologies using oxidative processes can be classiﬁed into biological ( 294), biochem-
ical, 
and (physico)chemical processes: biological pretreatment methods use a
biomass-degrading microorganism ( 295), biochemical pretreatment methods use
oxidative
enzymes, and (physico)chemical pretreatment methods utilize oxidizing
agents for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Biological pretreatment. The most common biological pretreatments include treat-
ing the biomass with lignin-degrading bacteria, white-rot fungi, or brown-rot fungi(294). Such treatments primarily target lignin, which is generally considered the most
important
hindrance for efﬁcient depolymerization of the polysaccharides. One prom-
ising strategy is the use of microbes that can depolymerize lignin and take up theOxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews
December 2018 Volume 82 Issue 4 e00029-18 mmbr.asm.org 29 on October 4, 2019 by guest http://mmbr.asm.org/ Downloaded from 
resulting products, thus acting as microbial sinks. Uptake of lignin-derived compounds
prevents repolymerization reactions and thereby improves overall biomass deligniﬁca-tion (296, 297). Some white-rot fungal species preferentially target lignin during the
onset 
of biomass conversion, which renders them a suitable choice for selective
biological deligniﬁcation. For instance, pretreatment (during 18 days) of several bio-mass feedstocks by Ceriporiopsis subvermispora resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in
sacchariﬁcation efﬁciency compared to the level with untreated raw material ( 298).
Similarly, 
pretreatment of bamboo culms with the white-rot basidiomycete Punctularia
sp. improved the subsequent enzymatic release of total sugars by 60% ( 299). A very
recent
study showed impressive improvements in cellulose hydrolysis yields from corn
stover when it was pretreated (for 28 days) with the white-rot fungus Physisporinus
vitreus: sacchariﬁcation of the pretreated material with a commercial cellulase cocktailfrom Trichorderma longibrachiatum gave an overall hydrolysis yield of cellulose of 92%,
in contrast to 26% without pretreatment. The extent of the beneﬁcial effect wasproportional to the duration of the pretreatment, and the obtained maximum yieldswere similar to what could be obtained after thermochemical pretreatment ( 300). In
order
to reduce long biological pretreatment times, often associated with sugar loss,
Brethauer et al. proposed an alternative approach that consists of simultaneous sac-chariﬁcation and fermentation combined with in situpretreatment by a white-rot
fungus (Irpex lacteus)( 301).
Biochemical 
pretreatment. While biological pretreatment has produced some suc-
cess,itusuallyrequireslongincubationtimes(ca.20to90days)and,dependingonthespecies used, reduces overall yields through sugar consumption by the microorganism(294). Sugar yield loss may be circumvented by using biochemical approaches inspired
by
the oxidative strategies employed by these organisms. Lignin-active enzymes, such
asperoxidasesandoxidases,fromwhite-rotfungimaybeusedtogeneratefreeradicalsthat nonspeciﬁcally attack lignin. For instance, Asgher et al. have shown that pretreat-ment of sugarcane bagasse with a secretome from Pleurotus ostreatus led to sacchar-
iﬁcation yields (ca. 70% glucose yields) similar to those of chemical pretreatment with4% NaOH ( 302). In principle, enzymatic deligniﬁcation is advantageous because one
uses
mild conditions that require low energy input and may give high yields. However,
so far, this approach still suffers from long reaction times (several weeks) compared to
those with classical physico-chemical treatments ( 303). The cost of the enzymes and
their
cofactors is also a limiting factor.
Mimicking brown-rot fungi by using Fenton ( 304) and chelator-mediated Fenton
(CMF)
(243) treatments to generate lignin-destroying hydroxyl radicals from H2O2close
to the biomass is an attractive scenario ( 305). Indeed, Fenton-type reactions have been
successfully
used to pretreat cotton ﬁbers (306), garden biomass (307), rice straw (308),
steam-exploded
poplar (309), Miscanthus (310), switchgrass (310), corn stover (310), or
wheat
straw (310), allowing up to 5-fold improvements in sacchariﬁcation yields ( 310).
However,
these Fenton reaction-based treatments require large amounts of chemicals
(typically in the 0.1 to 10 M range for H2O2) and may lead to considerable mass loss,
while special care must be taken to ensure innocuousness of the reaction mixture priorto proceeding with downstream steps.
(Physico)chemical oxidative pretreatment. In addition to biological and biochem-
ical pretreatment strategies that are inspired by natural processes, some known (phys-ico)chemical pretreatment methods employ reactive oxygen species. The most com-mon of these methods are ozonolysis (using ozone at ambient temperature andpressure for lignin removal) and wet oxidation (using air/oxygen with water or H
2O2at
elevated temperatures for lignin and hemicellulose removal) ( 291). Although these
methods
are time-efﬁcient and give good subsequent sacchariﬁcation yields, they
require high energy input (e.g., high pressure and temperature) and/or harsh condi-tions (e.g., high concentrations of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and acid) andusually lead to the generation of inhibitory compounds.

Design of Enzymatic Cocktails: the Effect of Oxidoreductases
Although the costs of enzymes used for lignocellulose sacchariﬁcation have de-
creased nearly 20-fold during the past two decades ( 41), enzymes are still a major cost
factor
in bioreﬁning (311–313), especially for the more recalcitrant of substrates. Today,
the
most common commercial products for sacchariﬁcation are enzyme cocktails
produced by heavily modiﬁed versions of the ﬁlamentous ascomycetes Trichoderma
reesei(also known as Hypocrea jecorina)( 314), Aspergillus niger, and Myceliophthora
thermophila. In recent years, it has become more apparent that enzyme mixtures need
to be customized for each target substrate (depending on the biomass type and thepretreatment method it has been subjected to), just as in nature (see Insights into theNetwork of Lignocellulolytic Redox Reactions, above).
Enzymes may be produced on site ( 312) or purchased from commercial enzyme
producers
(315,316). In this respect, one has to keep in mind that the composition of
hitherto
available commercial enzyme blends has been optimized under conditions
which may be suboptimal for the given application. As an example, Novozymeslaunched a hemicellulase preparation (Cellic HTec series) to complement their com-mercial cellulase preparation (Cellic CTec series) to be used on substrates rich in xylan.
In the past years, the rise in awareness of the key role played by oxidative enzymes
in biomass conversion has prompted industrialists and scholars to investigate theirsynergy with canonical (hemi)cellulases. In the following paragraphs, we review thereported effects of LPMOs, lignin-active oxidoreductases, detoxifying enzymes, andCDHs on the conversion of industrially relevant biomasses.
The effect of LPMOs. The performance of cellulolytic enzyme cocktails produced by
Novozymesexperienceda10-foldimprovementbetween2000and2012,whichinpartis due to the inclusion of LPMOs ( 41,317). The effect of LPMOs on the efﬁciency of
cellulolytic
cocktails has been assessed in several studies. In an early study, before the
oxidativenatureofLPMOactivitywasdescribed,Harrisetal.haddemonstratedthatthesecretome of an engineered T. reeseistrain expressing the GH61A from Thermoascus
aurantiacus (today known as TaAA9A) reduced the enzyme loading needed to reach
90% conversion of pretreated corn stover 2-fold compared to the level with a naturalT. reeseisecretome ( 19). Also, a relative increase of 30% in hydrolysis yield (from 69%
to
89%) was measured. Interestingly, this positive effect was not observed on pure
cellulose(19),which,withhindsight,canbeexplainedbythelackofreducingpowerto
drive
the LPMO reaction (in pretreated corn stover lignin fulﬁlls this role). The results
obtained by Harris et al. were similar to the results obtained with CBP21 in 2005, when
LPMO activity was ﬁrst observed in studies of a chitinolytic enzyme system ( 10,318).
Subsequent
to the discovery of the LPMO activity, including the need for reducing
power and oxygen (11), several studies assessed the effects of supplementing enzyme
cocktails
with LPMOs. In an early study, Cannella et al. noted a 25% difference in the
sacchariﬁcationefﬁciencyofpretreatedwheatstrawinacomparisonofLPMO-deﬁcientCelluclastandLPMO-containingCellicCTec2( 84).In2014,Huetal.showedthatspiking
of 
Celluclast with TaAA9A increased hydrolysis yields for corn stover, poplar, or lodge-
pole pine by up to 25%, depending on the pretreatment method employed ( 319). In
2015,
Müller et al. showed that supplementation of a mixture of Celluclast and
Novozym 188 (a /H9252-glucosidase) with TaAA9A improved glucose yields by up to 32%
(i.e., from 64% to 85% of maximum theoretical yield) for steam-exploded birchwood(320), whereas a similar study later showed a 22% relative increase (from 63% to 77%)
for
sulﬁte-pulped Norway spruce ( 321). Importantly, these beneﬁcial effects were not
observed
under anaerobic conditions or in the absence of sufﬁcient reducing power
(320,321). In 2016, Scott et al. also showed the beneﬁcial effect of TaAA9A addition to
a mixture of Celluclast and /H9252-glucosidase on the conversion of steam-exploded wheat
straw, leading to a 43% relative increase in sacchariﬁcation yield (from 39% to 56%)(322). Another study has shown that addition of an AA9 from Penicillium

most
recent discoveries on LPMOs that, among other things, show that activated
LPMOs must bind to substrate in order to avoid self-destructive off-pathway processes(32,34,44). From our own unpublished work, we have strong indications that, due to
unfavorable 
process conditions, only a fraction of the LPMOs in commercial cellulase
cocktails is actually used, whereas a large fraction is subject to oxidative self-inactivation (see below).
Although the beneﬁcial effect of hemicellulases on biomass conversion has been
studied for decades, the potential synergy between hemicellulases and oxidativeenzymes such as LPMOs is, for obvious reasons, a fairly recent matter of investigation.As alluded to above, LPMO activity on various hemicelluloses (xyloglucan, glucoman-nan, and xylan) has been detected. The impact of these hemicellulolytic activities onbiomass processing and the extent of direct synergies between hemicellulases andhemicellulose-active LPMOs in hemicellulose conversion remain largely unknown.Theseeffectsaredifﬁculttostudybecauseofmultipleenzymeactivitiesandsynergisticeffectsthatarehardtodeconvoluteunlessoneusesanextensiveanalyticaltoolbox(forexample, simple measuring of reducing sugars does not show which reactions areactually happening). Another complication lies in the fact that complex formationbetween cellulose and hemicelluloses may affect the activity of LPMOs on each of thecomponents. For example, the ﬁrst xylan-active LPMO ever described showed thisactivity only for xylan that was grafted onto cellulose ( 49). Studies with mixtures of
phosphoric
acid-swollen cellulose (PASC) and hemicelluloses have shown that hemi-
celluloses restrict enzyme access to the cellulose and that LPMO activity on thesehemicelluloses increases cellulose conversion ( 50,51).
It 
has been shown that coincubation of an LPMO, AA9, from Chaetomium globosum
(CgAA9)withaxylanaseledtoa30%increaseinreducingsugaryieldfromaninsoluble
xylan preparation compared to level with the LPMO-free reference reaction ( 325). The
same
authors also showed that addition of CgAA9 to Celluclast led to a 10% to 20%
increase in solubilized reducing sugar obtained from pretreated rice straw. Anotherrecent study showed that a mixture of a xylanase (GH10A) and an LPMO (AA9A) fromthe fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum (GtGH10A and GtAA9A, respectively) improves the
performance of Celluclast (ﬁnal ratio of Celluclast/ GtGH10A/GtAA9A of 60:20:20, wt/
wt/wt) in the sacchariﬁcation of wheat straw ( 326). Interestingly, the presence of the
GH10
was necessary to unlock the full potential of the AA9. Notably, these interesting
studies remain somewhat inconclusive since LPMO products were not analyzed, and itis thus not clear whether the observed effects are due, at least in part, to oxidativecleavage of xylan.
A potentially major breakthrough came in 2018 when Couturier et al. described the
ﬁrst member of a new LPMO family, AA14 ( 25). This AA14 acts speciﬁcally on copoly-
meric
assemblies of cellulose and xylan, cleaving xylan chains that glue cellulose ﬁbrils
together and likely promoting the dissociation of hemicellulose from cellulose.

The effect of lignin-active oxidoreductases. Lignin constitutes a hurdle for efﬁcient
biomass conversion into fuels and chemicals, and, in spite of recent progress ( 327),
bioreﬁneries
have thus far overcome this issue mainly by using harsh thermochemicalBissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

pretreatments. As discussed above, redox enzymes such as lignin peroxidases (AA2) or
laccases(AA1)couldbepartofoxidativepretreatmentstrategies,andsuchlignin-activeoxidoreductases may be beneﬁcial when added to commercial enzymatic cocktails(328). To the best of our knowledge, the potential of such redox enzymes has not yet
been
harnessed in industrial settings, which is likely due in part to the inherent
complexity of redox enzyme systems, which require cofactors and are subject todamaging off-pathway redox processes.
A few recent studies have addressed the possible contribution of such redox
enzymes at lab scale. Although laccases have been studied for decades (mainly onmodelsubstrates),theireffectonrealbiomassdecompositionisstillpoorlyunderstood.Laccases have been used as a delignifying pretreatment tool ( 329) and/or for decreas-
ing
the toxicity of lignin-derived compounds, which could hamper enzymatic sacchar-
iﬁcation and/or subsequent fermentation steps ( 330–332). Regarding the direct addi-
tion
of laccases into cellulolytic cocktails, Rytioja et al. found a 1.5-fold increase in
reducing sugar yield (from 5.3% to 8%) when a fungal laccase (from M. thermophila)
was added to a mix of cellulases acting on sugar beet pulp while no effect wasobserved on lignin-rich wheat bran ( 333) (Note the low yields, which are due to the
absence 
of pretreatment.) Very recently, Singh et al. studied the effect of a bacterial
laccase (from Amycolatopsis sp. strain 75iv3) on sacchariﬁcation of steam-exploded
poplar by Celluclast and found an 8% increase in cellulose hydrolysis yield (from 61%to 66%), which they ascribed to the lignin depolymerization action of the laccaseand/or to its detoxiﬁcation effect ( 334). On the other hand, Brenelli et al. found that
addition
of laccases from M. thermophila (MtL) or Trametes villosa (TvL) had a negative
effect on the efﬁciency of the LPMO-containing Cellic CTec2 cocktail during conversionof various biomasses, with a 49% decrease in hydrolysis yield on steam-explodedsugarcane bagasse ( 162). Interestingly, the addition of laccases led to considerable
consumption
of O2, which may inhibit LPMO action and may explain the lower glucose
yields. Laccases are indeed relatively efﬁcient O2consumers (Fig. 3; see also Table S1 in
the
supplemental material). It would be interesting to supply laccase-containing reac-
tion mixtures with H2O2, which is a cosubstrate for LPMOs but not for laccases.
All in all, while effects of adding laccases to cellulolytic enzyme cocktails have been
observed, the nature of these effects remains largely unknown. The effects may varyfrom detoxiﬁcation effects to a direct effect on lignin structure.
Lignin peroxidases have mainly been explored as oxidative pretreatment tool (see
subsection “Oxidative Pretreatments,” above). Studies assessing the potential synergybetween peroxidases and cellulolytic cocktails are scarce. A patent from Novozymes(335) describes the beneﬁcial effects of peroxidases that are ascribed to the removal of
excess
H2O2that may induce oxidative damage. In light of current knowledge, this
concept likely needs some revision since peroxidases will compete with LPMOs forH
2O2(32,44). In a rare public report, Salvachúa et al. showed that the addition of a
fungal
peroxidase (DyP from Irpex lacteus) to a cellulase cocktail (Celluclast comple-
mented with commercial /H9252-glucosidase, /H9252-xylosidase, and xylanases) improved sac-
chariﬁcation of wheat straw to an extent (between 16% and 41% relative increase) thatwas dependent on whether the biomass had undergone biological pretreatmentand/or alkali washing ( 336). Another study showed that combining a commercial
cellulase
cocktail from T. longibrachiatum with the versatile peroxidase from P. vitreus,
supplemented with a glucose oxidase as H2O2generator, led to a 14% increase in the
yield of released glucose from raw corn stover (from 85% to 97%) ( 300). In light of
recent
ﬁndings on LPMOs, this effect could also be due to promotion of LPMO activity
by the generated H2O2.
The effect of prooxidant, antioxidant, and detoxifying enzymes. Prooxidant,
antioxidant, and detoxifying (PAD) enzymes include SOD, catalase, and aldo-ketoreductase (AKR). These enzymes are thought to be involved in securing the stability ofredox systems and, in some cases, in converting potential lignin-derived inhibitorycompounds. The (potential) roles of these enzymes in biomass processing are intrigu-ing and complex and have not yet been investigated in sufﬁcient depth.Oxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews
December 2018 Volume 82 Issue 4 e00029-18 mmbr.asm.org 33 on October 4, 2019 by guest http://mmbr.asm.org/ Downloaded from 
A study published in 2017 has addressed the role of an AKR from the termite
Coptotermes gestroi (CgAKR-1) on the conversion efﬁciency of sugarcane bagasse ( 337).
Beyond
a role in the detoxiﬁcation of yeast fermentation inhibitors (e.g., furfural and
5-hydroxymethylfurfural [HMF]), it was shown that supplementation of Celluclast
with CgAKR-1 led to a 33% increase (after 24 h) in reducing sugar yields during
sacchariﬁcation of phosphoric acid-pretreated sugarcane bagasse. Interestingly,CgAKR-1 catalyzed the NADPH-dependent reduction of O
2to H2O2, and the im-
provement in sacchariﬁcation was correlated with H2O2generation. The authors of
this study proposed that H2O2was involved in oxidation of the lignin fraction,
which could improve substrate access for cellulolytic enzymes ( 337). An effect on
LPMO
activity could also be envisaged although LPMO concentrations in Celluclast
are low ( 320).
Scott
et al. have demonstrated that the addition of a catalase to the Cellic CTec3
cocktail decreases the rate of enzyme inactivation during conversion of pretreatedwheat straw with, however, only modest effects (ca. 10% relative increase) on ﬁnalglucose yields ( 322). They found a larger catalase effect when working with a cocktail
of
Celluclast (80%), TaAA9A (10%), and /H9252-glucosidase (10%); in this case, catalase
addition increased the ﬁnal glucose yield from ca. 56% to 68% of the theoreticalmaximum (i.e., a 20% relative increase) ( 322). Based on these and additional observa-
tions 
for reaction mixtures with added H2O2, the authors proposed that the catalase
protects the cellulolytic enzymes from getting inactivated by H2O2-derived species
(e.g., hydroxyl radicals). H2O2was proposed to originate from biotic and abiotic
reactions, and its production/accumulation was proposed to depend on parameterssuch as O
2availability, temperature, pH, dry matter, and metal content (for further
discussion, see below and “The housekeeping role of catalases,” above). Of note, sucha beneﬁcial effect of catalase addition had been observed as early as 1992 in a studyof the synergism between P. chrysosporium CDH (PcCDH) and a cellulase mixture ( 338).
In
this study, the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of CDH, attributed to high
H2O2production rates leading to oxidative inactivation of cellulases, were alleviated by
the addition of a catalase, which led to a 25% increase in the hydrolysis yield ofmicrocrystalline cellulose.
Superoxide dismutases (SODs) have received massive attention in the past decades
since they convert superoxide, which is toxic for cells, to H
2O2that is further reduced
by H2O2-scavenging enzymes. SODs have been implemented in many health- and
cosmetics-related applications ( 339) but have not made a breakthrough in the ﬁeld of
biomass
conversion. However, a few patents ( 340,341) mention the use of SOD in
enzymatic
mixtures for biomass conversion. Although SODs are usually intracellular
enzymes, Rashid et al. have recently reported the existence of two extracellular SODsfrom the bacterium Sphingobacterium sp. strain T2 that displays ligninolytic activity
(342). The mode of action of these SODs is not established, but the authors proposed
that
the enzymes may be involved in the generation of hydroxyl radicals acting as
lignin oxidants. The role of SOD is complex because the enzyme removes one ROSspecies,superoxide,whilegeneratinganother,hydrogenperoxide.Asalludedtoabove,H
2O2can engage in a wide variety of reactions, varying from beneﬁcial (improved
LPMO activity and well-controlled Fenton chemistry) to highly detrimental. Interest-ingly, it has been shown that SOD can be beneﬁcial for AA10 LPMO activity underconditions that generate a constant ﬂux of superoxide, an effect that was ascribed tothe beneﬁcial effect of continuous in situgeneration of H
2O2(33).
The
effect of CDHs. In pre-LPMO times, it was shown that addition of PcCDH to a
mixture of cellulases from Trichoderma viride promoted sacchariﬁcation of microcrys-
talline cellulose ( 338). Nevertheless, the use of CDH to improve industrial lignocellulose
conversion
has so far been little discussed, and the patent literature shows seemingly
conﬂicting results ( 343,344). While an early patent, from 2010, by Sweeney et al.
describes
a negative effect of CDH ( 343), in 2013, Sigoillot et al. claimed that spiking an
enzyme
cocktail from T. reeseiwith a CDH from the fungus Pycnoporus cinnabarinus
would lead to an increase in total sugar release ( 344). In a related publication, Bey et al.Bissaro et al. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews
December 2018 Volume 82 Issue 4 e00029-18 mmbr.asm.org 34 on October 4, 2019 by guest http://mmbr.asm.org/ Downloaded from 
showed that the addition of this CDH to the T. reeseiGC220 enzyme cocktail (Genecor-
Danisco) supplemented with a /H9252-glucosidase (Novozym 188) doubled sugar release
fromwheatstraw( 345).TheauthorssuggestedthatdifferencesinreportedCDHeffects
could
be due to differences between the enzymes, such as the absence or presence of
a CBM (345). With hindsight, variation in the H2O2production ability and the interplay
with H2O2-dependent enzymes present in the enzyme mixture could be seen as
another explanation for the observations since H2O2can represent both a beneﬁcial
and a harmful factor. A recent study showed that addition of a CBM-free CDH from
Volvariella volvacea to a secretome from T. reesei D-86271 leads to a CDH dose-
dependent increase in overall hydrolysis yield for both ﬁlter paper and deligniﬁedwheat straw ( 346).
The 
effect of CBMs. Theefﬁciencyofcarbohydrate-activeenzymesisaffectedbythe
presence of carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) ( 347,348). The substrate afﬁnity
provided
by CBMs brings the catalytic domain into close proximity of the substrate, a
property that may be particularly beneﬁcial in the case of hardly accessible andnondiffusible substrates such as the copolymeric plant cell wall. Of note, it has beenshownthatthestrongsubstratebindingenabledbyCBMsbecomeslessbeneﬁcial,andeven negative, at higher substrate concentrations, which lead to an increased fre-quencyofenzyme-polysaccharideassociationevents( 349,350).Theseobservationsare
particularly
relevant in industrial settings, where high-solid loadings are desirable.
As of August 2018, 83 families of CBMs have been included in the CAZy database,
and LPMOs are appended to several of these (12). While there are many natural LPMOs
without
a CBM, deletion of the CBM from LPMOs with a CBM is deleterious for enzyme
efﬁciency (56, 79,80,351,352), and this deleterious effect may be substrate dependent
(71,80). Today, there are clear indications that, in the absence of substrate, LPMOs
provided
with electrons and their oxygen-containing cosubstrate suffer from autoxi-
dation of key amino acids in their catalytic center ( 32). Substrate afﬁnity provided by
attached
CBMs may postpone or prevent such oxidative self-inactivation.
Interestingly, a recent study of activation of an AA9 LPMO by a pyranose dehydro-
genase (PDH) belonging to the AA12 family ( 353) showed that deletion of the CBM
from
this three-domain CDH analogue (AA8-AA12-CBM1) reduced the overall efﬁciency
of the PDH-LPMO system (354). This relatively preliminary result is potentially of great
importance
because it could reﬂect a proximity effect. The presence of the cellulose-
binding CBM could ensure that reduction of the LPMO and/or production of itscosubstrateH
2O2,bothcatalyzedbythePDH,happenclosetotheLPMOsubstrate,thus
preventing off-pathway reactions in the LPMO.
The effect of GHs. Since LPMO stability is affected by substrate availability, the
interplay between GHs and LPMOs needs attention in the designing of enzymecocktails. GHs could play an indirect role in stabilizing LPMOs by removing obstaclesfromthepolysaccharidesurfaces,includingchainsalreadyoxidizedbyLPMOs,andthusincreasing the available (crystalline) surface area for LPMO binding. Details of theinterplay between GHs and LPMOs remain remarkably unexplored. We predict thatincreasing insights into LPMO functionality, including LPMO stability, will lead toadjustments in the composition of GHs in enzyme cocktails for biomass processing.
The Impact of Oxygen Dependency on Bioprocessing Strategies
As discussed above, LPMOs are major players in the sacchariﬁcation of several
biomasses of industrial relevance. Until recently, LPMO reactions were thought to be
driven by O
2(only), and this O2dependency poses several challenges to industrial
application. Aeration, i.e., dissolution and homogeneous dispersion of oxygen, at anindustrial scale is expensive. Capital and operational costs for aeration are consideredmajor hurdles for the development of large-scale (e.g., 100 to 1,000 m
3) aerobic
fermentation processes (355, 356). As recently underlined by Humbird et al., the
aeration-related
costs are even more critical for low-margin and high-volume produc-
tion commodities such as biofuels ( 357). Furthermore, at an industrial scale, high
substrate
loadings (/H1102210%, wt/wt) are necessary to lower water consumption andOxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

maximize the sugar concentration after sacchariﬁcation, leading to viscous and heter-
ogeneous slurries and increasing the technological challenges and costs associatedwith mixing and aeration ( 358–360). In the case of lignin-poor biomasses, LPMO action
requires 
not only O2but also addition of reducing agents (320, 321), which adds costs.
In
oxygen-drivenprocesses,reductantsneedtobesuppliedinequimolaramounts(two
electrons per LPMO reaction [ 11]). Importantly, the use of O2can lead to the waste of
valuable reducing equivalents via unproductive, and sometimes harmful, oxidativereactions.
The peroxygenase nature of LPMOs may offer a more cost-efﬁcient and process-
friendlyalternativeforLPMOactivationatlargescalesince,inthiscase,thecosubstrateis a pumpable liquid, and stoichiometric amounts of reductant are not needed. Indeed,efﬁcient, H
2O2-fueled sacchariﬁcation with the LPMO-containing cocktail Cellic CTec2
has been demonstrated for Avicel, sulﬁte-pulped Norway spruce, and steam-explodedbirch wood ( 361). Importantly, and well known from work with peroxygenases ( 362),
tight 
regulationofH2O2supplyisrequiredtoavoidsidereactionsthatdepletereducing
power or inactivate the enzymes ( 361). In other words, conditions should be such that
the
concentration of H2O2is kept at a minimum (likely in the low-micromolar range)
(32,34). Indeed, Scott et al. have shown that the batch-wise addition of H2O2to a
sacchariﬁcation reactor, leading to temporarily high H2O2concentrations, has negative
effects on overall process efﬁciency ( 322).
As
an alternative to supplementing external H2O2,H2O2may be generated in situ,
for example, using glucose oxidase ( 32), a widely used enzyme in industry ( 363), or via
electrochemical
or photocatalytic reduction of molecular oxygen ( 88,364). These last
approaches,
however, would not solve the problem of aeration although the demands
for aeration could differ due to different kinetics of the various alternatives.
An important aspect of biomass conversion concerns the main overall strategy
adopted to optimize potential synergies and minimize the effects of inhibiting com-pounds generated during the various processing steps. Two main approaches areusually considered which differ in that the processes of biomass sacchariﬁcation andmicrobialconversionofsugarsintoadded-valueproductsarerunsequentially(separatehydrolysis and fermentation, or SHF) or simultaneously (simultaneous sacchariﬁcationand fermentation, or SSF). So far, SSF approaches have been considered incompatiblewith harnessing the enzymatic power of LPMOs since the fermenting microorganismseither compete for the supplied O
2or require anaerobic conditions ( 365,366). Activa-
tion
of LPMOs with H2O2, at low, nonharmful concentrations, under anaerobic condi-
tions opens up new possibilities for SSF.
While the H2O2-driven sacchariﬁcation of a relatively clean substrate such as Avicel
works well, with seemingly stoichiometric incorporation of the cosubstrate into oxi-dized sugars ( 32,44), the situation becomes more complicated when complex biomass
is 
used. Lignin-containing biomass contains lots of redox-active components that may
engage in reactions with H2O2, as clearly shown in a recent study by Müller et al. (361).
Finally,
one issue for future studies concerns the temporal orchestration of enzyme
additions. Inspired by extensive knowledge of glycoside hydrolases ( 367) and LPMOs
and
by increased knowledge of natural strategies (see Insights into the Network of
LignocellulolyticRedoxReactions,above),theimpactofsimultaneousorsequentialandtimely addition of various enzyme types at different stages of biomass conversion maybe worth (re)investigating. Orchestrating the concert of oxidative and hydrolytic activ-itieswillcertainlybeoneofthefuturechallengesontheroadtowardmoreefﬁcientandsustainable processes of biomass conversion.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The controlled decomposition of biomass in general and of lignocellulose in par-
ticular
involves a wide diversity of enzymatic activities and chemical reactions, which
are probably not all identiﬁed yet and whose interconnections are far from clear. Here,wehavereviewedenzymes,processes,andpossibleinterconnectionswhilefocusingonLPMOs and the potentially central role of hydrogen peroxide. Based on the discoveryBissaro et al.

of the peroxygenase activity of LPMOs ( 32,33) and subsequent supporting studies ( 34,
43,44,74), we have revisited established views on the LPMO paradigm and provided
alternative
H2O2-based interpretations of literature data.
The question as to what extent LPMO activity directly driven by O2is relevant
remainsopen.ItisworthnotingthehistoryofthediscoveryofGHmechanisms.Initially,
GHs were thought to employ one of two main mechanisms ( 368,369), but as research
progressed,
a variety of family-dependent mechanistic features was discovered ( 370–
372). There may be mechanistic variations and not yet discovered alternative mecha-
nisms
within the LPMO superfamily. In the case of GHs, variations in mechanism are
often related to the nature of the target substrate. The same could very well apply toLPMOs, especially since current (limited) data indicate that binding of the two sub-strates (i.e., the polysaccharide and the oxygen-delivering cosubstrate) is interdepen-dent(34,373).Consideringtheimportanceofternarycomplexformationandtheeffect
of
substratebindingontheconﬁnementoftheotherwiseexposedcatalyticcenter( 45),
it
is possible that substrate-dependent variations in the catalytic mechanism occur, as
also recently suggested by Simmons et al. ( 57).
Regardless
of the true mechanism(s) of LPMOs, the efﬁcient use of H2O2by fungal
LPMOs (AA9) is compatible with their ecological context. Above, we have stressed theJanus-type role played by H
2O2in lignocellulose conversion, being a product of
oxidases and of the oxidation of organic compounds, being a substrate of peroxidases,peroxygenases, and catalases or in Fenton-type reactions, but also being a potentiallydamaging entity, primarily through its reaction with transition metals. Several authorshave pointed out the intriguing genomic cooccurrence and coexpression of H
2O2-
generating enzymes (e.g., strict oxidases) along with GHs and LPMOs in the absence ofclassical, known H
2O2sinks. Considering H2O2-driven catalysis by LPMOs, which are
abundantly encoded in genomes and abundantly expressed during growth on bio-mass, the cooccurrence of these enzymes now has a plausible explanation. It appearsreasonable to speculate that, in order to tame ROS, dedicated enzymatic tools haveevolved to deal efﬁciently with the respective chemistries of their reduction, resultingin optimized cooperation between enzymes. While oxidases, often FAD-dependentenzymes, appear equipped to deal with the reduction of O
2, to provide in ﬁneH2O2,
LPMOs are clearly much more efﬁcient in reducing H2O2than in reducing O2directly.
The role of nonenzymatic entities such as phytophenolics in the redox processes
occurring during biomass conversion is undeniable and highly relevant, both biologi-cally and industrially ( 19,83,86,374,375). For example, it is clear that lignin and
fragments 
thereof affect LPMO catalysis. Furthermore, it is obvious that ROS such as
H2O2will react with some of these nonenzymatic redox entities. Finally, the role of
seeminglyuncontrollableFentonchemistryremainsintriguing.Integratingthesechem-ical aspects, which do not appear from omics studies, into our understanding oflignocellulolysis constitutes a considerable future challenge.
Another future challenge concerns the need for more insight into spatial and
temporal aspects. The impacts of simultaneous versus sequential decomposition andthe temporal and spatial regulation of enzyme expression still need more attention(261). Another remaining issue concerns the possible existence of backup mechanisms,
as
illustratedbythestudyofaΔcdh strainof Podospora anserina,whosegrowthwasnot
affected due to the activation of alternative strategies ( 111) (see above for details).
The
remarkable diversity of H2O2-generating enzymes encountered during ligno-
cellulose conversion raises interesting questions. As pointed out above, the widelyaccepted idea that these enzymes are general partners of peroxidases may needrevision. Notably, if general H
2O2production, rather than substrate oxidation, is the
main purpose of these enzymes, why then are there so many different enzymesemployed to generate an identical product? Noting the wide variation in substratespeciﬁcity among these enzymes, which act on a variety of (hemi)cellulose- or lignin-derived compounds, one may wonder if this wide spectrum of H
2O2-producing en-
zymes has evolved to ensure that H2O2is produced only at speciﬁc locations, i.e.,
locations where the oxidase substrate is present and an enzyme such as an LPMO or aOxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews

peroxidaseisreadytousetheproducedH2O2.Suchastrategywouldreducehazardous
bulk production of H2O2and satisfy the need for proximity between redox partners,
minimizing undesired competition between enzymes and off-pathway reactions. Such
proximity effects may be crucial for optimizing enzyme system efﬁciency and may alsobe achieved by appending CBMs to interacting redox partners, as alluded to above(354).
H
2O2is a ubiquitous molecule. It is a relatively stable carrier of reducing equivalents
and of oxygen atoms and is sometimes referred to as a master hormone, notably inplant metabolism ( 220). Compared to atmospheric O
2, which constitutes a hardly
controllable and inﬁnite input in air-exposed environments, H2O2is a liquid compound
offering a much wider concentration range that nature can tightly regulate. This isillustrated by the wide diversity of H
2O2-using enzymes, with catalytic efﬁciencies and
substrate afﬁnities spanning several orders of magnitude. Interestingly, within thecontext of biomass conversion, Robert Blanchette pointed out in 1991 that oxygenconcentrations are extremely low within decaying tree trunks, leading to the sugges-tion that “some mechanism must be operative that delivers necessary oxygen foroxidative reactions involved in lignin degradation” ( 272). In ancient times, before the
Great
Oxidation Event (GOE; controversially dated around 2,450 and 800 million years
ago [376]), H2O2was highly abundant on Earth while O2was not (377). This has led to
the
suggestion that P450 cytochromes were initially peroxygenases and that their
monooxygenase activity evolved later ( 378). LPMOs are ancient enzymes, putatively
already
in use more than 400 million years ago ( 153,379). Given their ability to harness
H2O2, one may wonder if LPMOs were already present in pre-GOE times, and, if so, on
whichsubstratetheywereacting.CytochromeP450suseH2O2onlyathigh(millimolar)
concentrations and with low total turnover numbers, in what is referred to as a shuntreaction that is a putative remainder of ancestral function. In contrast, LPMOs operatein an efﬁcient and stable manner when supplied with low concentrations of H
2O2.
The regulation of the network of lignocellulolytic reactions, involving hydrolases,
oxidoreductases,otherenzymes,andnonenzymaticentities,isessentialforthestabilityand efﬁciency of microbial systems and, thus, for the global carbon cycle. Next to thediscovery and understanding of individual players, there is a clear need to betterunderstandtheirinterconnectioninabiologicalsituation,whicheventuallymayinspirethe design of improved, substrate-adapted industrial processes. We hope that thepresent overview of known and potential players in lignocellulolysis will help intargeting future research in this ﬁeld.

Bastien Bissaro was born in 1988 in the
south of France (Toulouse area). He holds an
M.Sc. degree in biochemical engineering(2011) and a Ph.D. in enzyme engineering(2014) from the National Institute of AppliedSciences (INSA) of Toulouse. In 2014, he ob-tained an AgreenSkills fellowship (Marie Cu-rie action) and funding from the French Na-tional Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA)to study LPMOs in the group of Professor V.Eijsink at the Norwegian University of LifeSciences (NMBU). Dr. Bissaro is currently working at NMBU as a post-doctoral fellow with Dr. Å. K. Røhr aiming at deciphering the LPMOH
2O2reaction mechanism discovered in 2016. Since 2011, his main
scientiﬁc interests have focused on the mechanism, engineering, andevolution of CAZymes related to biomass conversion and valorization.
Anikó Várnai holds an M.Sc. degree in bio-
engineering from the Budapest University ofTechnology and Economics in Hungary(2007) and obtained a Ph.D. degree in bio-technology at the University of Helsinki incollaboration with the VTT Technical Re-search Centre of Finland. After completingher Ph.D. in 2012, she moved to ProfessorVincent Eijsink’s group at the NorwegianUniversity of Life Sciences. Her research in-terest is biomass valorization, with particularfocus on understanding the role various enzyme components play,both individually and in combination with other enzyme components,in nature and in industrial biomass conversion processes and applyingthatknowledgeforprocessoptimizationtomaximizeconversionyields.She has 10/H11001 years of experience in enzymatic biomass conversion with
cellulose- and hemicellulose-active hydrolases, esterases, and redoxenzymes.
Åsmund K. Røhr holds an M.Sc. degree in
physical biochemistry from the University ofOslo (UiO) in Norway (2001). In 2010, heobtained a Ph.D. at the same university,working with in situspectroscopy, protein
crystallography/radiation damage, and com-putational chemistry. This work was contin-ued during a 2012-2014 postdoc period atthe UiO and the European Synchrotron Ra-diation Facility. Between 2008 and 2012, Dr.Røhr also worked as Research Manager forthe company Keep-it Technologies AS located in Oslo, Norway. In 2015,Dr.RøhrestablishedateamattheNorwegianUniversityofLifeSciences(NMBU) in Ås, Norway, where the main focus is directed towardsunderstanding the function and mechanisms of oxidative enzymes inbiomass decomposition.
Vincent G. H. Eijsink holds an M.Sc. degree
from Wageningen University in the Nether-lands (1986). After obtaining a Ph.D. degreeat the University of Groningen, The Nether-lands (1991), and a short postdoc at thesame university working on enzyme stabilityengineering, he moved to the NorwegianUniversityofLifeSciences(NMBU)inÅs,Nor-way, where he became professor in 1997and established an independent researchprogram. The Eijsink group has a primaryfocus on fundamental and applied enzymology related to biomassconversion. Early work mainly concerned the conversion of chitin,whereas today lignocellulosic biomass is central. The group is bestknown for being the ﬁrst to demonstrate the synergistic effects be-tween chitinases and proteins today known as LPMOs, published in2005, and for the discovery of LPMO activity, published in 2010.Oxidoreductases and ROS in Biomass Conversion Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews
