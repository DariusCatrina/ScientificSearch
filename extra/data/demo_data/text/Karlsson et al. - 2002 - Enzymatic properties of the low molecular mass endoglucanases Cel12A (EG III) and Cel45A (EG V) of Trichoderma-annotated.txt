Abstract
Trichoderma reesei produces fi ve known endoglucanases. The most studied are Cel7B (EG I) and Cel5A (EG II)
which are the most abundant of the endoglucanases. We ha ve performed a characterisation of the enzymatic properties
of the less well-studied endoglucanases Cel12A (EG III), Cel45A (EG V) and the catalytic core of Cel45A. For
comparison, Cel5A and Cel7B were included in the study. Adsorption studies on microcrystalline cellulose (A vicel) and
phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) showed that Cel5A, Cel7B, Cel45A and Cel45Acore adsorbed to these
substrates. In contrast, Cel12A adsorbed weakly to both A vicel and PASC. The products formed on A vicel, PASC and
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) were analysed. Cel7B produced glucose and cellobiose from all substrates. Cel5A andCel12A also produced cellotriose, in addition to glucose and cellobiose, on the substrates. Cel45A showed a clearly
different product pattern by ha ving cellotetraose as the main product, with practically no glucose and cellobiose
formation. The kinetic constants were determined on cellotriose, cellotetraose and cellopentaose for the enzymes.Cel12A did not hydrolyse cellotriose. The k
Catvalues for Cel12A on cellotetraose and cellopentaose were significantly
lower compared with Cel5A and Cel7B. Cel7B was the only endoglucanase which rapidly hydrolysed cellotriose.
Cel45Acore did not show acti vity on any of the three studied cello-oligosaccharides. The four endoglucanases’ capacity
to hydrolyse b-glucan and glucomannan were studied. Cel12A hydrolysed b-glucan and glucomannan slightly less
compared with Cel5A and Cel7B. Cel45A was able to hydrolyse glucomannan significantly more compared with b-
glucan. The capability of Cel45A to hydrolyse glucomannan was higher than that obser ved for Cel12A, Cel5A and
Cel7B. The results indicate that Cel45A is a glucomannanase rather than a strict endoglucanase. #2002 Published by

that the annual production of cellulose is 4 /C29 /1010
tonnes ( Coughlan, 1985 ). Cellulose degradation is
thus a very important process. One putati ve
industrial use is to con vert cellulose to glucose
and then ferment the glucose to ethanol ( Duff and
Murray, 1996 ). The ethanol can then be utilised as
fuel for vehicles as a substitute for fossil fuels.
Enzymes which hydrolyse cellulose are pro-
duced by se veral bacteria and fungi ( Be´guin and
Aubert, 1994 ). One of the most studied fungal
cellulase systems is produced by Trichoderma
reesei . The fungus produces a complete set of
cellulases which can hydrolyse cellulose to solublesugars. The cellulases are repressed when glucose ispresent and expressed when the organism star ves
or when certain inducers are present ( Ilme´n, 1997 ).
T. reesei expresses at least two cellobiohydrolases,
Cel6A (CBH II) ( Teeri et al., 1987 ) and Cel7A
(CBH I) ( Shoemaker et al., 1983a; Teeri et al.,
1983 ), (EC 3.2.1.91) and fi ve endoglucanases,
Cel5A (EG II) ( Saloheimo et al., 1988 ), Cel7B
(EG I) ( Penttila ¨et al., 1986 ), Cel12A (EG III)
(Ward et al., 1993; Okada et al., 1998 ), Cel45A
(EG V) ( Saloheimo et al., 1994 ) and Cel61A (EG
IV) ( Saloheimo et al., 1997 ) (EC 3.2.1.4). Here, we
have adopted the nomenclature for classification
of the catalytic domains into families based onsequences ( Henrissat et al., 1998 ). All T. reesei
cellulases, except Cel12A, are modular enzymesand consist of a cellulose binding module (CBM)and a catalytic core domain. Cel12A consists onlyof a catalytic core. The 3D-structures for thecatalytic core domain of Cel6A ( Rou vinen et al.,
1990 ), Cel7A ( Divne et al., 1994 ), Cel7B ( Kleywegt
et al., 1997 ) and the cellulose binding domain of
Cel7A ( Kraulis et al., 1989 ) and Cel7B ( Mattinen
et al., 1998 ) are sol ved. Recently, the 3D structure
of Cel12A was determined ( Sandgren et al., 2001 ).
For the cellobiohydrolases Cel6A and Cel7A, theactive site is located in a tunnel whereas the
endoglucanases, Cel7B and Cel12A, has the acti ve
site in an open cleft.
The aim of this study was to perform a
comparati ve characterisation of the enzymatic
properties of the less well studied endoglucanasesCel12A and Cel45A. The catalytic core domain ofCel45A was included to compare with Cel12A, theendoglucanase of T. reesei which does not ha veaCBM. The two more well studied endoglucanases
Cel5A and Cel7B were included for comparison.
Both Cel12A and Cel45A ha ve a lower molecular
mass compared with the other cellulases of T.
reesei , 25 and 23 kDa, respecti vely. A wide range
of substrates for the enzymes ha ve been studied,
including microcrystalline and amorphous cellu-lose, soluble carbohydrate polymers and cello-oligosaccharides. Only a few studies ha ve been
published on the low molecular mass endogluca-
nases Cel12A ( Ha˚kansson et al., 1978; U ¨lker and
Sprey, 1990; Hayn et al., 1993; Okada et al., 1998,2000 ) and Cel45A ( Saloheimo et al., 1994 ). In
these studies, both Cel12A and Cel45A showedactivity against carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)
and filter paper but not against A vicel. A number
of studies ha ve been performed on the enzymatic
properties of the more well known Cel5A ( Shoe-
maker and Brown, 1978; Henrissat et al., 1985;van Tilbeurgh and Claeyssens, 1985 ) and Cel7B
(Ha˚kansson et al., 1979; Shoemaker et al., 1983b;
Bhikhabhai et al., 1984; Henrissat et al., 1985 ).
Howe ver, there is a lack of systematic studies of
the product formation during hydrolysis of micro-crystalline, amorphous and soluble cellulose sub-
strates. One important aspect of our study has
been to in vestigate if there are any distinct
differences between the enzymes which couldexplain why T. reesei produces se veral endogluca-
nases. There is currently ongoing work on struc-ture determination of Cel45A (Jerry Sta ˚hlberg,
personal communication). In this context it is vital
to ha ve information about the enzymatic proper-
ties of the enzymes. Furthermore, a more thor-
ough understanding of the acti vity of these
endoglucanases is important for the applicationsof the enzymes, e.g. in constructing a moreefficient cellulase mixture for total hydrolysis ofcellulose.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Enzymes
Cel12A (EG III) from T. reesei was purified by
chromatographic methods from the culture filtrateproduced and processed as described in Pere et al.J. Karlsson et al. / Journal of Biotechnology 99 (2002) 63 /C1/78 64
(1995) . The strain used for enzyme production
(kindly pro vided by Roal Oy, Finland) was
genetically modified as described by Suominen et
al. (1993) so that the genes coding for Cel5A (EG
II) and Cel6A (CBH II) were deleted. Purity of theenzyme preparations was monitored by gel elec-trophoresis techniques using 12.5% polyacryl-amide gels (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Swe-den) for sodiumdodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and IEF 3 /C1
/9 gels
(Amersham Biosciences) for isoelectric focusing inPhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences) accordingto manufacturer’s instructions. Protein amountsduring the chromatographic purification wereestimated on the basis of absorbance at 280 nm.Protein concentration of the raw enzyme concen-trates and purified enzyme preparations were
assayed by the method of Lowry et al .(1951) .
The concentrated culture filtrate (227 g protein)
was treated with bentonite as described by Zur-
briggen et al .(1990) to adsorb impurities and to
remo ve the precipitates formed in the concentra-
tion. The clarified sample was equilibrated with 7mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 by gelfiltration (Sephadex G-25 coarse, Amersham Bio-
sciences) and applied to an anion exchange column
of DEAE Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences),equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution wasperformed first with the starting buffer to remo ve
unadsorbed proteins and thereafter 12.5 mMsodium acetate, pH 7.2 with increasing concentra-tion of sodium chloride. A pool containing Cel12A(5.26 l, 10.9 g protein) was collected from the
fractions that were neither adsorbed nor retarded
in the column by the equilibration buffer.
The pool containing Cel12A was applied to a
column of Phenyl Sepharose FF (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with 20 mM sodiumphosphate at pH 6.0 containing 0.35 mol l
/C281
(NH 4)2SO 4, after it had been adjusted to the
corresponding pH and conducti vity by ammonium
sulphate. The unadsorbed material was eluted by
equilibrating buffer and the other adsorbed pro-teins by 20 mM sodium phosphate and water.Cel12A was tightly adsorbed to the column andwas eluted by 5 M urea, after which the columnwas washed by 6 M urea. The collected pool (4.4 l,ca. 0.7 g protein) was equilibrated to the con-ducti vity and pH of 12 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8
and applied to a cation exchange column (CM
Sepharose FF, Amersham Biosciences), equili-brated with the same buffer. The bound proteinswere eluted with a combined pH and ionic strengthgradient from 12 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8 /C1
/25
mM sodium acetate, pH 5.4, and after that by 1 MNaCl. Fractions containing Cel12A, which elutedat the end of the gradient were combined (ca. 0.34
g protein in 0.57 l) for further purification.
Final purification was achie ved by gel filtration.
A part of the collected pool from the cationexchange chromatography was concentrated byultrafiltration (Amicon, PM 10 membranes) to 12ml (ca. 0.21 g protein) and applied to a column ofSephacryl S-100 HR (5.0 /C29
/88 cm, Amersham
Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM sodium
acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 100 mM NaCl.
The elution was carried out with the same buffer.The fractions containing Cel12A were combined intwo pools and concentrated by ultrafiltration(Amicon, PM 10 membranes) to final volumes
103 ml (pool I) and 20 ml (pool II) with 180 g (I)and 27 mg (II) of protein. The purified Cel12Ashowed a single band in SDS-PAGE and IEF,
corresponding to the reported molecular mass and
isoelectric point of the protein ( Okada et al., 2000 ).
Cel45A (EG V) was purified from the culture
filtrate of a T. reesei strain lacking the genes
expressing the two major endoglucanases Cel7B(EGI) and Cel5A (EG II). The strain was geneti-cally modified as described by Suominen et al .
(1993) . The culture filtrate was pH adjusted to pH
6.0 and applied to a column with DEAE Sephar-
ose FF. The protein was eluted with a NaClgradient from 0 to 0.2 M. The fractions containingCel45A were pooled and the buffer was adjusted to0.02 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and 0.5 M(NH
4)2SO 4. The pooled fractions were applied to
a column with Phenyl Sepharose FF. For elution agradient of decreasing concentration of sodium
acetate and (NH
4)2SO 4was used where Cel45A
was eluted with 1 mM sodium acetate. The pooledfractions with Cel45A were pH adjusted to pH 3.0with 5 mM acetic acid/sodium acetate and appliedto a SP Sepharose FF column. Cel45A was elutedwith a NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 M. The finalstep in the purification was gel filtration per-J. Karlsson et al. / Journal of Biotechnology 99 (2002) 63 /C1/78 65
formed with a Sephacryl S100 HR column equili-
brated with 0.05 M sodium acetate and 0.15 M
sodium chloride at pH 5.0. The purified Cel45Ashowed a single band in SDS-PAGE after sil ver
staining.
Cel45Acore was purified from the culture fil-
trate of a T. reesei strain constructed for expres-
sion of the protein in glucose-containing medium,as described by Nakari-Seta ¨la¨and Penttila ¨(1995) .
In glucose medium all other cellulases are re-
pressed ( Ilme´n, 1997 ). The purification of Cel45A-
core followed a similar procedure as for thepurification of the full length Cel45A. The fulllength Cel45A and the core protein Cel45Acorewere eluted at different salt concentrations in thechromatography step with Phenyl Sepharose FFcolumn. The final gel filtration step was not
performed; the Cel45Acore preparation was pure
after the cation exchange step on SP Sepharose FFcolumn at pH 3.0 (5 mM acetic acid/sodiumacetate) and elution with NaCl gradient from 0to 0.5 M. The purity of the Cel45Acore prepara-tion was verified with SDS-PAGE where the
preparation showed a single band after sil ver
staining.
Cel5A (EG II) was purified according to Rah-
kamo et al .(1996) . The purity of the Cel5A
preparation was verified with SDS-PAGE after
silver staining. Cel7B (EG I) was purified from a
culture filtrate of T. reesei QM9414. The culture
filtrate was buffer exchanged to 20 mM ammoni-um acetate pH 7.0 in a Sephadex G25 column(Amersham Biosciences). The purification was
performed in two anion-exchange steps. In the
first step a Source Q column (Amersham Bio-sciences) was used with a linear gradient ofammonium acetate, pH 7.0, from 20 mM to 1M. The second step was performed as abo ve
except that the pH was decreased to 6.5. Thepurification was performed at room temperatureusing a FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences).
The purity of the Cel7B preparation was verified
with SDS-PAGE after sil ver staining.
2.2. Substrates and chemicals
Avicel and glucose were obtained from Sigma
(St. Louis, MI, USA). Phosphoric acid swollencellulose (PASC) was prepared from A vicel ac-
cording to Wood (1988) . CMC was from ICN
(Costa Mesa, CA, USA). Barley b-glucan and
konjac glucomannan were from Megazyme (Bray,Ireland). Konjac glucomannan composition isapproximately 60% mannan and 40% glucoseand the polymer is partially acetylated whichmakes it water soluble. Cellobiose, cellotriose,cellotetraose and cellopentaose were from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany). Bo vine serum albumin
(BSA) was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA, USA).Other chemicals were of analytical grade.
2.3. Effect of pH on enzymatic acti vity
The pH effect on enzymatic acti vity for the
enzymes was determined on b-glucan, 5 g l
/C281,a t
408C. The substrate was hydrolysed for 30 min
and the production of reducing ends was analysedwith the DNS method using glucose as standard(Bailey and Ne valainen, 1981 ). BSA was present at
0.1 g l
/C281to stabilise the enzymes. The buffers used
were, pH 3, Na-citrate; pH 4, Na-acetate; pH 5,Na-acetate; pH 6, MES; pH 7, MOPS; pH 8, Tris;pH 9, Glycine; pH 10, Glycine. The pH was set
with either NaOH or HCl.
2.4. Temperature effect on enzymatic acti vity
The effect of temperature on endoglucanase
activity was determined on b-glucan, 5 g l
/C281,i n
50 mM Na-acetate at pH 5.0. The substrate washydrolysed for 30 min and the production of
reducing ends was determined with the DNS
method. BSA was present at 0.1 g l
/C281to stabilise
the enzymes.
2.5. Adsorption
The adsorption to A vicel (10 g l/C281) and PASC
(5 g l/C281) was studied with enzyme concentrations
of 0.5 mM endoglucanase in 50 mM Na-acetate at
pH 5.0. BSA was included at 1 g l/C281to stabilise
the enzymes and to reduce unspecific adsorption.The adsorption experiments were performed at48C. The adsorption time was between 3 min and
12 h. The substrate with adsorbed enzyme wasfiltered off using a 0.22 mm filter. The enzymeJ. Karlsson et al. / Journal of Biotechnology 99 (2002) 63 /C1/78 66
activity was analysed in the filtrate using CMC for
Cel5A and Cel7B, and b-glucan for Cel12, Cel45
and Cel45Acore. The acti vity was determined
using the DNS assay.
2.6. Product formation
The formation of products after hydrolysis on
different polymeric substrates was in vestigated
after a 1 h hydrolysis, at 40 8C. Enzyme at 0.25
mM was incubated with the substrate, 10 g l/C281
Avicel, 5 g l/C281PASC and 5 g l/C281CMC, in 50 mM
Na-acetate at pH 5.0. BSA was included at 0.1 g
l/C281in all experiments to stabilise the enzymes. The
Avicel and PASC hydrolysis were terminated by
filtering off the unhydrolysed substrate with a 0.22mm filter. The CMC hydrolysis was not terminated
but product formation was determined directlyafter 1 h. All experiments were analysed forproduction of soluble sugars immediately, within1 min. The soluble sugars (glucose to cellopen-
taose) were analysed on a Dionex HPLC system
with an anion exchange Carbopac PA100 columnand pulsed amperometric detection (Dionex, Sun-nyvale, CA, USA). The oligosaccharides were
eluted isocratically with 50 mM NaOH and witha simultaneous linear gradient of Na-acetate from50 to 300 mM. The detector was set with thefollowing pulse potentials and durations: E
1/C30 /0.05
V, 200 ms (sampling); E2/C30 /0.75 V, 200 ms
(cleaning); E3/C30 //C28 /0.15 V, 400 ms (reduction),
and a response time of 1 s. Glucose, cellobiose,cellotriose, cellotetraose and cellopentaose wereused as standards.
2.7. Kinetic studies of oligosaccharide hydrolysis
The kinetic constants were determined for
hydrolysis of cellotriose, cellotetraose and cello-pentaose. The enzyme and substrate concentra-tions used are listed in Table 1 . The substrate was
incubated with the enzyme for a specific time at
408C in 50 mM Na-acetate at pH 5.0, and 0.1 g
l
/C281BSA was present. The hydrolysis was termi-
nated by adding NaOH to a final concentration of0.4 M. The hydrolysate was analysed immediatelyon a HPLC system as described abo ve. The kineticconstants were calculated with a Linewea ver/C1
/
Burke plot.
2.8. Hydrolysis of b-glucan and glucomannan
The hydrolytic acti vity on b-glucan and konjac
glucomannan for Cel12A, Cel45Acore, Cel5A andCel7B was studied. The enzyme concentrationswere 0.5 mM for Cel12A and Cel45Acore and 0.25
mM for Cel5A and Cel7B. The substrate (5 g l
/C281)
was dissol ved in 50 mM Na-acetate at pH 5.0,
BSA (0.1 g l/C281) was present to stabilise the
enzymes. The hydrolysis was performed at roomtemperature for 9 h. The hydrolysate was analysedon a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) systemwith 200 mM ammonium-acetate, pH 5.0, aselution buffer at 0.5 ml min
/C281. Two TSK G3000
SW columns (Tosohaas, Stuttgart, Germany) were
connected in series and the eluate was analysedwith a refracti ve index detector ERC-7515A
(ERMA Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Dextran standardswith molecular mass of 5.2, 25, 50 and 80 kDawere used to calibrate the system.
3. Results
The enzymatic properties were studied for the
low molecular mass endoglucanases Cel12A andCel45A of T. reesei . For Cel45A, the studies
included both the full length enzyme and thecatalytic core domain (Cel45Acore) produced afterdeletion of the CBM by genetic engineering. The
more well-studied endoglucanases Cel5A and
Cel7B were included for comparison.
3.1. Effect of pH on enzymatic acti vity
The effect of pH on hydrolysis was studied for
Cel12A, Cel45Acore and Cel5A with the solublepolymeric substrate b-glucan during a 30 min
hydrolysis, Fig. 1 . At acidic pH values, Cel12A
showed a distinctly different beha viour compared
with the other enzymes. Cel12A had maximumactivity at pH 5. The acti vity decreased more
rapidly when decreasing the pH than when thepH was increased; more than 50% of the maximalactivity was retained at pH 7 compared with onlyJ. Karlsson et al. / Journal of Biotechnology 99 (2002) 63 /C1/78 67
25% at pH 4. Also Cel45Acore showed maximal
activity at pH 5, howe ver, Cel45Acore retained
more than 75% of its maximal acti vity between pH
3 and 6. Abo ve pH 6 the acti vity dropped rapidly
and no acti vity could be detected at pH 8 and
higher. For Cel5A the highest acti vity was ob-
tained at pH 4. The maximum acti vity range was
broad, with 85% of maximum at pH 3 and 5. Theactivity decreased to 50% at pH 7, and reached 0 at
pH 10.3.2. Temperature effect on enzymatic hydrolysis
The effect of temperature on hydrolysis of b-
glucan at pH 5 was determined for Cel12A,Cel45Acore and Cel5A, Fig. 2 . The incubation
time for each enzyme was 30 min. For Cel12Amaximal acti vity was shown at 50 8C. At 60 8C
the enzyme retained almost 90% of maximal
activity but less than 10% of maximal acti vity
was obtained at 70 8C. In contrast, Cel45AcoreTable 1

retained acti vity o ver a wide temperature range,
clearly wider than for the other endoglucanases.Maximal acti vity was obser ved at 60 8C but more
than 70% of maximal acti vity was retained be-
tween 40 and 70 8C. For Cel5A the acti vity at
708C was higher than for the other endogluca-
nases. The acti vity increased up to 70 8C where
maximal acti vity was retained during the 30 min
incubation. At 80 8C only 10% of the acti vity was
retained.
3.3. Adsorption to cellulose substrates
The adsorption of Cel12A, Cel45A, Cel45Acore,
Cel5A and Cel7B to A vicel and PASC was studied,
Fig. 3 A and B. The adsorption was studied at
48C to minimise substrate change due to enzy-
matic acti vity. Furthermore, BSA (1 g l
/C281) was
included to reduce unspecific adsorption of theenzymes. The substrate with bound enzyme wasfiltered off and the filtrate was analysed for
enzyme acti vity.
The weakest adsorption to A vicel was shown by
Cel12A ( Fig. 3 A). About 20% of Cel12A adsorbed
to A vicel within 3 min, and no major changes in
adsorption were detected o ver time. Cel45A ad-
sorbed strongly to A vicel, with 90% adsorbed after60 min. Cel45A continued to adsorb to A vicel at
longer adsorption times with 100% of the enzymeadsorbed at 12 h. The same enzyme lacking CBM,Cel45Acore, adsorbed as Cel45A up to 30 min
where more than 85% was adsorbed. Cel45Acore
desorbed from the substrate at longer incubationtimes, but after 12 h 75% of the enzyme was stilladsorbed to A vicel. Both Cel5A and Cel7B
showed strong adsorption on A vicel, with 85%
adsorbed after 30 min, and the adsorption re-mained constant during the 12 h.
The majority of the studied endoglucanases,
Cel5A, Cel7B, Cel45A and Cel45Acore, showed
stronger adsorption to PASC compared withAvicel ( Fig. 3 B). No desorption of these enzymes
could be detected up to 12 h. In contrast, Cel12Aadsorbed to 60% after 3 min and a desorption wasobser ved up to 12 h when 30% of Cel12A was still
adsorbed to the substrate.
3.4. Product formation after hydrolysis of
polymeric substrates
The products formed after hydrolysis of A vicel,
PASC and CMC were analysed with HPLC ( Fig.
4). Samples were analysed after 1 h hydrolysis at
408C. The degree of con version for each sub-

of the endoglucanases for 30 min in 50 mM Na-acetate, pH 5.0, at different temperatures with b-glucan, 5 g l/C281. The experiments were
performed in triplicates with a S.D. of below 10%. The hydrolysis of the substrate was analysed with the DNS assay. ", Cel12A; j,

hydrolysis (data not shown) the product pattern
was similar to what was obser ved after 1 h
hydrolysis for all the enzymes studied.For Cel12A, the products formed on all sub-
strates were glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose and
cellotetraose ( Fig. 4 A). Trace amounts of cello-

ﬁlter. The ﬁltrate was then analysed for speciﬁc endoglucanase acti vity and the amount of adsorbed enzyme was subsequently
calculated. The substrate concentration was 10 g l/C281Avicel, and 5 g l/C281for PASC. A, adsorption to A vicel; B, adsorption to PASC;

product was cellobiose from all substrates. The
cellotetraose concentration was significant for allsubstrates, except for A vicel. The con version of
PASC to soluble sugars by Cel12A was 5.6%. The
corresponding figures for A vicel and CMC were
0.4 and 2.2%, respecti vely.
A notable difference in product formation
pattern relati ve to the other endoglucanases was
obser ved for the Cel45A enzymes. The main
product was cellotetraose for both Cel45A and
Cel45Acore for all substrates after 1 h hydrolysis
(Fig. 4 B/C1
/C). Both enzymes produced significant
amounts of cellopentaose and cellotriose. Cel45A
also produced low amounts of glucose and cello-
biose, whereas Cel45Acore only produced trace
amounts of cellobiose from CMC. The con version
of the substrates was low for both Cel45A andCel45Acore, and there was no significant differ-
ence between the core and the full length enzyme
on any substrate ( Table 2 ).
The products formed by Cel5A were glucose,
cellobiose and cellotriose on all substrates, and
trace amounts of cellotetraose were also detected
from PASC ( Fig. 4 D). The main product was
cellobiose on A vicel and PASC, and glucose from
CMC. The cellotriose concentration was signifi-
cant for all substrates. The product formationpattern for Cel7B showed mainly glucose and
cellobiose from all substrates ( Fig. 4 E). The main
product was cellobiose from A vicel and PASC,
and glucose from CMC. Cel7B produced trace
amounts of cellotriose from PASC. The con ver-sion of the substrates was similar for Cel5A and
Cel7B on A vicel and PASC where 0.8 and about
7.0% were con verted, respecti vely. A difference in
conversion was obser ved for CMC: Cel5A con-
verted 3.7% whereas Cel7B con verted only 2.7%.
3.5. Kinetic studies for oligosaccharide hydrolysis
The steady state kinetic constants for Cel12A,
Cel45core, Cel5A and Cel7B were determined for
hydrolysis of cellotriose, cellotetraose and cello-
pentaose, Table 3 . The kinetic constants were
determined at 40 8C. The substrate concentrations
used ( Table 1 ) were both higher and lower than the
calculated k
Mvalue.
For cellopentaose, Cel12A, Cel5A and Cel7B
hydrolysed this substrate efficiently, whereas nohydrolysis was obser ved for Cel45Acore. Cel12A
had a four times higher k
M(230 mM) and about
ten times lower kCat(14 s/C281) compared with
Cel7B. The kMvalues for Cel5A and Cel7B were
very similar ( : /50mM), but the kCatfor Cel7B was
a factor of two higher (118 s/C281).
Cellotetraose was a substrate for Cel5A, Cel7B
and Cel12A but not for Cel45Acore. The kMfor
Cel12A and Cel5A was in the same range ( : /400
mM). Cel12A had a kCatmore than ten times lower
(0.8 s/C281) than Cel5A. Cel7B had a lower kMand a
higher kCatcompared with Cel5A.
Neither Cel12A nor Cel45Acore showed any
detectable hydrolysis on cellotriose. No hydrolysiswas obser ved with 0.5 mM enzyme and 0.5 mM
Fig. 4. Production of oligosaccharides on different polymeric cellulose substrates. The endoglucanase (0.25 mM) was incubated with
the substrate, and the hydrolysate was analysed by HPLC for the formation of oligosaccharides. The experiments were performed intriplicates with a S.D. of below 10% for each oligosaccharide. The substrate concentration was 10 g l
/C281Avicel, 5 g l/C281PASC and
CMC. The hydrolysis was performed at 40 8C for 1 h in 50 mM Na-acetate pH 5.0. A, Cel12A; B, Cel45A; C, Cel45Acore; D, Cel5A;

The substrate was incubated with the enzyme for 1 h and the produced oligosaccharides were analysed with HPLC. The experiments
were performed in triplicates with a S.D. of below 10%. The experimental conditions were the same as in Fig. 4 .J. Karlsson et al. / Journal of Biotechnology 99 (2002) 63 /C1

substrate incubated for 120 min. Only Cel7B
hydrolysed cellotriose at a significant rate. Theproblem with Cel7B was that the kinetic constantscould not be determined due to analytical pro-blems when the substrate concentration was in-creased. Howe ver, the k
Mseemed to be in the mM
range. Cel5A hydrolysed cellotriose very slowly,
only 10% of the substrate was hydrolysed in 120
min (0.5 mM enzyme and 0.5 mM cellotriose). Due
to the low hydrolysis rate, the kinetic constantswere not determined for Cel5A hydrolysis ofcellotriose.
3.6. Hydrolysis of b-glucan and glucomannan
The hydrolytic capacity of Cel12A, Cel45Acore,
Cel5A and Cel7B were determined on the soluble
polymers b-glucan and konjac glucomannan, Fig.
5. The polymers were analysed after 9 h hydrolysis
using a SEC system. The hydrolysate was notanalysed with the HPLC system due to the lack ofstandards.
b-Glucan was hydrolysed to a significant extent
with Cel12A, Cel5A and Cel7B as can be seen in
the increase in elution volume compared with the
non-hydrolysed substrate, Fig. 5 A. The mean
molecular mass of the formed products was inthe range of 5 kDa when compared with thedextran standards. The opposite was obser ved
for Cel45Acore; there was only a limited increasein elution volume compared with the non-hydro-
lysed substrate. Howe ver, Cel45Acore was able to
hydrolyse glucomannan to a high extent, Fig. 5 B.
The products formed exhibit a peak in thechromatogram from below 5 up to 50 kDacompared with the dextran standards. The otherthree endoglucanases were also able to hydrolyse
glucomannan, but to a lesser extent than Cel45A-
core. Cel12A was less efficient than Cel5A andCel7B on both substrates.
4. Discussion
4.1. Adsorption to cellulose substrates
Cel12A adsorbed to both A vicel and PASC
(Fig. 3 ). Howe ver, the affinity was lower than for
the other cellulases which can be explained by thelack of CBM in Cel12A. Most surprising was thatboth the full length Cel45A and Cel45Acoreadsorbed significantly to A vicel and PASC. A
difference between the core and the full lengthCel45A was obser ved on A vicel where the core
desorbed with time; about 75% of the core was
adsorbed after 12 h compared with 100% for thefull length enzyme. Howe ver, the adsorption on
PASC was very similar for Cel45A and Cel45A-
core. Thus, a significant difference in adsorptionwas obser ved between Cel12A and Cel45Acore,Table 3

An appropriate amount of enzyme was incubated with the oligosaccharide for a specific time at 40 8C (see Table 1 ). The hydrolysis
was terminated with NaOH and immediately analysed with HPLC.J. Karlsson et al. / Journal of Biotechnology 99 (2002) 63 /C1

which both lack the CBM. Howe ver, it has been
shown that adsorption to steam pretreated spruceby the full length and core domain of Cel5A was
similar, whereas the same experiment for Cel7Ashowed a decrease in adsorption for the core
domain ( Kotiranta et al., 1999 ). The core domains
of Cel6A and Cel7A ha ve been shown to adsorb to
Avicel and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose
Fig. 5. Hydrolysis of barley b-glucan ( A) and soluble konjac glucomannan ( B) by Cel5A, Cel7B, Cel12A and Cel45Acore. The
substrate (5 g l/C281in 50 mM Na-acetate, pH 5.0) was incubated with the enzyme (0.5 mM Cel12A and Cel45Acore; 0.25 mM Cel5A and
Cel7B) at room temperature for 9 h. The hydrolysates were analysed using SEC. Dextran standards are marked for a mean molecular
mass comparison.J. Karlsson et al. / Journal of Biotechnology 99 (2002) 63 /C1/78 74
(BMCC) but with lower affinity than the full
length enzyme ( Tomme et al., 1988; Sta ˚hlberg et
al., 1991; Palonen et al., 1999 ). Similar results were
obtained on BMCC and cotton for Cel7B coredomain and full length enzyme ( Srisodsuk, 1994 ).
Howe ver,Tomme et al .(1988) showed that Cel7A
core domain adsorbed almost as much as the fulllength enzyme on PASC, whereas Cel6A coredomain showed significantly decreased adsorption
compared with the full length enzyme on the same
substrate. Hence, the core domains of the cellu-lases are able to adsorb to cellulose, but often withlower affinity than the full length enzyme. Further-more, the core domains for the different cellulasesadsorb with different affinity to cellulose sub-strates.
4.2. Hydrolytic properties of Cel12A
Cel12A hydrolysed A vicel, PASC and CMC,
Fig. 4 A. The con version was highest on PASC and
lowest on A vicel, Table 2 . Howe ver, the con ver-
sion is lower than that obser ved for Cel5A and
Cel7B, but significantly higher than for Cel45Aand Cel45Acore. The main product of Cel12Ahydrolysis of the substrates was cellobiose. After
24 h the cellotetraose, which was obser ved after 1 h
of hydrolysis, had been hydrolysed but cellotriosewas still a significant product (data not shown).This was confirmed in the kinetic studies, Table 3 ,
where cellotriose was not a substrate for Cel12Abut the longer oligosaccharides were. Contrary toearlier reports ( U¨lker and Sprey, 1990 ) stating that
Cel12A does not hydrolyse A vicel, our results
show that Cel12A adsorbs to A vicel, and that
Avicel is hydrolysed by Cel12A. The low acti vity
of Cel12A on A vicel, compared with Cel5A and
Cel7B, can partly be explained by the low adsorp-tion. Cel12A was highly acti veo n b-glucan and it
was also able to hydrolyse glucomannan, Fig. 5 ,
but Cel12A was less acti ve than Cel5A and Cel7B
on both substrates. Thus, the hydrolytic properties
of Cel12A is similar to Cel5A on all substrates
tested. Howe ver, Cel5A is an endoglucanase with
higher acti vity compared with Cel12A.
The acti vity of Cel12A on cellotetraose and
cellopentaose was significantly lower than that ofCel5A and Cel7B, as shown by the k
Catvalues inTable 3 . The kinetic constants for Cel5A and
Cel7B were similar. The turno ver numbers on the
chromophoric substrates 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-b-
D-cellobioside (CNPG 2) and 2-chloro-4-nitro-
phenyl- b-D-cellotrioside (CNPG 3)h a ve been de-
termined for Cel12A to be 0.11 and 1.1 s/C281,
respecti vely ( Hayn et al., 1993 ). Furthermore, the
turno ver number for Cel7B on CNPG 2has been
reported to be 44 s/C281and for Cel5A on CNPG 3to
be 4.5 s/C281(Nidetzky and Claeyssens, 1994 ). It was
surprising that Cel12A was able to hydrolyseCNPG
2since this substrate is supposed to mimic
cellotriose, a substrate for which we did notobser ve any Cel12A acti vity. Howe ver, the turn-
over number for Cel12A was significantly lower
than for Cel7B on CNPG
2. The turno ver number
for Cel5A on CNPG 3was four times higher than
that determined for Cel12A. On cellotetraose we
obser ved an approximately 20 times higher turn-
over number for Cel5A compared with Cel12A
(Table 3 ). Thus, the kinetic constants on chromo-
phoric substrates showed similar differences be-tween the endoglucanases as the kinetic studiesreported here, i.e. Cel5A and Cel7B had higherturno ver number than Cel12A. The kinetic con-
stants ha ve also been determined for Humicola
insolens endoglucanases ( Schou et al., 1993 ). Hi
Cel12A hydrolysed cellotetraose and longer oligo-saccharides. The turno ver number on cellopen-
taose was 0.0016 s
/C281for Hi Cel12A and 0.029 and
40 s/C281for Hi Cel5A and Hi Cel7B, respecti vely.
Hence, the Cel12A endoglucanase is the leastefficient endoglucanase in both T. reesei and H.
insolens when compared with Cel5A and Cel7B.
The kinetic constants ( k
Cat/kM) obtained here
for Cel7B on cellotetraose (1 s/C281mM/C281) and
cellopentaose (2 s/C281mM/C281) were significantly
higher than the kCat/kMvalues determined at
258C reported by Biely et al. (1991) (0.04 and
0.02 s/C281mM/C281, respecti vely). The difference in
temperature can partly explain the discrepancy, as
we determined the kinetic constants at 40 8C.
Furthermore, we used substrate concentrationsbetween 30 and 250 mM for cellotetraose and
10/C1
/200mM for cellopentaose whereas Biely et al.
determined the constant at 25 mM. The transgly-
cosylation acti vity increases with an increase in
substrate concentration. Determining the kineticJ. Karlsson et al. / Journal of Biotechnology 99 (2002) 63 /C1/78 75
constants using steady-state kinetics might not be
optimal for a retaining enzyme, i.e. an enzyme
with transglycosylation acti vity.
4.3. Hydrolytic properties of Cel45A
Cel45A and Cel45Acore beha vedvery similarly
in their hydrolysis of all substrates studied. Themain product from A vicel, PASC and CMC was
cellotetraose with significant amounts of cello-
triose and cellopentaose, Fig. 4 B and C. The
product formation pattern after 1 h hydrolysiswas similar to what was obser ved after 24 h
hydrolysis. The product formation pattern forCel45A was thus distinctly different from the otherT. reesei endoglucanases. The con version was low
on all substrates, between 0.1 and 0.9% for A vicel
and CMC, respecti vely (Table 2 ). Interestingly, the
conversion was higher on CMC compared with
PASC, where the opposite was obser ved for the
other endoglucanases. Howe ver, after 24 h hydro-
lysis both the full length and the core domainproduced more soluble sugars from PASC thanfrom CMC, 5.0 and 2.1%, respecti vely. Appar-
ently, CMC has some sites which can rapidly behydrolysed by Cel45A, which then become de-
pleted. On the other hand PASC has more
hydrolysable sites than CMC; howe ver, the hydro-
lysis is slower at these sites. Cel45Acore readilyhydrolysed soluble konjac glucomannan and itwas the most efficient endoglucanase on thissubstrate, Fig. 5 . All T. reesei endoglucanases
have been reported to be able to hydrolyse
glucomannan ( Biely and Tenkanen, 1998 ), which
is in agreement with our results. We ha ve obser ved
that Cel45Acore does not hydrolyse mannan orgalactomannan and
1H-NMR studies on konjac
glucomannan hydrolysed by Cel45Acore showedonly glucose reducing end protons (unpublishedresults). Thus, Cel45Acore was able to hydrolyseglucomannan between two glucose units or possi-bly between a glucose and a mannose unit where
the glucose was in the /C28
/1 subsite in the acti ve site
of the enzyme. Moreo ver, these NMR studies also
clearly showed that Cel45A is not a mannanasesince mannose reducing end protons were notobser ved in the glucomannan hydrolysate. For
Cel45Acore we obtained higher hydrolysis ofglucomannan compared with b-1,4-glucan sub-
strates and no acti vity was found on other
mannans. Thus, these results taken together in-dicate that Cel45A is a glucomannanase ratherthan a strict endoglucanase.
No acti vity was obser ved for Cel45Acore on
cellotriose, cellotetraose and cellopentaose, Table
3, which is in agreement with the production
pattern on A vicel, PASC and CMC where these
oligosaccharide products were not further de-
graded. Howe ver, Cel45A of H. insolens was able
to hydrolyse cellotetraose and longer oligosacchar-ides ( Schou et al., 1993 ). Furthermore, Hi Cel45A
showed a higher turno ver number than both Hi
Cel5A and Hi Cel12A but lower than Hi Cel7B.Apparently, the Cel45A endoglucanases of T.
reesei and H. insolens are significantly different
even though they both belong to the same glyco-
side hydrolase family.
