SUMMARY 
An endo-a-D-(1 + 3).glucanase capable of hydrolyzing 
various ~(1 -+ 3).glucans has been isolated and purified 
from the culture filtrate of the cellulolytic fungus Tricho- 
derma viride, and its specificity has been examined. Of the 
compounds tested only those with oc-(1 ---f 3).glucosidic 
linkages were attacked, and the enzymatic hydrolysis oc- 
curred with retention of configuration of the anomeric carbon 
atom involved in cleavage. 
Some properties of the enzyme have been investigated. 
Optimum pH and temperature for activity are 4.5 and SO”, 
respectively. The values of K, and V,,, under standard 
assay conditions are 4.6 X 10K2 M glucose equivalents and 
0.16 pmole of glucose equivalent per min. The molecular 
weight of the enzyme estimated by column chromatography 
on Sephadex G-100 was found to be approximately 47,000. 
Zn++ and Fe++ were found to be reversible inhibitors of the 
enzyme while Ag+ and Hg+ abolished activity irreversibly. 
The use of this enzyme in structural carbohydrate chem- 
istry is discussed. 
The biological functions of a great majority of polysaccharides, 
especially in the plant kingdom, are not understood. The key 
to much of the understanding of their roles lies in a knowledge of 
their chemical fine structure and the mechanisms of their synthe- 
sis and degradation. Studies of the structures of many polygly- 
cans have been greatly facilitated by the use of enzymes with 
rather strict specificity that cleave glycosidic linkages. The use 
of enzymatic methods in structural analysis of complex poly- 
saccharides has been of particular value in gaining an insight into

proteins (3, 4). 
There have been a few reports describing the presence of crude 
enzyme activities capable of hydrolyzing a-(1 --t 3).glucosidic 
linkages in higher plants and seaweeds; however, no enzyme 
specific for this linkage has been reported. Peat and Reese (5) 
prepared a crude enzyme from Porphyra umbilicalis which hydro- 
lyzed nigerose but was equally active on sucrose and maltose. 
A rather nonspecific nigerase activity has also been described in 
extracts of alfalfa, protozoa, and yeast (6). An activity in 
Streptomyces capable of hydrolysis of yeast cy-(1 ---f 3)-glucans 
has recently been reported (7). 
Enzyme activity specific toward a-(1 + Y)-glucosidic linkages 
was first observed by us in culture filtrates of Trichoderma viride 
(8). When grown in a medium containing the oc-(1 + 3)-glucan 
(pseudonigeran) isolated from dspergillus niger, T. viride pro- 
duces the enzyme in its culture fluid. Of a number of fungal 
strains tested this species showed the highest activity. 
Polysaccharides which consist almost exclusively of a-(1 + 3)- 
glucosidic linkages have only recently been reported but appear 
to be important in cell wall structure. Ralph and Bender (9) 
obtained a preparation from the walls of the basidiomycite PoZg- 
porus tumulosus which yielded an c-r-(1 4 3).glucan fraction. 
Similar polymers have now been isolated from A. niger (lo), 
Polyporus betulinus (II), and, more recently, Cryptococcus and 
Schizosaccharomyces species of yeast (7). The present communi- 
cation details the purification and properties of a highly specific 
a-(1 -+ 3).glucanase with activity toward a variety of glucose- 
containing oligo- and polysaccharides containing or-(1 + 3).link- 
ages. 
MATERIALS 
A. niger NRRL 326 was obtained from the culture collect,ion 
of the Northern Regional Research Laboratory, United States 
Department of Agriculture, Peoria, Illinois, and T. viride QlH6a 
from the United States Army Natick Laboratories, Natick, Mas- 
sachusetts. The exo-/-n-(1 + 3).glucanase was purified as 
previously described (12). Polyporus tumulosus glucan was a 
gift from Dr. B. J. Ralph. Other polysaccharides were available 
in our laboratory collection.

Ion exchange resins IR120(H)+ and IR45(OH)- were obtained 
from Malinckrodt. Sephadex gels and blue dextran were pur- 
chased from Pharmacia. Hexamethyldisilazane, trimethyl- 
chlorosilazine, crystalline pepsin, trypsin, and pancreatic ribo- 
nuclease were obtained from Nutritional Biochemicals. Bovine 
serum albumin was purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxi- 
dase and hemoglobin were obtained from Worthington and cyto- 
chrome c from Mann. Reagents for polyacrylamide gel electro- 
phoresis were purchased from Distillation Products Industries 
Division of Eastman Kodak. 
All other chemicals were reagent grade and carbohydrates used 
were of the n configuration. 
Pseudonigeran was isolated from mycelia of A. niger NRRL 
326, which was grown in submerged culture with a Micro-Ferm 
laboratory fermentor, model MF-107 (New Brunswick Scientific 
Company, New Brunswick, New Jersey). Growth medium con- 
sisted of the following in grams per 10 liters: glucose, 466; tar- 
taric acid, 26.6; NHINOa, 26.6; (NH&SO+ 1.67; K&03, 4.66; 
MgCOa, 2.66; (NHk)HzPOd, 5.0; FeSO .7HzO, 0.466; ZnSO .7H20, 
0.466; and Hz0 to 10 liters. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 with 
concentrated NHPH. 
Two 150-ml portions of medium in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks 
were inoculated with A. niger spores and grown on a reciprocal 
shaker at 20-22’ for 6 days. They were then used to inoculate 
sterile culture medium in the fermentor. This culture was grown 
with an aeration rate of 2 liters per min at 25” for 6 days. Agita- 
tion was regulated at 100 rpm. The amount of pseudonigeran in 
the cells was found to fluctuate with changes in culture condi- 
tions. One factor controlling c+(l + 3)-glucan content in this 
particular strain of A. niger is the carbon source. Practically no 
pseudonigeran is present in cells grown in surface culture with 
either sucrose or glucose as carbon source. However, submerged 
culture favors the synthesis of pseudonigeran by the mycelia. 
While the reasons for this are unclear, it may be related to the 
structural nature of the mycelium under two diierent environ- 
ments. In addition to nutritional conditions, other factors 
seem to influence the formation of the polymer. Six-day-old 
mycelia generally contained the maximum amount of poly- 
saccharide, and an initial culture medium pH of 5.0 and growth 
t,emperature of 25” resulted in the highest yield of the glucan. 
Mycelia were harvested by filtering the culture through cheese- 
cloth. The mycelia was then placed on a Buchner funnel, and 
excess water was removed by suction filtration. The cells (500 
to 600 g) were suspended in 4 liters of water and filtered again. 
This was repeated until the washings became colorless. The 
washed cell mass was suspended in 4 liters of water and auto- 
claved at 15 pounds pressure for 20 min. The suspension was 
filtered through cheesecloth while hot, and the mycelia were 
again extracted with 4 liters of boiling water for 20 min 
and washed with 3 to 4 liters of boiling water until the washings 
became colorless. The washed cells were then cooled and sus- 
pended in 4 liters of 0.1 M sodium borohydride solution, and the 
mixture was allowed to stand for several hours with occasional 
stirring. Without adjustment of the pH of the suspension, it 
was made 1 N with respect to NaOH and heated on a steam bath 
for 3 hours. The alkaline suspension was filtered through cheese- 
cloth, and the resulting brownish filtrate was cooled. Two vol- 
umes of methanol were added to the extract with vigorous stir- 
ring, and the mixture allowed to stand for 3 to 4 hours at room 
temperature. The precipitated polysaccharide was collected by 
centrifugation (1000 x g) and washed with a solution of meth- anol and water(3: 1, v/v) until the washings became free of color. 
The washed .precipitate was dissolved in 1 liter of 1 N NaOH, 
and a small amount of insoluble material was removed by filtra- 
tion through glass wool. The filtrate was treated with 2 volumes 
of methanol, and the resulting white precipitate was collected by 
centrifugation (1000 x g) and washed with methanol-water 
(3 : 1, v/v) three times. It was then suspended in a solution of 
methanol and 0.1 N acetic acid (3: 1, v/v). The suspension was 
allowed to stand for several hours with occasional stirring. The 
neutraliied precipitate was collected and washed with methanol- 
water (3:1, v/v) and then with water. It was again suspended 
in hot water, and the suspension was heated in a boiling water 
bath for 20 min and immediately centrifuged. The supernatant 
was discarded. This hot water extraction was repeated three 
times. The precipitate was finally washed with ethanol and 
ether three times each and dried under reduced pressure (yield, 
5.5 to 6 g). Pseudonigeran of this purity (PN 1) was used for 
induction of cu-1,3-glucanase by T. vi&k. 
For further purification, 5 g of polysaccharide (PN 1) were re- 
extracted three times with l-liter portions of boiling water. The 
suspension was finally centrifuged, the washed polysaccharide 
was dissolved in 400 ml of 1 N NaOH, and 450 ml of 0.3 M CuSOl 
solution were added (13, 14). The mixture was allowed to stand 
at 5” for 2 hours. The precipitate which formed was collected 
by centrifugation and washed with cold 1 N HCl until the washing 
became free of blue color. The polysaccharide was then washed 
with water until the washings became free of chloride ions. It 
was then redissolved in 400 ml of 1 N NaOH. Pseudonigeran 
(PN 2) was precipitated, washed, and dried as before (yield, 4.3 
to 4.7 g, [ar]n +257”, 0.6 1 N NaOH). 
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
Deionization of sugar solutions was performed with either 
BaCOa or a mixed bed resin column consisting of Amberlite IR- 
120 (H)+ and Amberlite IR-45 (OH)-. All sugar solutions were 
concentrated under reduced pressure at 45-50”. Descending 
chromatography was carried out at room temperature on What- 
man No 1 paper with, unless otherwise stated, the following 
solvent systems: Solvent I, butanol-acetic acid-HzO, 2: 1: 1, v/v 
(14); Solvent II, butanol-pyridine-HzO, 6:4:3, v/v (15); Sol- 
vent III, 2-propanol-acetic acid-H&, 54:8: 18, v/v (16). Sugars 
were detected on paper by the silver nitrate method of Trevelyan, 
Proctor, and Harrison (17). Nigerodextrins were prepared 
(from pseudonigeran) essentially by the method described by 
Johnston (lo), and the degree of polymerization was determined 
by a modification of the method of Whelan (18) of the phenol- 
sulfuric acid assay (19). Periodate oxidation of polysaccharides 
was performed by the method of Aspinall and Ferrier (20), but 
incubation was carried out with continuous stirring at 5” instead 
of 35”. Reduction of the products of periodate oxidation was 
performed by the method of Hamilton and Smith (21). Glycerol 
liberated from the Smith degradation of polysaccharide was de- 
termined by the method of Lambert and Neish (22). Total car- 
bohydrate was estimated by the phenol-sulfuric acid method of 
Dubois et. al. (19). Reducing sugars were determined by the 
method of Nelson-Somogyl (23). 
Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (24) 
with crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard and by 
absorbance at 280 rnp. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 
determined by the method of Whitaker (25). The (Y-(1 + 3)- 
glucanase used in this particular experiment was an ammonium  at PROCTER & GAMBLE CO on December 16, 2020 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from

sulphate fraction and was located by the standard assay described 
below. Peaks for cytochrome c, hemoglobin, and peroxidase 
were determined from absorbances of their solutions at 550, 405, 
and 405 mp, respectively. Other proteins were measured at 280 
mk 
Analytical disc gel electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel was 
carried out at pH 8.6 by the procedure of Ornstein and Davis 
(26) and at pH 4.5 according to the method of Reisfeld, Lewis, 
and Williams (27). 
Location of enzyme activity in the analytical gels was achieved 
by cutting the gel into 0.5-cm sections and eluting each in 1 ml of 
0.05 M citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.5 M sodium 
chloride in small test tubes. The gel section was smashed with a 
spatula, and the mixture was allowed to stand in the cold over- 
night. Twenty-five pliters of each fraction were then assayed by 
the micro method described below for the ability to hydrolyze 
pseudonigeran. 
Gas chromatography of products of the enzyme reaction was 
carried out according to the method of Sweeley et al. (28) and 
Parrish and Reese (29). The glass column (6 feet x l/4 inch) 
was packed with SE 30 (1%) on Anakrom 100 to 110 mesh. 
Column temperature was 140”. 
Enzyme Assays-The standard assay consisted of an incuba- 
tion of 0.5 ml of suitably diluted enzyme with 0.5 ml of 0.4% 
pseudonigeran suspension in 0.05 M citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 
4.5, at 40” for 10 min. Aliquots were then withdrawn for de- 
termination of reducing sugar. When necessary, after 
arsenmolybdate reagent was added, insoluble pseudonigeran was 
centrifuged (200 x g) directly in the tubes to prevent turbidi- 
metric interferences with calorimeter readings. 
One unit of enzyme is defined as that amount which will liber- 
ate 1.0 pmole of reducing sugar equivalent, expressed as glucose, 
per min under the standard assay conditions. Enzyme concen- 
tration is expressed as units per mg of protein. 
Determination of the ability of the enzyme to attack various 
polysaccharides or oligosaccharides was performed by the follow- 
ing micro scale procedure. Approximately 0.01 unit of enzyme 
was incubated with 100 pg of carbohydrate in solution or sus- 
pension in 0.05 M acetate or 0.03 M citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 
4.5, in a final volume of 50 pliters. The incubation was carried 
out in a sealed melting point capillary tube at 40” overnight, and 
the entire contents were then chromatographed directly in Sol- 
vent II for identification of reaction products. Controls without 
enzyme were included for each incubation. 
Enzyme Production-T. virid.e QM6A was grown in a medium 
containing glucose (0.3 %), pseudonigeran (0.3 %), and Tricho- 
delma-salts solution (30). 
The medium was disrupted by sonic oscillation until the pseu- 
donigeran became a fine suspension. Five 500-ml Erlenmeyer 
flasks, each containing 100 ml of disrupted medium, were pre- 
pared. The autoclaved flasks were inoculated with T. viricle 
QM6A spores and incubated on the reciprocal shaker at room 
temperature for 10 days. This time period allowed for maxi- 
mum accumulation of enzyme in the culture filtrate. 
Enzyme Purification-All steps were carried out a 04” unless 
specified otherwise. The culture filtrate (500 ml) was filtered 
through Whatman No. 1 paper, and the crude enzyme could be 
obtained by raising the cold solution to 75% of saturation with 
ammonium sulfate, followed by collection of the precipitate after 
12 hours, or by the use of membrane filtration (UM-1 ultrafilters 
and concentrating device, Amicon Corporation, Lexington, Mas- sachusetts). The pH was maintained between 4.5 and 6.5 dur- 
ing this process. The concentrated enzyme (9 ml) was dialyzed 
for 12 hours against several changes of distilled water. Any 
insoluble material in the dialyzed enzyme solution was removed 
by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 15 min. Enzyme could be 
frozen as the concentrated extract for several months without 
significant loss of activity. 
Three to 4 ml of the ammonium sulfate enzyme (15 mg of pro- 
tein) were chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G-150 
(2.5 X 35 cm) equilibrated with 0.15 M citrate-O.03 M phosphate 
buffer, pH 7.0, and eluted with the same buffer. The flow rate 
was adjusted to 0.15 ml per min. Fractions were assayed for 
enzymatic activity and absorbance at 280 mp. Tubes containing 
enzyme were combined and concentrated under reduced pres- 
sure with semipermeable collodion bags (Schleicher and Schuell). 
The yields from two G-150 column preparations were usually 
pooled before proceeding to the next step. 
A 3-ml sample of G-150 enzyme (8 to 10 mg of protein) was 
chromatographed on a DEAE-Sephadex column (1.8 x 17 cm) 
which was equilibrated with 0.015 M citrate-O.03 M phosphate 
buffer, pH 7.0. A flow rate of 0.1 ml per min was usually main- 
tained. Elution was carried out with 400 ml of buffer with a 
linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 0.5 M. Fractions 
with enzymatic activity were combined and concentrated to 0.5 
ml with a semipermeable membrane bag against water, and 0.5 ml 
of 0.3 M acetate buffer, pH 4.5, was added to the enzyme solution. 
The concentrated DEAE-Sephadex enzyme (2 to 3 mg of pro- 
tein) was applied to a Sulfoethyl-(SE-) Sephadex C-50 column 
(1.8 X 38 cm) previously equilibrated with 0.1 M acetate buffer, 
pH 4.5. A linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M sodium chloride in the 
same buffer was again employed with a flow rate of 0.1 to 0.15 
ml per min. Pooled fractions containing the enzyme were con- 
centrated as above and stored at 3”. The enzyme was found to 
be most stable when maintained in the pH range of 4.5 to 6 and 
could be kept for several months before significant loss of activity 
occurred. 
RESULTS 
Structure of Polysaccharidel-Pseudonigeran (PN 2, 5 mg) was 
suspended in 2 ml of 1 N H&lo4 and hydrolyzed for 12 hours at 
100” in a sealed glass vial. The polymer completely dissolved 
during this time. The hydrolysate was neutralized with BaC03 
and centrifuged. The concentrated supernatant was chromato- 
graphed in Solvents I and II. Glucose was the only product 
observed with the silver nitrate developer. 
Pseudonigeran (PN 2,85 mg) was suspended in 50 ml of 0.015 
M sodium periodate. In addition, 104 mg of nigeran suspended 
in an identical volume of periodate and incubated under the 
same conditions served as a standard. The results shown in 
Fig. 1 indicate 3.8 x lo-* mole of periodate consumed per mole 
of anhydrohexose residue in pseudonigeran. Nigeran consumed 
0.5 mole per mole of anhydrohexose, which is consistent with its 
structure. The very small consumption of periodate by pseu- 
donigeran supports the view that the material is (1 -+ 3)-linked. 
The average degree of polymerization of the polysaccharide 
was determined by a Smith degradation (32) of the molecule. 
When a linear glycan was subjected to this procedure, followed by 
mild acid hydrolysis, 1 molecule of glycerol released from the non-

FIG. 1. Pseudonigeran (85 mg) and nigeran (104 mg) were each 
suspended in 50 ml of 0.015 M sodium periodate solution. The

reducing end of each chain. It is therefore possible to calculate 
the degree of polymerization from the amount of liberated glyc- 
erol. 
Pseudonigeran (PN 2, 39.8 mg) was suspended in 50 ml of 
0.015 M sodium periodate in the dark at 5” with stirring. After 
16 days, 0.2 ml of ethylene glycol was added to destroy excess 
periodate. The oxidized pseudonigeran was centrifuged, washed 
with wa.ter, and resuspended in 10 ml of water. Forty milli- 
grams of sodium borohydride dissolved in 5 ml of water were 
added to the suspension, and the mixture was allowed to stand 
another 24 hours. The excess borohydride was destroyed by 
adding acetic acid to pH 6.0. The reduced polysaccharide was 
collected by centrifugation and washed exhaustively with water. 
The polysaceharide alcohol was suspended in 10 ml of 0.1 N 
HZS04 and stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. It was 
then centrifuged, and the supernatant was recovered. The 
precipitate was washed with water, and the washings and su- 
pernatant were combined. This solution was concentrated to 
dryness under reduced pressure at 50”, and 2 ml of water were 
added to the residue. It was then assayed for glycerol as de- 
scribed above in “Analytical Methods,” and 1.34 x lOma mole 
of glycerol was liberated per mole of anhydrohexose. Assuming 
an unbranched molecule (31), the degree of polymerization of 
this pseudonigeran preparation appears to be about 700, based 
on these results. 
Enzyme Production-The effects of growth period and con- 
centration of inducer, pseudonigeran, on CC-(1 ---f 3)glucanase 
production by T. wir& were investigated. The organism was 
grown as described above with increasing amounts of pseu- 
donigeran. The control medium contained 0.6% glucose but no 1.4 -

pseudonigeran. Periodically, 4-ml aliquots of growth culture 
were withdrawn, and the filtrate was assayed for enzyme activity 
by the standard enzyme assay. The results are shown in Fig. 2. 
The amount of enzyme activity induced was proportional to 
the amount of inducer added. For producing the enzyme, 0.3% 
inducer was routinely used. Maximum yield of enzyme was 
usually obtained in cultures after 8 to 10 days of growth. 
A much higher recovery of enzyme units was consistently ob- 
tained when the 75% ammonium sulfate fraction was allowed to 
stand overnight at 4’ before the precipitated protein was collected 
by centrifugation. The bulk. of the activity was found in the 
fraction obtained between 35 and 75% saturation. For large 
scale experiments, however, where 5 to 10 liters of culture filtrate 
were fractionated, ultrafiltration was a more efficient method of 
concentrating the enzyme. 
The result of a typical Sephadex G-150 column is shown in 
Fig. 3. Three major peaks were generally observed. The first 
minor peak corresponds to the void volume, while the activity 
eluted as a second peak in tubes 40 to 56. 
The elution pattern on DEAE-Sephadex is shown in Fig. 4.

only 60-fold reflects the relatively pure state of the enzyme in 
the culture filtrate. 
Properties of Enzyme-A photograph of an acrylamide gel of 
enzyme prepared by the above procedure is shown in Fig. 6. 
At pH 4.5 there appears to be a minor band moving slightly be- 
hid the enzyme. Only the major band contained any detect- 
able enzymatic activity as evidenced by sectioning, eluting, and 
assaying the gel fractions as detailed in “Analytical Methods.” 
At pH 8.3 the enzyme moved only slightly after several hours as 
a single band, but it could not be eluted in an active form. This 
was not unexpected since the enzyme does not retain its activity 
upon storage at pH values above 7. 
The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated by use of 
a Sephadex GlOO column (2.3 X 30 cm) equilibrated with 0.15 
M citrate-O.03 M phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. One milliliter of 
marker protein solution in the same buffer was applied to the 
column, and the flow rate was adjusted to 0.2 ml per min. Void 
volume was determined with a l-ml sample of 0.2yo blue dextran 
solution. A plot of relative elution volumes of markers and en-

from the experiment is approximately 47,000. 
The proportionality of the reaction to enzyme concentration 
and time is illustrated in Fig. 8. 
The influence of hydrogen ion concentration on enzymatic ac- 
tivity was investigated over the pH range 3 to 8. The assay 
was carried out under standard conditions, except for pH, and 
the results are shown in Fig. 9. The optimal pH, 4.5, typical of 
many carbohydrases (3, 12), was also found excellent for storage 
of the enzyme over long periods. 
Experiments conducted to determine initial reaction velocity 
as a function of temperature indicated that at 50” the enzyme is 
rapidly and irreversibly inactivated under standard assay con- 
ditions. A calculation of the activation energy for the enzy- 
matic hydrolysis with the integrated form of the Arrhenius equa- 
tion yielded a value of 7000 calories per mole. The rather high 
temperature maximum may in part reflect the effect of partial 
solubilization of the substrate on reaction rate. 
The influence of substrate concentration on the initial velocity 
of the reaction was determined, and the K, and Vmag values 
for the enzyme were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot 
shown in Fig. 10. 
The effect of various metal ions on enzyme activity was in- 
vestigated. All metal solutions were prepared as chloride salts

excellent substrate for thii type of study because periodate oxi- 
dation of (1 -+ 3) -linked glucans modifies only the terminal units 
of the polysaccharide, leaving the remainder of the chain unal- 
tered (35). For the preparation of modified substrate 300 mg 
of pseudonigeran (PN 1) were subjected to two successive Smith 
degradations. No acid hydrolysis was used following the second

most exclusively the cr-n-glucose derivative (Table IV). A small &n-glucose derivative peak was observed only in the samples 
incubated for 15 mm or longer. 
DISCUSSION 
Structure of Polysaccharide--The combined results of periodate 
oxidation, acid hydrolysis, optical rotation, and determination 
of degree of polymerization suggest very strongly that pseu- 
donigeran is an unbranched polymer composed almost entirely, 
if not exclusively, of a-(1 + 3)-linked glycopyranosyl units. 
Results obtained in the present investigation and by Horisberger 
(31) suggest the possibility of a very small percentage of (1 + 4) 
linkages near the reducing end of the molecule. This is indicated 
by a somewhat high amount of periodate consumed and formic 
acid produced compared to what is expected of a linear (1 -+ 3)- 
glucan. 
Johnston has also isolated from the cell wall of A. niger a 
highly dextrorotatory polysaccharide ([& + 233” N sodium hy- 
droxide) and characterized it as an a-(1 ---f 3)-glucan containing 
approximately 10% cr-(1 + 4) linkages (10). Since nigeran is 
hot water-soluble, while the ar-(1 + 3)-glucan is not, nigeran 
should be easily removed from hot water-insoluble materials. 
It is therefore not likely that the cu-(1 -+ 4) linkages found by 
Johnston are simply due to contaminating nigeran in his a-(1 
+ 3)-glucan preparation. The evidence seems to indicate that 
perhaps the polymer may contain varying amount of (1 -+ 4)- 
linked units. 
Additional structural information about the polysaccharide 
was provided by an examination of the products of partial acid 
hydrolysis of the polysaccharide. This process yielded a series 
of oligosaccharides, which were separated and identified by paper 
chromatography, enzymic hydrolysis, and determination of de- 
gree of polymerization. The results are in good agreement with 
those reported by Johnston for nigerodextrins (10). 
Properties of a-(1 + S)-Glucanase-Fungal CY- and /3-glycanases 
are generally extracellular enzymes with many properties in 
common. It is an easy task to remove the organism, leaving a 
cell-free culture filtrate, which can be used as a source of crude 
enzyme and which is partially purified by the fact that cell 
breakage is not needed to obtain the enzyme. Glucanases are 
also usually quite active enzymes even at relatively high tem- 
peratures, and the (1 -+ 3) -glucanase fits this pattern also. The 
optimum pH for the many fungal glycanases in 4 to 5, with very 
low activity below pH 2 and above pH 7. The enzymes are 
usually inactive above pH 8. Maximum stability seems to be 
in the range of pH 5 to 7 (37). This is again the case with the 
cr-(1 3 3)-glucanase. 
The K, value obtained for the CY-(1 + 3)-glucanase (4.6 X 
10e2 M) is quite large. It should be noted, however, that the 
initial velocity in the present system is measured by determining 
reducing sugars liberated during a IO-min incubation period. 
The evidence shows that the enzyme is of the endo type, and 
therefore the first reaction products are oligosaccharides rather 
than glucose. Since the molar reducing value of oligosaccharides 
is lower than that for glucose, the initial rate determined by 
measuring reducing power would result in a slightly lower ap- 
parent initial velocity at each substrate concentration tested, 
leading to a somewhat higher apparent K, value. Another 
reason, and probably the most important, may be the insolubility 
of the substrate. K, values determined with insoluble substrates 
do not characterize the enzyme in the same way as do values for  at PROCTER & GAMBLE CO on December 16, 2020 http://www.jbc.org/ Downloaded from

soluble substrates. The value of K, is obtained in the form of 
the total concentration of linkages with insoluble substrate 
whereas only those linkages which are exposed and accessible to 
the enzyme can be expected to influence the rate of formation of 
the enzyme substrate complex. Indeed, the values obtained 
with various insoluble substrates may reflect solubilization proc- 
esses rather than enzymatic affinity. 
Substrate Xpeci$city and Mechanism of Action-The enzyme 
freely attacks cr-(1 -+ 3) linkages, as evidenced by its ability to 
degrade certain compounds listed in Table III. Substitution 
near the glycosidic linkage being cleaved does not appear to be 
too critical since ar-(1 + 4) linkages on either side of the cr-(1 
3 3)-nigeran being cleaved do not abolish activity. It defi- 
nitely is inactive on p-(1 + 3) linkages, however, and in this 
sense the anomeric configuration of the bond being cleaved is 
critical. Finally, it would appear that the inability of the en- 
zyme to attack nigerose (Fig. 13) might indicate either that at 
least 3 glucose units are required for proper binding to the en- 
zyme or that 2 glucose units must be located penultimate to the 
a-(1 -+ 3) bond being hydrolyzed for there to be any demonstrable 
activity. 
The two usual patterns of enzymatic attack on polysaccharides 
are the removal from the nonreducing end of successive mono- 
saccharide or disaccharide units (exo enzymes) and the com- 
pletely random attack on all glycosidic bonds (endo enzymes). 
In the first instance, only the terminal bond is susceptible to en- 
zyme attack. In the second instance, all bonds are more or less 
equally susceptible. The modification of the terminal nonreduc- 
ing unit did not alter the rate of attack by the enzyme, but this 
treatment has been shown to inhibit the rate of attack of an exo- 
p-(1 3 3)-glucanase on laminarin by about 95% (35). The 
steady state determination of the degree of polymerization of the 
soluble products of the reaction also indicates quite clearly that 
the enzyme operates in an endo manner while the failure of the 
a-(1 + 3)-glucanase to react with nigerose further supports the 
idea that the enzyme operates by an endo mechanism. 
Analysis of the products of the enzymatic hydrolysis of pseu- 
donigeran by gas chromatography clearly shows that the glucose 
liberated is of the a configuration. Parrish and Reese (29) have 
recently shown that exo enzymes attack with inversion of con- 
figuration while all endo carbohydrases analyzed hydrolyze with 
retention of configuration. The present results are in complete 
agreement with their observations. Koshland (38) has proposed 
a mechanism to explain inversion and retention of configuration 
with carbohydrases, as well as the exchange reactions noted with 
some of these enzymes. 
A number of polysaccharides of microbial origin have been 
characterized as containing CC(1 --t 3)-glucosidic linkages. Their 
occurrence appears to be quite widespread in the cell walls of 
fungi, but their structural role in the organisms remains to be 
defined. The a-(1 -+ 3)-glucan of A. niger discussed above con- 
tains a small percentage of a-(1 ---f 4) linkages near the reducing 
end of the molecule, but whether these are structurally signifi- 
cant or arise from contamination by another polysaccharide has 
not been clearly established. It is interesting to note, however, 
that regions of both uniformity and nonuniformity of linkages 
have been established for certain mammalian and microbial 
polysaccharides involved in structural roles (39). Exhaustive 
digestion of these CC(1 + 3)-glucan preparations with the (r-(1 
---f 3)-glucanase, followed by fractionation and characterization of the digested material, might give some insight into the (1 + 4)- 
linked segments. 
Recent experiments in one of our laboratories has resulted in 
the isolation of a galactoglucan from the cell walls of A. n@er. 
Preliminary work indicates that the polymer is composed of 
CY- (1 --+ 3) -linked glucopyranose units and (1 + 5) -linked galacto- 
furanosyl units.a Because of the furanose form of galactose in 
the polymer, mild acid hydrolysis (pH 2) of the native material 
selectively cleaves the galactose units from the polymer and pre- 
cludes the isolation of either galactofuranosyl oligosaccharides or 
those containing both glucose and galactose. However, the use 
of the endo-a-(1 -+ 3)-glucanase has permitted the isolation of 
portions of the carbohydrate chains relatively intact and is aiding 
the study of this polymer’s structure. 
Since most fungal glucans characterized as (Y-(1 + 3) polymers 
have been identified only on the basis of partial acid hydrolysis 
‘and infrared or x-ray diffraction analysis (7), the use of CY-(1 + 
3)-glucanases in the determination of their fine structure will be 
useful, particularly if more than one type of glucosidic linkage is 
present or if branching occurs in these recently discovered mole- 
cules.
